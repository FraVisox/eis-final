The National Audit Office said the contract sealed by ministers last September with EDF to construct the country’s first new atomic reactors in two decades would provide “uncertain strategic and economic benefits”. Further, Brexit and Theresa May’s decision to quit an EU nuclear treaty could make the situation even worse, by triggering taxpayer compensation for EDF or a more generous deal for the French state-controlled company. The watchdog condemned the past two governments for failing to look at alternative ways of financing the power station, such as taking a stake in the construction. Observers labelled the report “deeply worrying”, a “strong reprimand” and a vindication of Hinkley Point C’s critics, who had argued it was too costly and advocated alternatives such as wind and solar power. Under the terms of the 35-year contract, EDF is guaranteed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour it generates, twice the wholesale price. The subsidy is paid through energy bills, which the government estimates will translate to a £10 to £15 chunk of the average household bill by 2030. At the heart of the spending watchdog’s criticism is the coalition government’s failure to look at any alternative financing model, such as taking an upfront stake in the £18bn project. Instead, the Lib Dems and Tories decided all the construction risk for the plant must lay with EDF and its partner, Chinese state-owned CGN, to keep the project off the government’s books. Taking a stake would have posed its own risks because of delays to projects with the same reactor design in Finland and France, the NAO admitted. “But our analysis suggests alternative approaches could have reduced the total project cost,” it added. If the government had taken a 50% equity stake in the construction it could have almost halved the guarantee power price to as low as £48.50 per megawatt hour, according to the NAO. The auditors were critical of ministers’ decision to negotiate bilaterally with EDF, rather than waiting for other new-build nuclear consortia to compete – an approach that the NAO noted had brought prices down on similar subsidy deals for windfarms. The government’s case for the contract also weakened after the commercial terms of the deal were agreed by the then prime minister, David Cameron, in 2013, the watchdog said. Delays to Hinkley and falling wholesale prices, caused by a two-year oil price slump, meant the total costs to consumers for the 35-year deal ballooned from £6bn in 2013 to £30bn now. That number may rise even higher after new figures on power price expectations are released by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) next month. Brexit could make matters worse still, the spending watchdog warned. In January, the government said it would quit a nuclear cooperation treaty as part of the process of leaving the EU. That withdrawal from Euratom, the NAO said, “might be interpreted as a change of law” resulting in an adjustment of the £92.50 price promised to EDF, or even trigger a one-off payment for EDF through a compensation clause in the contract. While the NAO concluded “it will not be known for decades whether Hinkley Point C will be value for money”, the usually conservative watchdog was strongly critical of the government for not assessing alternative finance models. However, it said the report should not be taken as a recommendation that the government takes a stake in future nuclear projects – but the idea should be explored. Such an approach has been discussed by the Japanese and UK governments for a Japanese-backed plant in Wales. Unions, industry experts and green groups said the report showed lessons must be learned for any future nuclear subsidy deals. Commentators also raised questions over whether Hinkley would look cheap compared with alternatives such as wind and solar, which the government had argued would cost more. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, which represents nuclear workers, said: “This is a deeply worrying report that highlights the lack of accountability and leadership in British nuclear policy.” Dr Robert Gross of Imperial College called the report a “strong reprimand” of the past two governments. A “slavish devotion” to free markets that ruled out taking a stake and failure to wait for other nuclear projects to bring competition were to blame, he said. “Renewables will become cheap, and this was not anticipated at all. It now looks likely that by the time it is built Hinkley will seem expensive compared to new solar and wind projects.” Nina Schrank, energy campaigner at Greenpeace UK, called the report a damning indictment of the government’s agreement. “This year’s school leavers will still be paying for Hinkley when they approach their pension age, so it is concerning that the National Audit Office is suggesting it may not be worth their money,” she said. Jim Skea, president of the Energy Institute, which represents energy professionals, said the report held “clear messages on the steps needed to protect consumers and taxpayers in the future, including possibly radical changes to nuclear policy”. An EDF spokesman said: “Today’s report shows that Hinkley Point C remains good value for consumers compared with alternative choices. Consumers won’t pay a penny until the power station is operating and it is EDF Energy and CGN who will take the risk and responsibility of delivering it.” A BEIS spokesman said: “Hinkley Point C will be the first new nuclear plant in a generation. This was an important strategic decision to ensure that nuclear is part of a diverse energy mix. “Consumers won’t pay a penny until Hinkley is built; it will provide clean, reliable electricity powering homes and creating more than 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships in the process.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-13T13:15:30Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C may cost £30bn in 'top-up payments', warns watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/13/hinkley-point-c-cost-30bn-top-up-payments-nao-report","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C may cost £30bn in 'top-up payments', warns watchdog","bodyText":"A government spending watchdog has launched a devastating critique of Hinkley Point C, warning that the nuclear project could cost energy consumers £30bn in “top-up payments” due to falling wholesale power prices. The National Audit Office (NAO) also expressed fears that taxpayers could end up with a range of other payments under debt guarantees agreed by the government with EDF, the French energy group wanting to develop Hinkley. There could also be potential liabilities for disposing of spent fuel and meeting claims in the event of a nuclear accident, argues the NAO, which says renewables may be a cheaper option. “Supporting early new nuclear projects could lead to higher costs in the short term than continuing to support wind and solar. The cost competitiveness of nuclear power is weakening as wind and solar become more established,” according to the report, titled Nuclear Power in the UK. “The decision to proceed with support for nuclear power therefore relies more on strategic than financial grounds: nuclear power is needed in the supply mix to complement the intermittent nature of wind and solar,” it added. The damaging review comes less than a week after an Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA) assessment published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) put the potential cost of Hinkley at £37bn. The proposed scheme in Somerset to build two reactors capable of providing 7% of Britain’s total electricity needs has also been hit by continual delays due to concerns inside EDF about the financial burden to an already heavily indebted energy company. The nominal cost of construction is £18bn, according to EDF. John Sauven, director of Greenpeace UK, said Theresa May should kill off Hinkley as soon as possible. “The government’s line that Hinkley is a good deal for billpayers is falling apart. Today’s damaging report from the NAO should kill this myth once and for all. It makes the government’s slash and burn approach towards help for homegrown renewable energy companies look completely out of step with reality. Unlike nuclear the cost of renewables is falling every year. “EDF and the Chinese nuclear state owned companies will reap the rewards of the UK government’s generosity while renewable companies are going bust due to lack of government support. The new Prime Minister should put a stop to this disastrous Hinkley deal as one of her first acts as leader. “In the UK, Brexit is throwing up endless questions over the future of the European energy market. It would be idiocy of the highest magnitude for the UK government to sign this disastrous deal.” The most damaging assessment is the NAO analysis, using figures from the Decc, that shows top-up payments under a “contracts for difference” (CFD) subsidy scheme have quadrupled in three years since a deal was struck with EDF by the UK government. “We estimate that the value of future top-up payments under the proposed HPC [Hinkley Point C] CFD have increased from £6.1bn in October 2013 when the strike price was agreed, to £29.7bn in March 2016,” says the report. Under the terms of the subsidy scheme, the British consumer must compensate EDF for lower wholesale electricity prices, and that arrangement looks increasingly bad for the consumer as energy values have plummeted in recent years largely due to a fall in the cost of fossil fuels. Decc argued that the £37bn figure from the IPA was provisional and insisted bill payers would not pay more. It said the latest figure of £30bn from the NAO is based on power prices continuing to fall for the full 35 years of the subsidy scheme which it believes is highly unlikely. “Nuclear is not just a nice-to-have. It is an essential part of our plan for a 21st century energy system that will power homes and businesses with reliable, low carbon electricity,” the Decc said. “Hinkley will generate enough low carbon electricity to power 6m homes and around £10 from consumer bills will pay for it once it is up and running.” The potential costs of waste mentioned by the NAO should be balanced against the fact that this would be the first nuclear plant built in this country where the cost of the clean-up is essentially born by the developer. EDF dismissed the NAO’s gloomy assessment on Hinkley. “Short-term changes in today’s wholesale energy prices do not change the long-term case for Hinkley Point C,” it said. “It will produce electricity in the 2020s and beyond, helping the UK replace older polluting plants with reliable low carbon electricity available even when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. Its cost will be competitive with other forms of low carbon generation and consumers won’t pay a penny until the plant begins operating.” Meanwhile a French parliamentary report concluded that despite the risks of the project, Hinkley was a manageable risk and cost to EDF. The French company has promised to take a final investment decision in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jan/26/jamie-reed-ex-labour-mp-turned-down-offer-defect-tories-conservative-party","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-26T09:48:41Z","webTitle":"Ex-Labour MP Jamie Reed 'turned down offer to defect to Tories'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/26/jamie-reed-ex-labour-mp-turned-down-offer-defect-tories-conservative-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jan/26/jamie-reed-ex-labour-mp-turned-down-offer-defect-tories-conservative-party","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Labour MP Jamie Reed 'turned down offer to defect to Tories'","bodyText":"The former Labour MP Jamie Reed has revealed he turned down an offer to defect to the Conservative party, after being promised a job as a Treasury minister. Reed, who quit as the MP for Copeland in December to take a job at the Sellafield nuclear plant, said he was shocked by the offer made over dinner with two Tory politicians last April. A vocal critic of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, Reed said he could never have been tempted to cross the floor. In an article for the House magazine, he said: “Labour is the greatest and most effective vehicle for economic and social progress our country has ever seen. “You don’t have to sympathise with Labour politics to accept this as a fact and so being asked to cross the floor to become a Tory MP was one of the strangest episodes of my parliamentary career.” Reed, who declined to name the politicians who made the offer, described them as “Tory grandees – both good men, generous to a fault (they paid)”. He went on: “I was flattered to learn of my outstanding qualities, delighted to hear of how much the country needed men like me, and how it would be nothing short of a national catastrophe should I not deploy my considerable talents on the Treasury benches. “There are plenty of Tory MPs with whom I am on friendly terms. For fear of embarrassing them, they will remain nameless. Yet my response to this approach was primeval and immediate. ‘Well … gentlemen … I’m genuinely happy to learn that you hold me in such high regard … but can you imagine my embarrassment?’ We skipped dessert.” Labour faces a tough byelection challenge from the Conservatives in Copeland on 23 February. It will coincide with a similarly challenging poll to defend the Labour seat in Stoke Central, where Ukip’s leader Paul Nuttall is contesting. Labour’s Copeland majority was cut to 2,564 at the last general election and the Conservatives have high hopes of taking the seat given Corbyn’s historic opposition to nuclear power. Stoke and Copeland also registered a majority leave vote in the EU referendum. On Wednesday night it was announced that the Conservatives had selected Trudy Harrison to fight the Copeland byelection, while Jack Brereton, a 25-year-old councillor, will contest the Stoke-on-Trent Central seat for the party. Harrison, 40, said: “This important byelection is an opportunity for the people of Copeland to send a message that the referendum result must be respected. Copeland has had Labour MPs and Labour councils for years. They have ignored us and failed to deliver the jobs, infrastructure and services we need, and now they want to ignore how we voted in the referendum. “I look forward to meeting as many local residents as possible in the coming weeks and setting out how voting Conservative this time will support our local nuclear industry and deliver the investment Copeland deserves.” Labour also announced its candidate for Stoke, the local councillor Gareth Snell. Gillian Troughton, an ambulance driver and former doctor, was chosen last week to contest the Copeland seat for Labour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/22/uk-nuclear-power-generator-monitors-situation-hacking-south-korean-operator","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-22T19:13:53Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power generator ‘monitors situation’ after South Korea hack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/uk-nuclear-power-generator-monitors-situation-hacking-south-korean-operator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/22/uk-nuclear-power-generator-monitors-situation-hacking-south-korean-operator","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear power generator ‘monitors situation’ after South Korea hack","bodyText":"Britain’s largest generator of nuclear power said it would be looking at the hacking of a South Korean nuclear operator to see if any lessons could be learned - but the UK industry emphasised that its security standards are high and that it is well-equipped to withstand a cyber-attack. A spokeswoman for EDF Energy, which owns eight out of the nine nuclear power stations in the UK, said it took nuclear safety and security very seriously. “This extends to our stance around cyber-security and while it is not appropriate to go into detail, we work very closely with our regulator and other agencies to ensure that we have appropriate, ‘in depth’ protection measures in place to safeguard information” she said. “Changes in threats to the UK and our industry in particular are kept under constant review and take into consideration recent cyber-events and changes in cyber-threats. “We are monitoring the situation in South Korea and will take any lessons learned from this into account.” The Office of Nuclear Regulation, has in place strict security regulations, requiring sites to have a security plan, which must include details of “the protection of computer-based systems important to safety and security (known as CBSIS)”. A 2012 ONR security review said computer systems must be protected “against cyber-attack, manipulation, falsification and sabotage, consistent with the threats identified in national threat assessments”. Patricia Lewis, research director in international security at Chatham House, said concern was reasonable, even though people were thinking about security “The key thing with all of this stuff is never think you’re invulnerable,” she said. “Always be aware of your vulnerability and put things in place so you can be prepared for an attack. Always be aware that someone unusual that happens could be the result of a cyber-attack.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2017/jun/19/tommy-cash-surreal-post-soviet-rap-sensation","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-19T11:12:48Z","webTitle":"'Is this for real?'

Meet Tommy Cash, the surreal, post-Soviet rap sensation","bodyText":"There are many strange things about Estonian rapper Tommy Cash. In his early press shots, the 25-year-old is seen riding through a McDonald’s drive-through on a horse. He often performs in a white, floor-length fur coat or a Kurt Cobainesque floral dress with big, black boots. Over the past three years, he has fashioned a reputation for creating an idiosyncratic form of music, which he calls post-Soviet rap, and surreal videos to complement it. There are numerous “reaction” videos to his unsettling visuals on YouTube, responses mainly veering from shock to disgust. “I like to make things I’ve never seen before,” he tells me, giggling. Cash has become a sensation on stage, too: his wild, ecstatic gigs have garnered him a cult following in eastern Europe and in Russia’s witch house rave scene. You need only search his name on Instagram to find floods of diehard fans tattooed with “€$¥”, in reference to the way Cash sometimes spells his name (Tomm¥ €a$h) and to one of his early hits, Euroz Dollarz Yeniz. Alongside Moscow rave group Little Big – with whom he collaborates frequently – he is part of a surge of eastern European artists gaining huge fan bases by dealing in the extreme and the absurd, but in a fashionable, absorbing way. If Cash’s lyrics are to be believed, he started life in a laboratory in Kazakhstan, after a scientist mixed semen and chemical waste. In truth, he grew up in a poor, predominantly Russian neighbourhood on the edge of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. “I call it the Detroit side of town, because it’s dead,” he tells me, his dark hair set in curtains that hang down his forehead, his pencil-thin moustache split in the middle so it looks like extra eyebrows, his cracked front tooth revealing a gap the shape of Portugal. “It was all tiny, rotting wooden houses and there was always a bad smell on the street. I swear I could spot a junkie from a kilometre and tell you exactly what drug he was on.” Cash and his friends didn’t go into the city much; he attended his first party when he was 22. Instead, they would hang around their neighbourhood, making street art, spending as little money as possible and smoking weed. He first discovered rap after signing up for freestyle dance classes after school. “I had this very cool-ass dance teacher called John,” he says. “He was the only guy in Tallinn rocking all the fresh steez from America that our guys didn’t have. He inspired me a lot. He taught me to think with my own head and find my own style.” Today, Cash is in London, recording his debut album. Defining his sound is difficult, mainly because he has veered wildly from trap to bass to hi-NRG eurodance. One song even sampled Enya’s Only Time. His early songs were satire-heavy, had titles like ProRapSuperstar and drew on eastern European stereotypes for comic effect. However, in the past 18 months, he has hit a groove on trap banger Winaloto and industrial slow jam Surf, which shows there is a real artist at play beneath the clips of him lying across car bonnets and being showered in euros. A lowbrow humour permeates his lyrics, which thrive on sexual euphemisms, references to drugs and bog-standard angst – a bleak awfulness that, in his hands, sounds fantastic and is often funny. (One song opens with the line: “Why have abs when you can have kebabs?”) His songs have a cartoon darkness to them, like if Riff Raff dropped a verse on a Marilyn Manson song. The video for Winaloto is particularly startling: the self-directed creation is a buffet of anatomy: bongos made of bums, forests of feet, an undulating ocean of torsos, faces where crotches should be, a man who can twist his limbs 360 degrees, even some conjoined twins. When brainstorming the visuals for his latest single, the extremely sexual Surf, he decided to experiment with subjecting himself to a strict period of total sexual abstinence to see how it affected his output. As the weeks turned into months, he began to see sex everywhere: in the way someone moved their hands or drank their coffee; in the rumbling vibrations of a passing train; in the shape of a cooling tower at a nuclear power station. The resulting video is a series of innocent everyday scenes and objects, seen through the eyes of a sex-starved Cash, whose testicles (in the video, at least) have swollen to the size of cantaloupes. “I hate confusing art; I just want people to understand exactly what I mean,” he says when I ask about a scene in which an enormous hand gently uncoils a condom over a residential tower block. “I think, because I have an accent and because of the shock elements in my videos, people think I’m like Die Antwoord,” he says. “But all that comes from my passion for [film-maker] Alejandro Jodorowsky.” In truth, Cash has a lot in common with contemporaries such as Lil Peep and Yung Lean – artists with a preternatural understanding of how art works in a hyper-connected digital world. They operate between sincerity and satire, stupidity and cleverness, because they know that, in a world where people consume content at a gluttonous rate, you need to do more than simply satisfy someone – you need to confuse, bewilder and leave a puff of smoke. There is a reason that one of the most popular comments beneath Cash’s videos is along the lines of: “Is this for real?” “I think people will stop comparing me to them when they see my newer work,” says Cash, glancing at the scribbles on the notepad next to him, as if he has a master plan. “As Marina Abramović said: a good artist has one great idea; a genius has two.” Tommy Cash performs the Blues stage at Glastonbury on 23 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/28/uk-electricity-france-brexit-channel","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-01T08:49:18Z","webTitle":"All it took was an anchor … how a storm took down half the UK's electricity link to France","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/uk-electricity-france-brexit-channel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/28/uk-electricity-france-brexit-channel","fields":{"headline":"All it took was an anchor … how a storm took down half the UK's electricity link to France","bodyText":"As the waves in the Channel roiled and winds gusted at 80mph during Storm Angus last year, managers at the National Grid noticed something they’d never seen before. Half of the power link between the UK and France, a series of 43-mile-long cables running between Folkestone in Kent to a site near Calais, had suddenly gone down. The incident seems to have been the unintentional side-effect of an even more dramatic one above the waters, as huge cargo ship Saga Sky collided with a barge carrying rocks. Although the four pairs of cables that make up the Interconnexion France Angleterre (IFA) are marked on maps, one of the vessels appears to have urgently dropped anchor as it was tossed around in the storm. The anchor hit a French pair of cables and then bounced over a British pair before crashing into another French pair, the Guardian understands. Despite being armoured and underneath the seabed, both were damaged and taken offline. Repairs mean that this week the capacity of the IFA has gone from 1GW in the aftermath of Angus to 1.5GW, and should be back to its full 2GW by 15 March. French grid operator RTE said it had borne the £30m to £40m cost of repairs. “Repair works are ongoing and progressing well on the remaining two cables, despite adverse weather conditions,” a spokesman for National Grid added. Under the contract drawn up when the link was laid in the 1980s, National Grid did not have to contribute to the repairs because only the French cables were affected. The return to full operation will be a relief to grid operators on both sides of the Channel. The link typically supplies about 5% of the UK’s electricity and brings a degree of flexibility to the energy system that helps keep the lights on and stop power prices shooting up too much. Most of the time, electricity flows from France to the UK. But for the last three months of 2016, there was the novelty of the UK being a net exporter, as France experienced nuclear outages. “We are starting to see the benefits of a two-way link, of meeting peak demands when there is insufficient domestic generation available on both sides,” said Steven Moore, chief executive of Eleclink, the Eurotunnel-owned company building a new 1GW link through the Channel tunnel. Last Friday, ministers attended the launch of the construction phase of the €580m (£495m) interconnector, scheduled for completion in 2019 and ready for commercial use in 2020, to carry atomic power from France to the UK – and an increasing amount of wind power in the other direction. “This is a very, very important project for the improved security of both countries’ energy supply when we need it the most. 2020 has always been seen as a potential capacity pinchpoint, when you consider all the coal power stations are due to be closed by 2025, and Hinkley [a new nuclear power station] is not going to be on at the earliest until 2025,” said Moore. Eleclink is one of several new interconnectors planned to help the UK avoid a shortfall in power capacity. National Grid, which sees them as a growth business, is already blasting through rock in Norway to connect the country’s hydro dams with the UK through a 450-mile-long, 1.4GW capacity cable to the UK. Despite the threat of changes to the way electricity is traded across borders post-Brexit, the company is considering more connections with Europe as it believes the fundamental case for them will not be affected by the UK leaving the EU. Another interconnector, linking Scotland’s Aberdeenshire coast and Norway, was last week awarded €10m of EU funding. NorthConnect is a jointly owned by Swedish utility Vattenfall and three Norwegian utilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/31/a-siege-a-bomb-48-dogs-and-the-black-commune-that-would-not-surrender","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-31T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"A siege.

An African American man, his hair in dreadlocks, chest bare, stands with arms outstretched as though emulating Jesus on the cross. A white police officer is jabbing a shotgun at him with the muzzle inches from his throat. Another officer clasps a police helmet in his right hand as if preparing to whack him over the head with it. Forty years almost to the day after that photo was taken, the same black man described how he came to be standing there on a sidewalk, half-naked and surrounded by angry police. His account was almost too graphic to grasp, sounding more like something out of a movie than the recollection of what really happened in the heart of one of America’s major cities. It was 8 August 1978 and he had just emerged from the basement of the house in Philadelphia that his black revolutionary group, Move, used as a communal home. In an attempt to evict them from the property, hundreds of officers had just stormed the building, pummeling it with water cannons and gunfire, and in the maelstrom a police officer had been killed and several other first responders injured. “As I emerged from the basement I had the presence of mind to let them see I was unarmed, so I took my shirt off,” the black man said. “That’s when I put my arms out wide.” The black man is Delbert Orr Africa, Del for short. When I went to meet him he was wearing a burgundy one-piece with a white T-shirt and blue shoes. Everyone else around him was wearing the same uniform of Dallas maximum-security prison in Pennsylvania that he has worn every day since appearing in that photograph 40 years ago. I had come to interview him as part of a two-year project in which I made contact with eight black liberationists who have all experienced long prison sentences. They each agreed to embark on an ongoing conversation with me about their political beliefs today and their battle to secure their own freedom. Del Africa, 72, and I talked for three hours in the prison visitors’ room. He spoke rapidly and intensely, as though he needed to get it all out, relating how he had joined the Black Panther party in Chicago and then switched to the Move organisation after relocating to Philadelphia. He also told me what happened the second after that photo was taken, as though he were narrating the next few frames of a news reel. As it turns out, that police officer really had been about to whack him. “A cop hit me with his helmet,” he said. “Smashed my eye. Another cop swung his shotgun and broke my jaw. I went down, and after that I don’t remember anything ’til I came to and a dude was dragging me by my hair and cops started kicking me in the head.” * * * Del Africa is one of the Move 9, the group of five men and four women, all African American, who were arrested 40 years ago this August during the 1978 police siege of their headquarters in Powelton Village, Philadelphia. They were charged as a nine-person unit with the murder of the police officer who died in the melee, James Ramp. Each was sentenced to 30 years to life, though to this day they protest their innocence. The ranks of the Move 9 have slowly been depleted over the years. Two have died in prison. In June, the first of the nine to win parole, Debbie Africa, was released from a Pennsylvania women’s prison. As the 40th anniversary approaches, six of the Move 9 are still behind bars, Del Africa included. They are among a total of 19 black radicals who remain locked up in penitentiaries across America having been convicted of violent acts committed in the name of black power between the late 1960s and early 1980s. Along with former Black Panthers and Black Liberation Army members, they amount to the unfinished business of the black liberation struggle. Many of them remain strikingly passionate about the cause, even as they strive for release in some cases half a century into their sentences. In the case of Move members, their politics are a strange fusion of black power and flower power. The group that formed in the early 1970s melded the revolutionary ideology of the Black Panthers with the nature- and animal-loving communalism of 1960s hippies. You might characterise them as black liberationists-cum-eco warriors. That sense of passion for the cause leaps out from the first email that Del Africa sent to me from Dallas in September 2016, after I’d contacted him asking to talk. “ON THE MOVE! LONG LIVE FREEDOM’S STRUGGLE!” he proclaimed in capital letters at the top of the message. “Warm Revolutionary greetings, Ed!” He then launched into a long deliberation about the “plight of political prisoners here in ameriKKKa!”. Move members are still imprisoned, he wrote, “just because we steadfastly refused to abandon our Belief in the Revolutionary Teachings of Move’s Founder” and because of “our refusal to bow down to this murderous, racist, sexist rotten-ass system”. He ended with the quip: “But, hey, I don’t wanna burn you out the first time I reply to your email.” There was a similar robustness to the first response I received in December 2016 after reaching out to Janine Phillips Africa, one of the four women among the Move 9. Unlike Del Africa’s email, she wrote to me by hand, sending the letter by mail as she has continued to do over the ensuing 18 months. “Me and my sisters are doing good, staying strong,” was the first sentence she wrote to me. That was remarkable in itself coming from a woman who is not only approaching the 40th anniversary of her incarceration but has had two of her children killed in confrontations with police. “Everybody knows how strong Move men are. We’re showing the world how strong Move women are. That’s how it’s been since our arrest in 1978,” she said. * * * In the course of that first letter, Janine Africa, who was 22 when she was arrested and is now 62, took me deep into the “torture chamber”, the cruel solitary confinement wing where she spent the first three years of her sentence. “There were no windows, just a section of the wall with frosted panes. You couldn’t tell when it was night or day, they kept the lights on 24/7. They were ordered to break us but it didn’t work – no matter what they did, they were not going to break us.” Over the months, I came to learn about the double tragedy in Janine Africa’s life. In 1976, Philadelphia police officers turned up at the Move house in Powelton Village having been called out to a disturbance. Scuffling ensued between some Move residents and police. Janine was shoved and her baby, whom she had named Life, was knocked out of her arms to the ground. His skull appears to have been crushed, and he died later that day in her arms. He was three weeks old. Then on 13 May 1985, seven years after Janine Africa was imprisoned, she received further terrible news. Philadelphia police had dropped a bomb from a helicopter onto a Move house on Osage Avenue in the west of Philadelphia in an attempt to force the black radicals to evacuate the premises after long-running battles with the authorities. The bomb ignited a fire in the Move house that turned into an inferno. Janine’s 12-year-old son, Little Phil, was being cared for in that house by other Move adults while she was in custody. The then mayor of Philadelphia, Wilson Goode, notoriously gave the go-ahead for the bombing, and the fire that ensued was allowed to rage, the blaze spreading across the black neighborhood and razing 61 homes to the ground. Little Phil and four other children burned to death. So too did six adults including Move’s founder, John Africa, AKA Vincent Leaphart. I asked Janine Africa how she coped with losing two young sons during clashes with law enforcement. She was reticent. “I don’t like talking about the night Life was killed,” she wrote in April. “There are times when I think about Life and my son Phil, but I don’t keep those thoughts in my mind long because they hurt.” In that same letter she said she had turned grief into what she contests is a force for good: deeper commitment to the struggle. “The murder of my children, my family, will always affect me, but not in a bad way. When I think about what this system has done to me and my family, it makes me even more committed to my belief,” she said. Del Africa also heard bad news on 13 May 1985. His 13-year-old daughter Delisha was also living in the Move house. She too died in the fire. When I asked him how he dealt with being told his daughter had been killed in an inferno that had been ignited by the actions of the city authorities, he wasn’t as sanguine as Janine. “I just cried,” he said during my prison visit. “I wanted to strike out. I wanted to wreak as much havoc as I could until they put me down. That anger, it brought such a feeling of helplessness. Like, dang! What to do now? Dark times …” Mayor Goode made a formal apology for the disaster the following year. But a grand jury cleared all officials of criminal liability for the 1985 bombing that killed 11 people, including five children. The only adult Move member to escape the inferno alive, Ramona Africa, was imprisoned for seven years. * * * All Move members take the last name “Africa” to denote their commitment to race equality and their strong bond to what they regard as their Move “family”. “A family of revolutionaries” is how Del Africa once described it to me. Unlike the Black Panther party which formally dissolved in 1982, Move is still a living entity. “We exposed the crimes of government officials on every level,” Janine Africa wrote to me. “We demonstrated against puppy mills, zoos, circuses, any form of enslavement of animals. We demonstrated against Three Mile Island [nuclear power plant] and industrial pollution. We demonstrated against police brutality. And we did so uncompromisingly. Slavery never ended, it was just disguised.” Deeply committed as they were to each other, the Move “family” undoubtedly had the ability to incense those around them. They liked to project their revolutionary message at high volume from a bullhorn at all hours of night and day. Passersby were accosted with a torrent of expletives. Then there were the dogs. When the 1978 siege happened, there were 12 adults and 11 children in the Move house in Powelton Village – and 48 dogs. Most of the animals were strays taken in by the group as part of its philosophy of caring for the vulnerable. Black liberation, animal liberation – the two are as one with Move. John Africa was known as the “dog man”, as he was rarely seen without one. The unconventional nature of the Move community which drove some neighbors to despair in turn led to demands for their eviction, and ultimately to the fatal siege. Over time relations grew more belligerent. Months before the siege Move members made visible their threat to resist attempts to remove them from the neighborhood – they stood on a platform they had built at the front of the house dressed in fatigues and brandishing rifles. On its side, the city was led at that time by the Frank Rizzo, Goode’s predecessor as Philadelphia mayor, a former police commissioner who liked to talk tough and was fond of dog-whistle politics. He once said of the Move radicals: “You are dealing with criminals, barbarians, you are safer in the jungle!” Another Rizzo classic was: “Break their heads is right. They try to break yours, you break theirs first.” When Move refused to vacate the premises having been issued with an eviction order, Rizzo said he would impose a blockade on the house so tight “even a fly wouldn’t get in”. He was not kidding. For 56 days before the siege, a ring of steel was erected around the house, no food was permitted into the compound and the water supply was cut off. Rizzo bragged he would “show them more firepower than they’ve ever seen”. At about 6am on 8 August 1978 the action started. Move members were battered by water cannon as they took refuge in the basement of the building. Tear gas was propelled into the house. At 8.15am shots rang out and a thunderstorm of gunfire erupted that is captured on police footage of the incident. Police and fire officers are seen scattering in all directions as bullets whistle overhead seemingly in all directions. It looked like a war zone. Soon after Move adults and naked children began emerging from the smoke-ridden basement. Janine Africa can be heard in the police footage screaming. Next, Del Africa appears, his hands outstretched in that Jesus pose. The camera pans in on him as he lies on the street after he was hit with the police helmet. Two police officers begin kicking him on his head which bounces between them like a ball. Three officers later faced disciplinary measures but a judge dismissed the charges. Prosecutors accused the Move 9 of collaboratively killing Ramp, even though he died from one bullet. They said the shooting had been started when gunfire erupted from the basement where the Move members were gathered, a theory supported by some eyewitnesses. Move’s attorney gathered other witness evidence suggesting the fatal shot had come from the opposite direction – in other words, it was accidental “friendly fire”. At trial no forensic evidence was presented that connected the Move 9 to the weapon that caused the fatality. For the women in particular the prosecution did not even argue the four had handled firearms or had been involved in the actual shooting of Ramp. Del Africa insisted when I interviewed him that though Move had guns in the house, none of them were operative. “There was no shooting from our side,” he told me. “No one in the house had any gunshot residue, none of us had fingerprints on any of the weapons they claim came out of the house.” The Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police has a plaque for Ramp on its memorial site. I reached out to the order many times in the course of a month to hear their reflection on his death and Move’s role in it, but they did not respond. You can get a sense of the depth of feeling by reading the comments under Ramp’s page on the Philadelphia Officer Down Memorial website. Several commentators, some of whom vividly recalled the 1978 siege, sent blessings to the deceased police officer and his family. Others expressed anger at the lack of justice for Ramp, though they didn’t specify what they meant. One woman, whose late husband was on duty at both the siege and the 1985 bombing, was more direct. She said of Ramp: “I was so sad to hear of your passing. I felt, and still do feel so badly for your family. Move were scum and cowards, hiding as they shot. You were SO brave. Never forgotten. RIP.” * * * As they approach the 40th anniversary of the siege and of their subsequent captivity, Del and Janine Africa described to me how they’ve coped for so long doing time for a crime they insist they did not commit. They each have their own survival methods. Janine Africa told me she avoids thinking about time itself. Birthdays, holidays, the new year mean nothing to her. “The years are not my focus, I keep my mind on my health and the things I need to do day by day.” Del Africa thinks of the eons behind bars not as “prison time” but as “revolutionary prison activity”. “I keep saying to myself: ‘I will not fall apart. I will not give in.’” They’ve both experienced long stretches in solitary confinement, a brand of punishment that the UN has decried as a form of torture. In 1983, Del Africa was put into the “hole” – an isolation cell – because he refused to have his dreadlocks cut. He stayed in the hole for six years. He relieved the stress and boredom by organizing black history quizzes for other inmates held in the isolation wing. Russell Shoaltz, a former Black Panther, helped him devise the questions, and shout them out down the line of solitary cells. Questions such as: when was the Brown v Board of Education ruling in the US supreme court? What year was the Black Panther party founded? Who was Dred Scott? For what is John Brown remembered? Eventually Del Africa won the right to keep his dreads. When I visited him in Dallas there they hung, salt-and-peppered now, proudly down to his hips. Throughout, the Move prisoners have drawn strength from companionship with other members of the nine. Janine shared a cell with two other surviving Move women – Debbie Africa and Janet Holloway Africa – in Cambridge Springs women’s prison in Pennsylvania. They called each other “sisters” and did everything together. “We read, we play cards, we watch TV. We laugh a lot together, we’re sisters through and through,” she wrote in a letter in February. There was one other member of their gang: fittingly given the history of the organization, a dog called Chevy. The prison authorities let them keep the dog kenneled in their cell as part of a program in which they train the animal for later use as a service dogs for disabled people. Life went on like this for years, and had acquired its own normality, almost a certain tranquility. Until last month when Debbie Africa was granted parole and set free. Her departure came as a jolt. “It’s strange not having Deb here,” Janine said. “I keep expecting her to walk in from work. They snuck her out at 5.00 in the morning. We only got to hug her briefly and watch her leave. Chevy misses her, he keeps sniffing her bed.” In June, Janine and Janet Africa also went before the same parole board as Debbie and made essentially the same case that they had earned their freedom. The board asked Janine whether she would be a risk to the public were she to be let out, and she referred them to her pristine prison record: the last time she had any disciplinary rap was 26 years ago. “The way I’m in here is the way I’ll be outside, there is no risk factor,” she told them. While Debbie was set free, both Janine and Janet had their parole denied. The board said they showed “lack of remorse” for the death of Ramp in the 1978 siege. Janine Africa wrote to me a few days after she learnt of the denial, speculating that games were being played with her mind. The contrast of Debbie’s release with her denial was “either to make us resent Deb or make me feel hopeless and break us down. Whatever their tactic, it isn’t working!” Debbie’s release also made a profound impact on Del Africa. “I feel overjoyed that Debbie is out,” he wrote to me. “Her release is a breakthrough! I see it finally opening the door a crack.” Del Africa also hasn’t had a misconduct report in prison for more than 20 years. Yet he too was turned down for parole last year and must wait another four years before his next chance to convince the parole board that he can safely be returned to society. Like many of the 19 black liberationists still behind bars, Del Africa is caught in a trap attached to the crime for which he was convicted. He knows he will only be paroled if he expresses heartfelt remorse. But says he cannot do that. “How can I have any remorse for something I never did?” he said. “I had nothing to do with killing a cop in 1978. Have they shown any remorse for what happened to my daughter in 1985?” Would he show remorse to the parole board if he felt it would secure his release? “No, never going to do that,” he said. “That would be akin to making them right. They are the ones who were wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/16/greener-alternatives-to-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-16T17:45:20Z","webTitle":"Greener alternatives to Hinkley Point C | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/16/greener-alternatives-to-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/16/greener-alternatives-to-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"Greener alternatives to Hinkley Point C","bodyText":"Simon Jenkins writes that “To question China’s good intentions in financing the power station [at Hinkley Point] is silly. It is a French-built plant, and the idea that Beijing might contrive to embed and then activate some doomsday bug is absurd” (Trade with China is a good thing. But Hinkley Point is a dud, 11 August). Not that absurd. The China General Nuclear Group (CGN), which is involved in financing Hinkley Point, expects to build a new nuclear station with its own reactor at Bradwell in return for its involvement at Hinkley. This was agreed by David Cameron and Xi Jinping last October. The reactor it hopes to build is its small modular reactor Hualong One. CGN has just been indicted by the US authorities for exporting nuclear technology to China without authorisation (Nuclear espionage charge for China firm with one-third stake in UK’s Hinkley Point, theguardian.com, 11 August). The indictment specifically relates to Hualong One and the “verification and validation of nuclear reactor codes”. Computer bugs in nuclear power stations are not science fiction. Israel and the US planted the Stuxnet bug in the nuclear reactor at Bushehr in Iran in 2010. Hualong One would not be allowed in the US. Neither France nor Germany would allow China to build it in their countries. Is the UK really so desperate for Chinese funds to build Hinkley Point that it will allow China a major stake in the provision of electricity in the UK in return? Norman Dombey Professor emeritus of theoretical physics, University of Sussex, and former specialist advisor to the Commons select committee on energy • Simon Jenkins decries the potential deal with China over the Hinkley Point proposed nuclear power station. He argues that project is “reckless and absurdly expensive”, and so it is. But there are other reasons for stopping this project, which many in China will appreciate. China is arguably the world leader in renewable energy, both in manufacturing for the world and in using itself. The intrinsic variability of most renewables (especially wind and solar) is no longer a misfit with the variability of human demand. Ever advancing telecommunications and electronic control systems allow the demand to be adjusted to fit the supply on a scale from household to national. Witness the sophisticated systems widely available for matching electrical loads and energy stores to solar power. Householders already use these; electrical grid operators are trialling methods for widespread integration of solar and wind power with load demand control, energy storage and price adjustment. The last thing such advances need is an untried gigawatt source of constant electricity generation that cannot be matched to demand, that is expensive, and whose waste is harmful and untreatable. There are many in China and France who share these views; ceasing Hinkley will be welcomed by them too. Dr John Twidell Horninghold, Leicestershire • I agree with Simon Jenkins that Hinkley is a dud, for many reasons that have been discussed in his article and elsewhere. However, I am saddened that he appears to dismiss wind, and implicitly all renewable energy sources, as not providing baseload electricity. At the same time that Hinkley has been generally given the red carpet, the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon and further similar projects have potential to produce 8% of our baseload electricity. The tidal lagoon project would last about three times as long as any nuclear power station – about 90 years. The cost of the Swansea lagoon is estimated to be £1bn. So to achieve the full 8% of baseload electricity (more than Hinkley), perhaps about £5bn would be needed to complete four or five similar projects in the UK – less than a third of the Hinkley costs. There is also no nuclear waste to manage for thousands of years. Tidal power flows into the lagoon for six hours, out for six hours and does this twice a day, giving reliable electricity for 24 hours a day. Swansea Bay tidal lagoon is the best alternative to Hinkley, so why is it not getting immediate government support and approval? Why is it not even being discussed? Steve Emsley Newcastle upon Tyne • To make a sound judgment on energy sources British citizens should be given the relevant facts. One such fact is the disaster of Fukushima which has been ongoing for more than five years. Still out of control, the multiple meltdowns are pouring radioactive particles into the atmosphere and radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean. The crown estate is right (Crown estate says future is in wind not Hinkley, 15 August). No lethal pollution emanates from windfarms. Jim McCluskey London • Perhaps Foreign Secretary Johnson might have a word with the Chinese authorities and explain, with his inimitable gift for communication, that the UK has now taken back its sovereignty and can no longer be pushed around (Theresa May seeks close ties with China despite Hinkley Point delay, 10 August).

EDF’s finance director has quit rather than be associated with a project that – we must assume – he judges so financially risky that it could sink the French energy firm. Last week, the official line from the Anglo-French summit maintained that “major progress” was being made in getting Hinkley towards sign-off. The reality, we can now see, is that there has been a major row and EDF remains mired in confusion. The good news is that Thomas Piquemal’s resignation should oblige the governments of France and the UK to acknowledge the uncomfortable fact about Hinkley that, until now, they have preferred to brush away. It’s simple: EDF’s nuclear technology for Hinkley hasn’t been proven to work. Until it can be shown to be reliable, there will always be a material risk that the Somerset project becomes a disaster for both buyer and supplier. EDF is building two other reactors in Europe to the same European pressurised reactor (EPR) design and, instead of low-carbon nuclear power, both have produced only massive cost overruns. The plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule. EDF’s crisis flows from those flops and Piquemal’s analysis that the company can’t afford to double-down on its EPR bet is surely correct. As it is, the debt-laden firm’s share price has fallen 90% over the past decade and there are other calls on its capital and resources, not least France’s nuclear power stations, which require an expensive upgrade. The now ex-finance director wanted the investment decision on Hinkley to be delayed by three years, which would be wise from EDF’s point of view. The trouble is, the UK cannot afford yet more delays. Our crisis in energy generation will arrive in the mid-2020s and Hinkley, according to the official script, was supposed to do much more than merely produce 7% of the UK’s energy. The plant was also intended to help develop the infrastructure to support other companies’ new nuclear plants. If Hinkley were to be delayed by three years, the UK hasn’t got an energy policy worthy of the name. The latest saga should lead to a simple conclusion in Downing Street: EDF and its unreliable EPRs were always the wrong choice for the UK. Consider how many subsidies have already been promised to compensate for EDF’s weaknesses and the unproven nature of its EPR. EDF was given 10 years to build Hinkley and the UK guaranteed to buy its output at twice the current wholesale price for 35 years in an inflation-linked contract. This was almost case of pricing in the cost over-runs and delays before they had even happened, with UK consumers footing the bill. The best approach now would be to call the whole thing off. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy may continue to whistle cheerfully about Hinkley but his company looks to be only one more resignation away from capitulation. Abandonment would be politically embarrassing for chancellor George Osborne (remember last year’s grovel for Chinese cash to shore up the financing) but it would be far worse to let this show drag on. If the UK’s future is nuclear, there are alternative suppliers – from Japan, the US, and China – who have smaller models that can be built more quickly, but their willingness to commit capital won’t be encouraged by the sight of the current Hinkley shambles. If the future is non-nuclear, then get on with the job of making hard choices about the best infrastructure. Either way, the important thing for the UK is to have an energy policy that doesn’t rely on paying top-dollar to an over-stretched supplier that hasn’t been able to get its new kit to work. Banking reforms look set to disappoint The Competition and Markets Authority’s final report into the banking industry, due in May, will now appear in the dog days of August. This is not because the contents will be so frightening that leading bankers will need to lie down on the nearest beach. We already know the CMA has rejected structural reforms, such as a break-up of the big banks, in favour of technocratic fiddles, such as setting up a comparison website to encourage punters to shop around. Such a remedy was damned as feeble by most observers when it was announced at the interim stage last October. That, presumably, is why the CMA has given itself an extension to come up with something that sounds more chunky. Caps on overdraft charges and grace periods for customers to avoid the same charges may improve the lot of a few. But none of these late additions by the CMA will deliver a shot in the arm for competition in the banking industry. Blame Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has turned the process of separating 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches into something resembling the labours of Hercules, thereby killing all appetite for further structural reform. Thus the “striking” stability in market shares identified by the CMA is virtually guaranteed to be striking in another decade’s time. The interim report felt like a missed opportunity; prepare to be disappointed again. SNP donor in tax pickle Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish first minister and leader of Scottish National party, is a fierce opponent of the artificial tax tactics of some major companies. So, here you would think, is an open goal – a court defeat for a Scottish company that used a complex scheme to wipe £11m off its tax bill. The company is Stagecoach, whose chairman, Sir Brian Souter, happens to have been a major donor to the SNP. Sturgeon’s condemnation, one trusts, will be forthcoming anyway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/24/stoke-copeland-labour-remain-richmond-copeland-ukip","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T07:45:08Z","webTitle":"Remain voters must now be Labour’s top priority – Stoke and Copeland prove it | John Curtice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/stoke-copeland-labour-remain-richmond-copeland-ukip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/stoke-copeland-labour-remain-richmond-copeland-ukip","fields":{"headline":"Remain voters must now be Labour’s top priority – Stoke and Copeland prove it","bodyText":"Byelection nights are typically a source of succour for the opposition. Its vote usually goes up while the government almost invariably suffers some kind of reverse. But this pattern was entirely absent in both Copeland and Stoke. In Copeland Tory support increased by no less than 8.5 points – the biggest increase in support for a government party since Harold Wilson’s Labour government won the Hull North byelection in January 1966 (at the cost, incidentally, of a promise to build the Humber Bridge). This swing was enough to deliver the Tories a seat they had not won since 1931. Indeed, never before in the whole history of postwar British byelections has a government overturned so large an opposition majority as Labour was defending in Copeland. Doubtless Labour, whose support fell by five points, will argue that it had its own particular local difficulties in Copeland – the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, used at least to be antipathetic to the nuclear power industry, on which the constituency is heavily dependent. But for his critics, this local difficulty will be regarded as symptomatic of the wider unpopularity of some of his policy stances. Meanwhile, although the contest in Stoke had been widely portrayed as a two-horse race – and thus the third placed Conservative vote was supposedly vulnerable to a squeeze – Conservative support also increased there (by a couple of points) too. While Labour held the seat quite comfortably, its vote still fell by a couple of points. Labour’s share of the vote has now dropped in every single byelection since the Brexit referendum. From leafy Richmond to windswept Copeland the message has been the same : the party is struggling to hang on to the already diminished band of supporters who backed it in 2015. The party’s problems were, of course, in evidence long before 23 June last year. But the vote to leave the EU has exacerbated them. Labour seems to have decided in recent weeks that its first priority is to stave off the threat from Ukip to its traditional working-class vote, much of which supposedly voted to leave in the EU referendum. But in so doing it seems to have forgotten (or not realised) that most of those who voted Labour in 2015 – including those living in Labour seats in the North and the Midlands – backed remain. The party is thus at greater risk of losing votes to the pro-remain Liberal Democrats than to pro-Brexit Ukip. And the Liberal Democrats edged up in both Stoke and Copeland, just as they have done in every byelection since the EU referendum. Ukip itself shares this misapprehension about the importance of the Labour leave vote. Hardly anyone who voted remain is willing to vote for Ukip. Yet it insists on targeting a Labour vote that voted by two to one to remain rather than a Conservative vote where well over half voted to leave. The seeds of Paul Nuttall’s failure to win Stoke, or indeed to register anything more than a two-point increase in the party’s share of the vote, almost undoubtedly lie in his failure to squeeze what will almost undoubtedly have been a predominantly leave-inclined Conservative vote in Stoke. Meanwhile Ukip did see its own vote badly squeezed in Copeland, suffering a drop of nine points, the party’s worst byelection performance yet in this parliament. Most probably it was the advancing Conservatives who primarily benefited – a stark warning to Ukip that Theresa May’s allegedly hard Brexit could enable her to steal the party’s clothes. On 24 June the Conservatives were in turmoil, Now, seven months on they must be wondering whether it was fortunate after all to have lost the EU referendum. For if the whole country were to swing in line with what happened in Copeland and Stoke together, May could secure an overall majority of nearly 100. Perhaps her one regret this weekend is that she has so firmly ruled out trying to hold an early general election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2017/jul/04/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-japans-defence-ministry-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-04T19:47:05Z","webTitle":"North Korea claims successful test of intercontinental ballistic missile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/04/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-japans-defence-ministry-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jul/04/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-japans-defence-ministry-says","fields":{"headline":"North Korea claims successful test of intercontinental ballistic missile","bodyText":"North Korea claims to have conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) , a development that, if confirmed, could move the regime closer to being able to strike the US mainland and dramatically strengthen its hand in negotiations with Washington. South Korean and Japanese officials said they were studying the data to confirm whether or not it was an ICBM, but analysts said it appeared the missile had the range to strike Alaska but not other parts of the continental US. Later there were reports in the US that officials believe North Korea may have fired its first intercontinental missile, though there was no official public statement from the US about this. The launch, which came as Americans prepared to mark Independence Day, triggered a Twitter outburst from President Donald Trump who urged China to act to “end this nonsense once and for all”. In a joint statement released after the missile test, Russia and China condemned the launch and proposed that North Korea declare a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, while at the same time calling on Washington to immediately halt deployment of its THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea. In a rare announcement on state North Korean television, an emotional newsreader said Kim Jong-un had personally overseen the “landmark” test of a Hwasong-14 missile. North Korea was now a “a strong nuclear power state” and had “a very powerful ICBM that can strike any place in the world,” the newsreader said. She added that the missile had reached an altitude of 2,802km (1,741 miles) and flew 933km (580 miles) – longer and higher than any of the regime’s previous similar tests. Those figures roughly concurred with analysis by Japanese and South Korean officials. Early indications were that the missile was a single-stage device. But later, NBC News cited two unnamed US officials saying they now believed it was “two stage”, and CNN quoted one official saying it was a “probable” ICBM and that the ongoing assessment suggested a second-stage booster did ignite and produced additional flight for 30 seconds. While the apparent advancement in North Korea’s missile technology will add to concerns that the regime is moving closer to developing the capacity to strike the US mainland, many analysts still doubt whether it can miniaturise a nuclear weapon sufficiently to fit it on to a missile. They also believe the regime is unlikely to have mastered the technology needed for an ICBM to survive re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. South Korea’s military confirmed that North Korea had fired an “unidentified ballistic missile” into the Sea of Japan – known in North Korea as the East Sea of Korea – from Banghyon in North Pyongan, a province near its border with China. The timing of North Korea’s 11th launch this year – on the eve of the US Independence Day holiday and just before the start of the G20 summit in Hamburg – was significant. It came soon after Donald Trump met the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, in Washington, and held telephone discussions dominated by Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons programmes with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The missile landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, the South Korean military and Japanese government said. Tokyo strongly protested against what it called a clear violation of UN resolutions banning Pyongyang from developing ballistic missile technology. The US Pacific Command said it detected and tracked the “single launch of a land-based, intermediate-range ballistic missile” for 37 minutes near an airfield in Panghyon, about 60 miles north-west of Pyongyang - a flight time longer than any similar previous tests. The joint statement from Russia and China, issued shortly after President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping held wide-ranging talks in the Kremlin, called on North Korea, South Korea and the United States to sign up to a Chinese de-escalation plan designed to defuse tensions around Pyongyang’s missile programme. The plan would see North Korea suspend its ballistic missile programme and the United States and South Korea simultaneously call a moratorium on large-scale missile exercises, both moves aimed at paving the way for multilateral talks. “The situation in the region affects the national interests of both countries,” the joint statement said. “Russia and China will work in close coordination to advance a solution to the complex problem of the Korean Peninsula in every possible way.” The joint declaration also called on Washington to immediately halt deployment of its THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, a move Washington says is necessitated by the North Korean missile threat. The statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the area. On Monday China’s ambassador to the United Nations had warned of “disastrous” consequences if world powers fail to find a way to ease tensions with North Korea that risked getting “out of control”. North Korea has increased the frequency of tests this year as it attempts to develop a missile capable of carrying a miniaturised nuclear warhead as far as the US mainland – a geopolitical game-changer that Trump has vowed “won’t happen”. The regime’s most recent missile test before Tuesday came on 8 June when it launched a new type of cruise missile that Pyongyang said was capable of striking US and South Korean warships “at will”. David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a blogpost the initial assessments of the flight time and distance suggested the missile fired on Tuesday could have a maximum range of roughly 6,700km (4,160 miles). “That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska,” he said. Shea Cotton, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in the US, suggested the launch was deliberately timed to coincide with the anniversary of the US declaration of independence. “It’s already 4th of July in North Korea,” he said on Twitter. “I somewhat suspect they’re shooting off some fireworks today specifically because of that.” South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff immediately briefed Moon. Since taking office on 10 May, Moon has tried to push cautious engagement with Pyongyang, but the regime has continued its missile tests, insisting it has the right to develop a nuclear deterrent to counter what it calls growing military provocations by the US. Trump and Moon agreed to apply “maximum pressure” to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, but agreed they were open to dialogue with the regime “under the right circumstances”. Trump declared the US had run out of patience with North Korea over its weapons programme. “Together, we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea,” he said. “The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/19/chinese-reactor-plan-fuels-british-security-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T18:56:53Z","webTitle":"Chinese reactor plan fuels British security fears | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/chinese-reactor-plan-fuels-british-security-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/19/chinese-reactor-plan-fuels-british-security-fears","fields":{"headline":"Chinese reactor plan fuels British security fears","bodyText":"A lesson learned from the otherwise successful UK gas-cooled reactor programmes was that excessive diversity of design prevents economies of scale during construction and is inefficient during the plant’s working life. A Chinese reactor at Bradwell would be the fourth different new power reactor design in England. Commercial and security issues may be soluble at nominal cost. But can the UK muster sufficient indigenous expertise to master the details of the technology and design of so many types in order to become an expert customer and subsequently operate the reactors safely and economically for their expected life? Even if the necessary expertise and industrial capacity were available it would represent a continuing cost throughout the life of the reactor and well into subsequent decommissioning. Some careful strategic thinking is needed before the government enters into an agreement with China in addition to current plans for Hinkley Point, Wylfa and Moorside. Tim Chittenden Workington, Cumbria • A few more questions for George Osborne about his French/Chinese nuclear reactor (Letters, 22 September). Why the constant references to hard-pressed bill payers when renewable energy is already cheaper and plummeting in price, and when the planned cuts to solar energy will save households no more than £1.20 a year (Report, 19 October)? Does he think “hard-pressed” people can’t afford to worry about safety? If it’s not to save money or carbon, then what is the huge nuclear subsidy for? The civil nuclear industry is known to provide key expertise and a skills pool for the UK to remain part of the military nuclear club; Sussex University’s science policy research unit suggests that this might explain the government’s unshakeable commitment to this form of energy (Report, 7 August). Consumers are entitled to a full accounting. Exactly what is it that we are expected to contribute to through our bills? Ruth London Fuel Poverty Action • Once the UK solar panel industry has gone the way of the steel industry (Solar subsidy cut attacked as obscene, 19 October), we shall presumably be buying our panels in the future from China, much to George Osborne’s satisfaction. Geoffrey Rider Ripon • Along with a lot of people, I do not hold much faith in our government, sadly. However, I hold even less faith in the governments of countries such as China. So, another nuclear power station is to be built in Suffolk. Did anybody ask local people how they felt about this and if they would be happy that its security would be in the hands of another country? How dare the government hand over things of such vital importance and concern to unknown entities. P Ward Saxmundham, Suffolk • Timothy Garton Ash (If US relations with China turn sour, there will probably be war, 16 October) echoes repeated predictions that, rather than implode politically, an expansionist China is destined to lock horns in war with the US for world superpower primacy. By then China will own the commanding heights of little Britain’s economy: nuclear power generation; water and sewerage; high-speed rail. Yet the prevailing Westminster view is that it is strategically desirable to renew “our own independent” Trident nuclear deterrent – which I understand is only usable with US assent. David Higdon Ryton, Tyne and Wear • Ma Jian (The howls of political prisoners, 19 October) asks whether the UK government would “have had the gall to invite President Botha on a state visit while the world was clamouring for Nelson Mandela’s release”. Mrs Thatcher had the gall, all right, and I have the “No to Botha” badge I wore to the Hyde Park protest rally of 50,000 people in June 1984 to prove it. Susan Seager London • As a member of the Christian Peoples’ Alliance I disagree with many of Jeremy Corbyn’s policies. However, as regards his concern about the poor human rights record of Saudi Arabia and China we are at one. He should take the opportunity of this week’s visit of President Xi Jinping to speak out about issues such as the occupation of Tibet, the discrimination against Christians in many regions, the denial of a free press, treatment of dissidents, and failing to take serious measures to stop the import of animal body parts from endangered species. John Wainwright Potters Bar, Hertfordshire • Ten years ago, when I last visited China, virtually everybody I met raised the issue of human rights. No, they didn’t want to talk about Tibet or political prisoners. They wanted to know how Britain could justify the invasion of Iraq and the abuse of human rights there.

The new reactor in Bradwell, on the heavily protected Blackwater estuary, east of Chelmsford, could be confirmed this week during a state visit to Britain by China’s president, Xi Jinping. The conservation concerns come on top of worries over the security implications of Chinese involvement in the UK nuclear industry. Bradwell is home to one of the UK’s earliest nuclear power stations, which is being gradually disassembled after ceasing operations in 2002. The new plant would be built on adjoining land owned by the French energy company EDF. While some residents near Bradwell welcome the possibility of jobs associated with another power station, objectors say the massively more powerful new plant, designed in China, would require huge amounts of cooling water and could badly affect the delicate ecology of the shallow and slow-moving estuary. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said it feared a new reactor could have a significant effect on the environment and wildlife in the Blackwater and Dengie sites of special scientific interest, as well as wider nature protection areas, including the outer Thames. “The proposed new nuclear power station at Bradwell has the potential to have major impacts on the site and surrounding area on the Essex coast, which includes several nationally and internationally designated protected wildlife sites,” said Mark Nowers, the RSPB’s conservation officer for Essex. “Safeguarding the wildlife and habitats of these fragile natural areas should be foremost in any plans for the site.” Thomas Hickey, from the Marine Conservation Society, said the estuary was designated a site of special scientific interest, a special area of conservation and a special protection area for birds, as well as a marine conservation zone for its native oyster beds. “Concerns around Bradwell chime with wider nervousness regarding the management of marine protected areas,” he said. “We welcome the government’s pledge to complete the ecologically coherent network of MPAs but they must be well managed and not just paper parks.” The Times reported last week that UK security chiefs had expressed concerns to ministers about the proposed investment of Chinese companies. The People’s Liberation Army, which is heavily involved in many Chinese companies, has special units whose sole aim is hacking into private firms overseas to try to gain an edge or steal the latest technological developments. The US surveillance agency, the NSA, and its UK counterpart, GCHQ, also target these units as well as various establishments in China. A GCHQ spokesman, speaking about the general remit it is given by the government rather than specifically about this particular investment by Chinese companies, said: “GCHQ has a remit to support the cyber security of private sector-owned critical national infrastructure projects, including in the civil nuclear sector and nuclear new builds, when invited to do so by the lead government department involved.” The US government has repeatedly and openly expressed concern about the extent of cyber attacks originating in China aimed at American companies as well as military and intelligence targets. The existing Bradwell power station buildings, clad in scaffold and sheeting, look over a flat expanse of farmland and marsh towards the exposed 7th-century chapel of St Peter’s, one of Britain’s oldest surviving churches. In Bradwell, the village closest to the power station, one resident, Lorraine Williams said she would not welcome a replacement nuclear plant. “I do worry about what it would do to the environment,” said the 49-year-old property developer. “When the old power station was operating, if you went paddling the water was sometimes warm, and you’d see lots of jellyfish. “But it would be the extra road traffic that would make me move. We already get 1,000 vehicles a day going to the old power station. If they build it, I’ll rent my house to a Chinese engineer and live somewhere sunny instead.” At the village’s volunteer-run shop, others were more keen about the prospect of a new reactor, though less keen to give their names. Most had either worked at the old plant or had relatives who did. “I spent 15 years showing tour groups round it,” said one woman. “My husband was an engineer. We never had any problems with it.” The main protest group, Blackwater Against New Nuclear Group, is based across the estuary in West Mersea. Andy Blowers, who heads the organisation, is an academic and nuclear waste expert, and was a member of the government-appointed Committee on Radioactive Waste Management. He said the amounts of cooling water needed for the new plant would either badly damage the local ecosystem, or require the construction of pipelines several miles to the sea. “This isn’t a nimby position,” Blowers said. “We think it is an absolutely inappropriate site, a completely irresponsible place to put it. “The government is basically saying: ‘We’d like to sacrifice the Blackwater estuary in order to lever-in Chinese investment, for them to do a demonstration on how good their plant is, to flog it elsewhere.’ I don’t understand why we should be a platform for that.” When the original plant was constructed, the site, a former second world war airfield, had to first be raised above sea level. Blowers said of the plans for a new reactor: “Why put this on a site that is so vulnerable to climate change, storm surges, all of that? What people forget, this thing isn’t here today, gone tomorrow. It’s got something like a 60-year lifespan, and beyond that you’re going to have radioactive waste on that site, I would say, indefinitely.” In a statement, the Department for Energy and Climate Change said new nuclear power stations were “a vital part of our long-term plan to provide secure, clean energy supplies”. It added: “Before any new nuclear site can start generating low-carbon electricity, there are a number of planning, safety and security standards to meet, along with further consultations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2017/feb/23/the-ladybird-book-illustrations-artwork-gallery-museum-english-rural-life","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-23T16:48:11Z","webTitle":"Entire art gallery of Ladybird book covers is world first","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/23/the-ladybird-book-illustrations-artwork-gallery-museum-english-rural-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2017/feb/23/the-ladybird-book-illustrations-artwork-gallery-museum-english-rural-life","fields":{"headline":"Entire art gallery of Ladybird book covers is world first","bodyText":"If all you knew of the world came from a Ladybird book, you would be forgiven for believing factories are always shining temples of industry and optimism rather than zero-hours sweatshops, policemen are invariably handsome and friendly, and mothers wear white gloves to take their impeccably dressed children shopping. The world’s first permanent gallery devoted to this wholesome, primary-coloured universe has opened at the Museum of English Rural Life in Reading. Archivist Guy Baxter said the archive of more than 20,000 images had been preserved by Reading University since Penguin took over from the original publishers. “There are many legends about this collection: it is certainly true that one police force bought many copies of Motor Mechanics, but the jury is still out on whether scores of copies of How to Read Maps were really bought by the Ministry of Defence for the Falklands war,” Baxter said. The displays include original artwork by some of Ladybird’s best illustrators, including Charles Tunnicliffe who was, Baxter says, hopeless with human figures but a genius with nature; his enchanting view of a hare leaping from a newly ploughed furrow is among the pieces on display. Another of the early artists was Reading’s own Allen W Seaby, a painter and amateur ornithologist who became the first head of the university’s fine art department. A proof sheet shows how little the books, first issued in 1915 by the Loughborough publishers Wills and Hepworth, changed once they settled on a standard format to cope with wartime paper shortages: a single large sheet of paper printed on both sides gave 56 pages of text and illustrations, and a cover. The books were priced for almost 30 years at half a crown. Within the cramped format authors tackled subjects as complex and varied as prehistoric Britain, nuclear power, practical woodwork, Arthurian legend, and Pope John Paul II. From 1964, the insufferably well behaved Peter and Jane were introduced in the How to Read series. Recently, the parodic Ladybird titles for grown-ups have proved runaway bestsellers, earning an estimated £30m for Penguin. The Reading gallery has scores of titles shelved chronologically from 1961’s Learning to Read Numbers, to current titles such as Climate Change by HRH The Prince of Wales, whose 50 pages are credited with two more co-authors and eight peer reviewers. Prince Charles’s book is one of three new “expert” titles, for which the first new artwork in 40 years was commissioned. Before that illustrations were endlessly recycled and updated where necessary: an early space exploration image was overpainted to show that the Eagle had landed in 1969, and the curators found a new head had been glued on top of one image of Jane. Baxter wonders if modern viewers will be charmed or chagrined by the Ladybird worldview. “Will they just feel nostalgia,” he said, “or perhaps worry about this very simplistic, sanitised view of the world we were presented with, and passed on to our own children?” Baxter’s own favourite is King John and Magna Carta, which was first published in 1969 and – in common with hundreds of other Ladybird titles – has never been out of print since. He has insisted it be stocked in the museum shop, and can quote from memory its magnificent take-no-prisoners introduction: “King John was probably the worst king ever to mount the English throne. He was cruel and treacherous, a boastful coward; mean and deceitful as a man, utterly untrustworthy as a king. He died loathed by everyone who knew him, regretted by none.” “Loathed by everyone, regretted by none,” Baxter says, with relish. “That’s the way to do it.” The gallery will be officially launched in March, with a display of the artwork for Climate Change, but is already open, free of charge, every day except Mondays."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-20T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"The troubling evolution of corporate greenwashing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies","fields":{"headline":"The troubling evolution of corporate greenwashing","bodyText":"In the mid-1980s, oil company Chevron commissioned a series of expensive television and print ads to convince the public of its environmental bonafides. Titled People Do, the campaign showed Chevron employees protecting bears, butterflies, sea turtles and all manner of cute and cuddly animals. The commercials were very effective – in 1990, they won an Effie advertising award, and subsequently became a case study at Harvard Business school. They also became notorious among environmentalists, who have proclaimed them the gold standard of greenwashing – the corporate practice of making diverting sustainability claims to cover a questionable environmental record. The term greenwashing was coined by environmentalist Jay Westerveld in 1986, back when most consumers received their news from television, radio and print media – the same outlets that corporations regularly flooded with a wave of high-priced, slickly-produced commercials and print ads. The combination of limited public access to information and seemingly unlimited advertising enabled companies to present themselves as caring environmental stewards, even as they were engaging in environmentally unsustainable practices. But greenwashing dates back even earlier. American electrical behemoth Westinghouse’s nuclear power division was a greenwashing pioneer. Threatened by the 1960’s anti-nuclear movement, which raised questions about its safety and environmental impact, it fought back with a series of ads proclaiming the cleanliness and safety of nuclear power plants. One, featuring a photograph of a nuclear plant nestled by a pristine lake, proclaimed that “We’re building nuclear power plants to give you more electricity,” and went on to say that nuclear plants were “odorless [...] neat, clean, and safe”. Some of these claims were true: in 1969, Westinghouse nuclear plants were producing large amounts of cheap electricity with far less air pollution than competing coal plants. However, given that the ads appeared after nuclear meltdowns had already occurred in Michigan and Idaho, the word “safe” was arguable. Westinghouse’s ads also ignored concerns about the environmental impact of nuclear waste, which has continued to be a problem. The mysterious case of the stolen towels In 1983, when Jay Westerveld first got the idea for the term greenwashing, he wasn’t thinking about nuclear power – he was thinking about towels. An undergraduate student on a research trip to Samoa, he stopped off in Fiji to surf. At the sprawling Beachcomber Resort, he saw a note asking customers to pick up their towels. “It basically said that the oceans and reefs are an important resource, and that reusing the towels would reduce ecological damage,” Westerveld recalls. “They finished by saying something like, ‘Help us to help our environment’.” Westerveld wasn’t actually staying at the resort – he was lodging at a “grubby” guesthouse nearby, and had just snuck in to steal some clean towels. Even so, he was struck by the note’s irony: while it claimed to be protecting the island’s ecosystem, he says, the Beachcomber – which, today, describes itself as “the most sought-after destination in the South Pacific” – was expanding. “I don’t think they really cared all that much about the coral reefs,” he says. “They were in the middle of expanding at the time, and were building more bungalows.” Three years later, in 1986, when he was writing a term paper on multiculturalism, Westerveld remembered the note. “I finally wrote something like, ‘It all comes out in the greenwash.’ A guy in the class with me worked for a literary magazine and had me write an essay about it.” And, as the magazine had a large readership in nearby New York City, it wasn’t long before the term caught on in the wider media. Westerveld’s essay came out a year after the launch of Chevron’s People Do campaign. As critics later pointed out, many of the environmental programs that Chevron promoted in its campaign were mandated by law. They were also relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost of Chevron’s ad budget: environmental activist Joshua Karliner estimated that Chevron’s butterfly preserve cost it $5,000 per year to run, while the ads promoting it cost millions of dollars to produce and broadcast. The People Do campaign also ignored Chevron’s spotty environmental record: while it was running the ads, it was also violating the clean air act, the clean water act and spilling oil into wildlife refuges. But Chevron was far from the only company digging deep into the greenwashing cesspool. In 1989, chemical company DuPont announced its new double-hulled oil tankers with ads featuring marine animals clapping their flippers and wings in chorus to Beethoven’s Ode to Joy. However, as environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth pointed out in its report Hold the Applause, the company was the single largest corporate polluter in the US. Other corporate claims were equally outrageous: forestry giant Weyerhaeuser ran ads claiming that it was “serious” about caring for fish – even as it was cutting down trees in some of its forests and destabilizing salmon habitats. Muddying the waters By the early 1990s, consumers were wising up to sustainability concerns: polls showed that companies’ environmental records influenced the majority of consumer purchases. This interest in the environment brought an increased awareness of the greenwashing; by the end of the decade, the word had officially entered the English language with its inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary. Since then, the trend has only increased: a 2015 Nielsen poll showed that 66% of global consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally sustainable products. Among millennials, that number jumps to 72%. “People are getting more aware of the rarity of the Earth and the ways that our actions impact it,” says Jason Ballard, CEO of sustainable home improvement retailer TreeHouse. At the same time, he notes, greenwashing has become more complex. “It’s the dark side of a very positive development,” he says. One shift has been outreach. Many companies are now working to engage customers in their sustainability efforts, even as their core business model remains environmentally unsustainable. The Home Depot and Lowes, for example, both encourage customers to do their part by offering onsite recycling for several products, including compact fluorescent lights and plastic bags. Meanwhile, they continue to sell billions of dollars per year worth of environmentally damaging products, such as paints that are loaded with toxic ingredients and which release noxious fumes. “It’s misdirection, and it’s intended to shift the customer’s focus from a company’s appalling behaviors to something that’s peripheral,” Ballard says. The bottled water conundrum Another trend, says Jonah Sachs, CEO of branding agency Free Range Studios, is linking sustainability claims to other issues, such as personal health. “There’s this perception that personal health and environmental sustainability are two sides of the same coin,” he says. “Sometimes this is true, but many times it isn’t. Bottled water is a great example: in terms of health, it’s much better than soda or other drinks, but in terms of the environment and sustainability, it’s ridiculous.” The water industry trades heavily on images of rugged mountains and pristine lakes to sell its products. And many companies – Nestle, in particular – spend millions of dollars trying to convince the public that their bottled water isn’t only good to drink, but is also good for the planet. Over the past few years, the bottled water giant has claimed that its Eco-Shape bottle is more efficient, that its Resource recycled plastic bottle is more environmentally responsible and that its use of plant-based plastics is less damaging to the planet. In 2008, Nestle Waters Canada even ran an ad claiming: “Bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.” Several Canadian groups quickly filed a complaint against the company. Five years later, during Earth Day 2013, the International Bottled Water Association doubled down on the sustainability claims, announcing that bottled water was “the face of positive change” because the industry was using less plastic in its bottles and relying more on recycled plastic. Sustainability promises aside, only about 31% of plastic bottles end up getting recycled, which means that “the face of positive change” creates millions of tons of garbage every year, much of which ends up in landfills or the ocean. And the water that goes in the bottles is often equally unsustainable. Nestle’s Arrowhead water claims that “Mother Nature is our muse” and boasts that it “has a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources” to ensure responsible water stewardship. This sounds promising until one considers that those springs are in California, which has been in a state of drought for five years. The company also bottles water in Arizona and Oregon, both of which are also experiencing droughts. A golden oldie Some of the classic greenwashers are also taking cues from the new greenwashing playbook. In 2013, amid worries about unemployment and continued concerns about energy sustainability, Westinghouse put a fresh face on its old claims with a brand new commercial. “Did you know that nuclear energy is the largest source of clean air energy in the world?” the ad asked viewers right before claiming that its nuclear power plants “provide cleaner air, create jobs, and help sustain the communities where they operate”. What the commercial failed to mention was that, two years earlier, Westinghouse was cited by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for concealing flaws in its reactor designs and submitting false information to regulators. And, in February 2016, another plant that uses Westinghouse reactors, New York’s Indian Point, leaked radioactive material into the surrounding area’s groundwater. Greenwashing may have taken on a new shape in the last decade, but it’s still as murky as ever."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2017/mar/14/unilever-british-companies-foreign-bids-marmite-kraft-heinz","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-15T07:22:13Z","webTitle":"UK government should help companies targeted by foreign bids, says Unilever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/14/unilever-british-companies-foreign-bids-marmite-kraft-heinz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/14/unilever-british-companies-foreign-bids-marmite-kraft-heinz","fields":{"headline":"UK government should help companies targeted by foreign bids, says Unilever","bodyText":"The boss of Unilever has urged the government to provide more help for Britain’s largest companies when they are targeted by foreign takeovers. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever – the maker of Marmite, Magnum ice cream and Dove soap – said there should be a level playing field for British companies so they could enjoy the stronger levels of protection that businesses received in other countries. Last month Unilever was the target of a £115bn takeover bid by Kraft Heinz, which was backed by Warren Buffet and private equity firm 3G. Kraft Heinz withdrew the offer after it was firmly rejected by Unilever, amid reports the UK government was concerned about the ramifications of a deal. However, Unilever believes UK takeover rules should be changed to provide more support for the company that is targeted by a foreign bid, for example enabling it to have more time to build a defence against the offer and encouraging directors to consider the interests of other stakeholders – such as employees – rather than just shareholders. At present directors claim it is their fiduciary duty to focus on the interests of shareholders when they receive a takeover bid. Polman told the Financial Times: “We’re not talking about protection. We are saying that when you have a situation like this, with a national champion, there should be a level playing field.” Countries such as the US, France and the Netherlands have more safeguards in place to protect “national champions” and block takeovers. In the Netherlands companies must consider a broader range of stakeholders when analysing a bid. The government is planning to publish draft proposals in the coming weeks that would outline how it would respond to foreign takeovers and bids for key infrastructure projects in the future. Theresa May has previously said the government should have more powers to block predatory bids for companies in important industries for the economy. The prime minister has indicated she would have blocked Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury in 2010 and Pfizer’s failed attempt to buy pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said last month: “We have taken the opportunity to look at our arrangements to make sure they are kept up to date. We have said we would do that in the context of mergers, particularly if it relates to critical infrastructure, as outlined by the Hinkley Point C decision [to build a new nuclear power station with funding from China]. So we will be setting out some proposals in the weeks ahead.” At present the government can only block takeovers on the basis of national security, financial stability and media plurality. Existing takeover rules also mean Kraft Heinz is blocked from making another bid for Unilever for six months after scrapping its initial attempt. Nonetheless, Unilever has taken steps to protect itself from another takeover attempt by pledging to conduct a “comprehensive review of options” to improve value for shareholders. After Kraft Heinz announced it was walking away from the potential deal, Unilever said in a statement: “The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever. We expect the review to be completed by early April, after which we will communicate further.” Unilever employs 7,500 people in the UK, including at its London headquarters and its research and development hub in Port Sunlight, Merseyside. The company, whose shares are listed in the UK and the Netherlands, is one of the biggest consumer goods groups in the world. Its brands range from foods such as Flora, Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Knorr, to Doveskincare and Lynx deodorant, to cleaning products such as Domestos and Persil. Unilever’s origins date back to 1885 when William and James Lever created Sunlight, the world’s first branded and packaged soap for washing clothes. Unilever was formed in 1929 when Lever Brothers merged with Dutch company Margarine Unie. Polman became chief executive of Unilever in 2009. He was previously the finance director at Nestlé and spent more than 20 years at Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Fairy washing-up liquid and Gillette, the shaving brand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2017/apr/18/rauma-spotlight-city-celebrates-575-years-finland-turns-100","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-18T06:15:21Z","webTitle":"Rauma in the spotlight: city celebrates 575 years as Finland turns 100","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/apr/18/rauma-spotlight-city-celebrates-575-years-finland-turns-100","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2017/apr/18/rauma-spotlight-city-celebrates-575-years-finland-turns-100","fields":{"headline":"Rauma in the spotlight: city celebrates 575 years as Finland turns 100","bodyText":"The city of a smidgen under 40,000 people on Finland’s west coast, clustered around an immaculate Unesco-garlanded wooden old town, celebrates its 575th anniversary this week. Depending on how you classify these things, that makes Rauma either the country’s third, fourth or fifth oldest chartered town. Anyway, it’s old … with enough of a concentration of culture to make Unesco look twice: the bronze age cairns at nearby Sammallahdenmäki also made it on to the World Heritage list. Finland’s gateway “It means a lot,” says 33-year-old freelance writer and travel blogger Saana Jaakkola, who has lived here for 12 years. “People here are very proud of their roots. It’s boosting how proud we are about our hometown – which has been a little bit forgotten about by the rest of Finland.” The marketplace is the focus for the anniversary programme – including theatre in the local dialect, concerts, dance and children’s events – that culminates on 19 April. Rauma’s big day falls in the auspicious centenary year for the whole country – but the town has always looked further. The dialect, still spoken by older residents, borrows from Swedish, Estonian and German, the regions with which Rauma had its original trade links. Various international businesses – a Rolls-Royce plant, a neighbouring Franco-German nuclear power plant – mean it is surprisingly cosmopolitan for a small place. City in numbers … 800 Residents in the old town 57 Vessels in the town’s fleet in 1897, Finland’s largest at the time 5.6m Tonnes of freight in 2016 handled by the port, the country’s fifth largest 99 Percentage of the town’s heating supplied from the local paper mill site, its key industry. “Sometimes when the wind is right, it brings weird smells into the town from the mill,” says Jaakkola. “We have a saying: ‘That’s the smell of money.’” … and pictures Local artist Tarmo Thorström has created light artworks that, projected on to the town hall during the last two winters, pay tribute to Rauma’s long lace-making tradition. History in 100 words Rauma has always had a salty tang about it. The town chartered in 1442 had grown up around a Franciscan monastery, but it became an important medieval port. Their laxmän (salmon men) as they were known in Stockholm, ran fish, fur, seal blubber and animal skins over the Gulf of Bothnia to the Swedish capital, to Tallinn and the Hanseatic cities. Later, it was timber to England and the Mediterranean, and now paper. The seafaring legacy can still be seen in the windows of the old town, Jaakkola says. “You might see little dog statues there. When the husbands were away at sea, then the wives might have had some, ahem, other visitors. If the dog was facing out on to the street, that meant it’s safe to come; but if it was facing indoors, it meant the husband is home – don’t come. Maybe they just send chat messages now.” Rauma in sound and vision The pristine Nordic structures of the old town were the inspiration for Sim City-style video game City of Rauma by local boy Juho Ruohola. RMJ electronic music festival returned to Rauma in 2016 after a brief hiatus, and will take place again on 22-24 June. Here’s a short blast from last year’s headliner David Guetta. What’s everyone talking about? Six hundred people lost their jobs when Korean company STX pulled out of the local shipyards at the end of 2013. “It was a huge shock, a complete mess,” says Jaakkola. But it’s turned into a story of plucky self-sufficiency to warm the cockles of local enterprise advocates everywhere. The municipality bought the property for €18m, and Rauma Marine Constructions was born in 2014, ensuring jobs were saved and 500 years of shipbuilding continued. “Now it’s growing fast, with lots of new orders,” says Jaakkola. One included a 5,000-tonne deck towed last year to its final mooring place off the Burj al-Arab hotel in Dubai; the Finnish navy has just ordered four new vessels. What’s next for the city? In addition to the port, Rauma also has one of Finland’s largest leisure marinas. “People here don’t ask what kind of house you have, or how much money you have. They ask what kind of boat you have,” says Jaakkola. The town’s looking to bolster its modern tourism capacity away from the old town – further development of the coastal area (perhaps neglected because of the 30-minute walk from the centre, which was next to the coast during medieval times) is coming. It’s being driven by “hands-on” local businessman Riku Räsänen, who founded the RMJ festival and owns the Poroholma camping site where part of it takes place. An adjacent outdoor swimming pool, which had fallen into disrepair, is also due to reopen in 2018 under Räsänen’s stewardship.

Corbyn, who was questioned on the comments after addressing Labour’s local government conference at Warwick University, said: “Well, it’s not helpful. I would ask those to think about this – the referendum gave a result, gave a very clear decision on this, and we have to respect that decision, that’s why we didn’t block article 50. “But we are going to be part of all this campaigning, all these negotiations about the kind of relationship we have in Europe in the future.. The referendum happened, let’s respect the result. Democracy happened, respect the result.” Earlier Corbyn said people were dying at the hands of the government’s austerity policies in a scathing attack on the prime minister days before two crucial byelections. The Labour leader blamed ministers for an “emergency” in local services and a social care crisis caused by “disgraceful neglect” as he urged voters in Copeland and Stoke-on-Trent to “send a message” to Theresa May on 23 February that they had had enough of cuts. In a speech to Labour councillors at Warwick University, Corbyn said: “We have a state of emergency in our social care system and the worst crisis in the history of our NHS.” He added that the situation in social care was an “absolute scandal that leaves 1.2 million elderly people without the care they need”. Corbyn cited a report in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine that said the crisis was linked to 30,000 excess deaths in 2015. “People are dying because of the choices made by this government,” he said. “Councils are at breaking point on social care. Our social care system has been privatised, outsourced and cut. It has dehumanised our parents, grandparents and neighbours.” Corbyn vowed that a Labour government would provide the NHS and social care with adequate funds while accusing May of leading a government that gives billions away in tax breaks to big business and the richest in society while cutting services for the most vulnerable. He said: “It is this callousness, even brutality, that has put local services in a state of emergency.” The twin byelections, caused by the resignation of Labour MPs Jamie Reed and Tristram Hunt, represent Corbyn’s toughest electoral challenge yet. The Conservatives are hoping to win Copeland from Labour, which is trailing in the polls. Corbyn’s past opposition to nuclear power is viewed with suspicion among many voters in the Cumbrian constituency, which is economically reliant on the Sellafield nuclear processing facility. The party’s battle to retain the two seats suffered a further blow after Corbyn’s campaigns chief, Simon Fletcher, quit on Friday over an apparent clash with Labour’s inner team over the direction of the party. The sudden resignation of one of his closest aides follows the resignations of four shadow cabinet members over Corbyn’s support for the article 50 bill. Corbyn said on Saturday that Fletcher would continue working with Labour. “Simon and I are great friends and will remain great friends. We had a good chat last night. I’ve known Simon for 25 years, he’s a great friend of mind and he is going to do other things, but will continue working with us.” In Stoke, which voted strongly in favour of Brexit in last year’s referendum, the main challenge is expected to come from Ukip, where the party leader, Paul Nuttall, is standing. Corbyn, who is expected to campaign in the constituency on Saturday, claimed Labour would “defeat Ukip’s politics of hate”. A Ukip spokesman said Labour had taken the people of Stoke for granted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/oct/18/solar-subsidies-slashed-but-sun-shines-on-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-18T13:09:45Z","webTitle":"Solar subsidies are slashed, but the sun always seems to shine on nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/18/solar-subsidies-slashed-but-sun-shines-on-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/18/solar-subsidies-slashed-but-sun-shines-on-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Solar subsidies are slashed, but the sun always seems to shine on nuclear","bodyText":"A glaring anomaly of British energy policy will be on display this week: the government will loudly trumpet a nuclear deal with China, and then will come a no-fanfare end to a controversial solar subsidy consultation. President Xi Jinping will probably sign a heads of agreement with David Cameron that will allow the government to say that a new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is on its way. The groundwork for the deal was done by George Osborne on his recent trip to Beijing, with the chancellor determined to roll away any obstacles that could halt China becoming a major investor at Hinkley – and beyond. The chief developer of the new nuclear reactors in the south-west – the first for 20 years – is EDF, which has also been trying to woo state-owned Chinese companies to invest in the £24.5bn scheme. Only by promising to allow the Chinese to build their own replacement plant at Bradwell in Essex have Osborne and Cameron finally won Beijing’s support for Hinkley. After that it will be up to EDF to press the final investment button and for construction to start in earnest. Britain undoubtedly needs new electricity generating capacity as old nuclear and coal-fired power stations reach the end of their lives or are retired – in the case of the latter because of their carbon emissions. And the public has been willing to give atomic power another chance on the grounds that greenhouse gases are a bigger threat than radioactive waste, safety issues and other risks uniquely posed by nuclear technology. But EDF and its engineering partner Areva have queered their own pitch by presiding over mounting cost overruns and project delays at pioneering projects in Finland and France under the control of one or both. Meanwhile the government has been forced to guarantee a subsidy price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years to EDF to get this far on a scheme that was meant to produce power in 2017 but now will not be ready till 2024 – and only then if it does not run into the kind of logistical and other difficulties that have hampered similar kinds of plants at Olkiluoto and Flamanville. Ministers have been relentlessly supportive of nuclear, talking up the number of jobs being created – 25,000 in the construction phase – and talking down the worries about safety, waste, delays and national security. At the same time the Conservative government has been waging what looks like a determined war against solar and other renewables, highlighted by a proposed 87% cut in subsidies from 1 January on rooftop solar panel installations. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost in the past 10 days as three major solar installers have closed their doors in anticipation that ministers will bring burgeoning demand for small solar schemes to an abrupt halt. Unlike the warm words of encouragement and firm policy help for nuclear, there has been a relentlessly negative attack on the solar industry, which ministers have suddenly decided should now stand on its own feet. There have been constant references to hard-pressed bill payers, with the intermittent nature of solar and wind being highlighted by the Department of Energy and Climate Change against the advantages of constant power from nuclear. These generalisations hide a different truth. Renewable energy is largely a new UK private-sector success story, where costs are falling fast and which deserves considered and time-limited support. Nuclear power is a mature technology run by state-owned companies from France and China where costs seem to constantly rise and where 35-year price commitments at double the cost of existing wholesale power should not be being given. With power capacity margins falling so low that many warn the lights could go out this winter, you have to conclude that the government lacks competence as well as vision. Labour’s bank review must be radical Like the Japanese soldiers who spent decades deep in the jungle believing the second world war was still raging outside, central bankers have a tendency to fight their old enemies, regardless of how much the world has changed. With trouble brewing in global financial markets and little or no ammunition left in central bankers’ armouries, questions are growing about whether inflation-targeting – the regime that evolved after the searing experience of the 1970s inflationary shocks – is up to the job. Some experts fear that by focusing on stabilising prices, central bankers have put too little emphasis on growth, financial stability and unemployment. As a result, warned HSBC’s Stephen King recently, the world economy may be sailing towards an iceberg. So the decision of Labour’s new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to commission the up-and-at-’em Anglo-American economist Danny Blanchflower to review the role of the Bank of England is timely. Blanchflower has been one of the fiercest critics of the Bank’s record, since leaving its interest-rate-setting monetary policy committee in 2009. His new committee has serious heft. Blanchflower will be joined by monetary policy expert (and fierce critic of austerity) Simon Wren-Lewis; his fellow former MPC member Adam Posen; and former Treasury select committee chair John McFall. British lefties have long had a deep-held suspicion of central bankers, believing they are small-c conservatives, fixated with assuaging the international bond markets – and McDonnell has previously expressed his scepticism about Bank independence. But Blanchflower and his colleagues are expected to focus their attention more on whether paying attention to other indicators, such as unemployment or economic output, might help the monetary policy committee to steer around future icebergs. Blanchflower is keen to examine whether a US Federal Reserve-style mandate, which includes promoting maximum employment as well as controlling inflation, might have helped the MPC to anticipate the turmoil of 2008-09 better — a labour market expert, he felt at the time that unemployment was a good indicator of the underlying health in the economy. But he and his colleagues might also be wise to take a step back and ask whether an even more radical rethink of the best way to manage monetary policy is necessary. Uber ruling is welcome Black cabs are as quintessentially London as Nelson’s column or a red double decker, but few tears were shed for them by the travelling public after the legality of Uber’s operation was affirmed this week. In truth, the ruling may not have been the watershed many hoped: Uber would have tweaked its app and rolled on. But the fact that the taxi trade is governed by rules so arcane that a judge had to decide if a smartphone is a meter highlights the problem. Uber’s technology lets it slip through the regulatory net. When it comes to as safety, Uber in fact provides more reassurance, with details of drivers, journeys and transactions. The authorities should rightly beware its Silicon Valley “common sense”, which could ignore boring things like tax, access and congestion. But when consumers decry the regulation that is supposed to protect them, it clearly has to be overhauled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jul/24/monday-briefing-alcohol-deaths-on-a-huge-scale","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-24T05:32:14Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: alcohol deaths on a huge scale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/24/monday-briefing-alcohol-deaths-on-a-huge-scale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jul/24/monday-briefing-alcohol-deaths-on-a-huge-scale","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: alcohol deaths on a huge scale","bodyText":"Top story: An avoidable ‘public health crisis’ Good morning to you, Graham Russell here with the news to start your week. The debate over a minimum price on alcohol has been reignited by fresh research showing nearly 63,000 people will die in the next five years from liver problems linked to heavy drinking, at a cost to the NHS of close to £17bn. Senior medical figures and health charities have called it a “public health crisis” and urged the government to act. “Our new report strengthens the argument for intervention by revealing the full and alarming extent of the financial costs associated with inaction in these areas,” said liver specialist Prof Roger Williams (who treated George Best). Liver disease is one of Britain’s biggest killers, claiming about 12,000 lives a year in England alone. The number of deaths associated with it has risen by 400% since 1970. “The evidence is clear: raise the price of the cheapest alcohol to save lives and save money,” said Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies. * * * Brexit jitters? – The IMF has cuts its growth forecast for the UK by 0.3 percentage points, its first downgrade since the EU referendum in June 2016. It had initially raised its forecasts after the Brexit vote but 2017 had been “tepid”, the IMF’s economic counsellor, Maurice Obstfeld, said, adding: “The ultimate impact of Brexit on the UK remains unclear.” The biggest Eurozone countries all had their forecasts upgraded. See here for how Brexit has affected the UK economy in July and a wider analysis from our regular Brexit watch series. * * * ‘Search for the truth’ – A fresh appeal has been made for victims of sexual abuse in football to come forward, in particular those who reported the abuse at the time or believed clubs were aware of the incident. So far, 741 alleged victims have contacted the investigation, with 276 suspects named, at every level of the sport in the wake of the Guardian’s revelations. * * * Diana, 20 years on – Personal images from an album belonging to Princess Diana have been published alongside candid interviews with her two sons in which they speak of their last conversation with her. Twenty years after her death, Princes William and Harry say they regret that the chat was so brief (they were young and wanted to go and play with their cousins). “That phone call sticks in my mind quite heavily,” says William, who was 15 at that time. A documentary will be broadcast at 9pm tonight. * * * Boris butts heads – Boris Johnson has taken his irrepressible turn of phrase on tour with him to New Zealand, likening a traditional Maori greeting to something that could start a fight in a Glasgow pub. The local media were on 24-hour gaffe-watch alert and described him as “flamboyant, blond tousled-haired former mayor of London”. * * * Linda Wenzel speaks – The German teenager captured in Iraq has spoken to media, saying she regretted joining Isis and just wanted to get back to her family. “I just want to get away from here,” she was quoted as saying. “I want to get away from the war, from the many weapons, from the noise.” * * * Charlie Gard – The case determining the future of this critically ill baby resumes in the high court this afternoon for a two-day hearing. Justice Francis is set to oversee what parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates said was fresh evidence. It comes amid rancour on all sides, with doctors and the parents themselves receiving threats. On Sunday a small group of activists supporting the couple held a press conference and a prayer vigil outside the high court in London. * * * Goodbye Snooty – It’s been a rough weekend for celebrity animals. Snooty, thought to be the world’s oldest manatee, has died after getting stuck in a hatch at a Florida museum. It was 69. The museum’s head, Jeff Rodgers, said: “We’ve given a lot of hugs on the front porch of the museum today.” This followed the death of Stubbs, a cat who was mayor of the Alaskan town of Talkeetna, at the age of 20. And lest we forget the 200 sheep that died last weekend after being scared off of a cliff by a bear in the Pyrenees. * * * Lunchtime read: Tsipras the Greek hero “The worst is clearly behind us.” So says Alexis Tsipras, the former communist youth activist who is now the longest serving premier in the eight years Greece has spent trying to keep bankruptcy at bay. Speaking exclusively to Helena Smith in Athens, he sounds a distinctly upbeat tone: “We can now say with certainty that the economy is on the up … Slowly, slowly, what nobody believed could happen, will happen. We will extract the country from the crisis … and in the end that will be judged.” Sport England captain Heather Knight has predicted that her team’s historic World Cup victory, after they had quite literally nearly dropped the trophy, will transform the face of cricket in Britain after a pulsating finale at Lord’s in front of the largest crowd ever to watch a women’s game in this country. Chris Froome, with his fourth Tour de France in the bag thanks to one of the strongest final weeks he can remember, is now likely to move on to the Tour of Spain, depending on his form. Jordan Spieth, with memories of his collapse at the 2016 Masters still fresh, finally silenced the devil on his shoulder after an astonishing 13th-hole recovery paved the way for victory at the 146th Open Championship. And in football, Jodie Taylor’s strike ensured England weathered Spanish possession to win 2-0 and move towards qualification for the knockout phase of Euro 2017, while a farcical penalty shootout, in which seven of 10 kicks were missed, saw Manchester United overcome Real Madrid in a pre-season friendly in Santa Clara. Business The government’s search for a new industrial strategy has yielded a £246m investment in battery technology to be announced by business secretary Greg Clark today. More battery storage could help the growth of renewable power, as urged in a report by engineering group Arup which says the cost of windfarms has fallen so much it is half the price of nuclear power. In the markets, stocks were down again in Asia overnight after a 10-day winning streak ended on Friday. The pound is at $1.301, and buying €1.115 as the resurgence in the single currency comes at a bad time for holidaying Britons. The papers The FT has the startling story that two Wall Street bankers have enjoyed a $314m “share bonanza” after Trump’s election victory. The Guardian leads with “Doctors warn of soaring UK alcohol deaths” and says liver problems linked to heavy drinking will kill 63,000 people over the next five years. The Times has the headline “Oxford in fake awards farce” and reports that Ukrainian businessmen are selling bogus awards for thousands of pounds in the university’s name. The Mail splashes with “Corbyn’s student debt humiliation”. It says the Labour leader has admitted he did not know the extent of student debt when he suggested a write-off of loans before the election. The Daily Telegraph leads with “A&amp;E plan to divert patients ‘risks lives’” and says NHS officials have ordered a review of schemes meant to wean out the least-sick patients at casualty departments. The Sun says a man has been arrested after a CCTV camera at a football ground was allegedly used to “spy” on a young girl in her home.

It was past time to go to bed, but I ended up watching the whole thing. Aftermath: Population Zero imagines that overnight humanity vanishes from the planet. You may have seen it. The immediate effects of human departure are sentimentally saddening: pets die, no longer competent to fend for themselves. Some livestock fares poorly, though other domesticated animals romp happily into the wild. Water cooling fuel rods of nuclear power plants evaporate, and you’d think that would be the end of everything – but it isn’t. Radioactivity subsides. Mankind’s monuments to itself decay, until every last skyscraper has rusted and returned to dirt. Animals proliferate, flora thrive, forests rise. Bounty, abundance and beauty abound. Antelopes leap from wafting golden grasses. It was all very exhilarating, really. I went to sleep that night with a lightened heart. Ever since, that wafting grasses image has been a comforting touchstone. We speak often of “destroying the planet” when what we mean is destroying its habitability for humans. The humblingly immense else-ness of what is, in which our species is collectively a speck, extant for an eye blink, lets us off the hook. Global warming, Syrian civil war, domestic violence, Donald Trump? This too shall pass. I’m not a religious person. Chances are that the universe neither treasures nor regrets us. It permits us, with a marvellous neutrality, and later it may permit artificial intelligence, humanity 2.0, or a lot more bugs instead. We can’t comprehend all that phantasmagorical stuff out there, but we also can’t kill it. That gives me hope. Although we’re a remarkably successful biological manifestation – and so is mould – our aptitude for annihilation is largely limited to wiping ourselves out. The gift of self-destruction is a minor, not to mention stupid, power, and apparently humanity’s suicide would be relatively safe, like a controlled explosion. The universe would get on perfectly well without us once we’d gone. I strongly associate the notion of aftermath with TC Boyle’s short story Chicxulub. While relating the intimate, personal account of learning that his teenage daughter has been hit, perhaps fatally, by a car, the narrator digresses to explain the shockingly high likelihood that our planet will be hit by an asteroid large enough to extinguish our species. For the narrator, his daughter’s death and the end of the world are indistinguishable. The text is shot through with a piercing sorrow, over all our pending losses – of children, of the world we’ve made together as a race. This, too, gives me hope – that I’m not a misanthrope after all. I would miss my brother, my husband; with all our shortcomings, I would also miss the family of man. The capacity for grief, the flipside of love, consoles me as much as the detached long view of aftermath."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-07T14:31:33Z","webTitle":"Chinese firm with military ties invited to bid for role in UK's nuclear future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/07/chinese-firm-with-military-ties-invited-to-bid-for-role-in-uks-nuclear-future","fields":{"headline":"Chinese firm with military ties invited to bid for role in UK's nuclear future","bodyText":"A controversial Chinese company has been selected to bid for millions of pounds of public money in a UK government competition to develop mini nuclear power stations. The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) features twice in a government list of 33 projects and companies deemed eligible to compete for a share in up to £250m to develop so-called small modular reactors (SMR). The involvement of a different Chinese company in the high-profile Hinkley Point C project in Somerset was widely believed to have prompted the government’s decision to pause the deal at the 11th hour last month. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s co-chief of staff, has previously expressed alarm at the prospect of CNNC having such close access to the UK’s energy infrastructure because it would give the state-owned firm the potential ability to build weaknesses into computer systems. The company was formerly China’s Ministry of Nuclear Industry and developed the country’s atomic bomb and nuclear submarines, as well as being a key player in its nuclear power industry. In an article on the ConservativeHome website, Timothy singled out CNNC’s military links as a reason the UK government should be wary of such involvement. “For those who believe that such an eventuality [shutting down UK energy at will] is unlikely, the Chinese National Nuclear Corporation – one of the state-owned companies involved in the plans for the British nuclear plants – says on its website that it is responsible not just for ‘increasing the value of state assets and developing the society’ but the ‘building of national defence’,” he wrote. Tom Burke, chairman of the environment thinktank E3G and a former British government adviser, said there were legitimate concerns over the company. “I don’t fuss very much about the Chinese owning a nuclear power station [China General Nuclear in the case of Hinkley]. But I would be much more concerned about bringing in CNNC because they are known to be much more closely involved with the military and Chinese nuclear weapons programmes,” he said. CNNC was not involved in the original Hinkley deal but it was reported on Sunday that the company has agreed in principle to buy half of China’s 33% stake in the £24bn project if it goes ahead. The list of companies accepted for the competition was published briefly, apparently accidentally, on the website of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Friday before being deleted. It reads as a who’s-who of US, British, Japanese and Chinese industry players hoping to develop and build small modular reactors. These are much smaller than conventional nuclear plants with a capacity of less than 300MW – or a 10th of what Hinkley Point C should provide. They are pitched by industry as a cheaper and quicker way to provide low-carbon energy capacity than conventional big nuclear plants because they could be built in a factory and transported to where their power is needed. The US and UK are racing to be the most attractive home for the first of the new designs to be commissioned. Last November, George Osborne promised £250m over five years for a nuclear research and development programme to “revive the UK’s nuclear expertise and position the UK as a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies”. An undisclosed amount of that sum is for a competition to find the best value SMR design for the UK, to “pave the way” towards building one in the UK in the 2020s. CNNC sits alongside US companies such as NuScale; British ones including Rolls-Royce, Sheffield Forgemasters and Tokamak Energy; Japanese-owned Westinghouse; and the US-Japanese partnership GE-Hitachi, as participants the government considers eligible for phase one of its competition. CNNC’s chief designer of small nuclear plants visited a conference in London last year to pitch a plan for cooperating with UK industry, and is already partnering with Rolls-Royce. It hopes to build the first SMR in the UK, with future ones sold around the world. NuScale Power put itself forward for the competition in the spring. Its design, said its managing director, Tom Mundy, “answers the particular needs of the UK’s energy market and the wider UK economy, and we intend to participate fully in the government’s competition”. The 33 participants will be whittled down in several phases, with the announcement of the eventual winners scheduled for late 2017. Announcing the postponement of the Hinkley decision last month, the business secretary, Greg Clark, said: “The UK needs a reliable and secure energy supply and the government believes that nuclear energy is an important part of the mix.” When asked about the list published on Friday, a spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: “In March 2016, the government launched the first phase of a competition to identify the best value SMR for the UK. The ambition is to create an opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in SMRs. “Those companies which are eligible to participate in the competition have been aware for over two months.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/apr/10/not-just-syria-trump-ratcheting-up-wars-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-10T12:18:15Z","webTitle":"It's not just Syria.

Trump is ratcheting up wars across the world","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s missile strikes on Syria have attracted worldwide attention (and disgraceful plaudits) in recent days. But much less airtime is being given to his administration’s risky and increasingly barbaric military escalations on several other fronts across the world. Let’s put aside, for the time being, that the Trump administration openly admits it has no clue what it is going to do in Syria next. Or that key members of Congress and in the administration are clearly eager for “regime change” in Syria with no plan for the aftermath. And the fact that hardly anyone seems to care that Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev said over the weekend that Syrian strikes put the US “on the verge of a military clash with Russia” – a nuclear power with thousands of warheads. As troubling as these developments are, we should be just as concerned about the explosion of civilian deaths – more than 1,000 in March alone – that have come directly as the result of the Trump administration’s other reckless military campaigns across the Middle East over the past few weeks. Recently, US airstrikes have claimed the lives of 200 civilians in Iraq, dozens were killed in separate strikes supposedly aimed at Islamic State in Syria and several more women and children died in a raid gone awry in Yemen. Those are just a few examples of the many attacks – launched under the pretext of defeating Isis – that wreaked havoc on civilian populations as the US military ramps up its bombing campaigns in multiple counties. At the same time, the Trump administration has been expanding official US “war zones” in Somalia and Yemen, while working to “make it easier for the Pentagon to launch counterterrorism strikes anywhere in the world” and loosening restrictions on preventing civilian deaths that were put in place by the Obama administration, as the Washington Post reported a few weeks ago. Drone strikes, already accelerated under the Obama administration, have increased even more under Trump. Micah Zenko, who tracks the numbers at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted in March that Trump was carrying out a drone strike every 1.8 days, compared to every 5.4 days under Obama. On the other side of the world, the Trump administration is responding to North Korea’s nuclear program with even more saber rattling, sending in US ships over the weekend to the region as some vague “show of force”. This comes just as NBC News reported, “the National Security Council has presented President Donald Trump with options to respond to North Korea’s nuclear program – including putting American nukes in South Korea or killing dictator Kim Jong-un”. Pressure is mounting from the outside too, as the Wall Street Journal’s right wing neocon-in-residence Brett Stephens loudly called for “regime change” in North Korea two weeks ago. And then there’s Iran, which the Weekly Standard’s Bill Kristol is once again saying is the ultimate “prize” for regime change, now that Trump is directly bombing Assad’s forces. Weeks ago, Trump’s defense secretary James Mattis was reportedly planning a brazen and incredibly dangerous operation to board Iranian ships in international waters. This would have effectively been an act of war. Apparently, the only reason the Trump administration didn’t carry it out was because the plan leaked and they were forced to scuttle it – at least temporarily. But that hasn’t stopped the ratcheting up of tensions towards Iran ever since he took office. On top of all this madness, 16 years after America’s longest war in history started, a top general has already testified to Congress that the military wants more troops in Afghanistan to break the “stalemate” there. Well before the end of the Trump administration, there will be troops fighting and dying in Afghanistan who weren’t even born when the 9/11 attacks occurred. To further shield the public from these decisions, the Trump administration indicated a couple weeks ago they have stopped disclosing even the amount of additional troops that they are sending overseas to fight. The numbers were already being downplayed by the Obama administration and received little attention as the numbers continually creeped up over the last two years. Now, the public will have virtually no insight into what its military is doing in those countries. It should go without saying that Bashar al-Assad is a monster and a butcher and the people of Syria have suffered incredibly over the past five years. North Korea is potentially dangerous and unpredictable, and Iran is far from innocent on the world stage. But the idea that starting or expanding wars against these countries is going to solve anything belies the last 15 years of history, where the US has intervened and overthrown leaders in country after country, only to cause even more chaos and destruction, with trillions of dollars and millions of lives lost. With several conflicts likely brewing with countries that have significant military power, the Trump administration is putting the US – and the world – on a potentially catastrophic collision course. And so far, pushback from politicians, the media and anyone else with influence in Washington has barely been seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jan/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-trident-failure-an-alarming-cover-up","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-23T19:29:26Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Trident failure: an alarming cover-up | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-trident-failure-an-alarming-cover-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-trident-failure-an-alarming-cover-up","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Trident failure: an alarming cover-up","bodyText":"Today we finally learned that Theresa May was briefed last summer about the failed test launch of an unarmed nuclear missile, conducted just before she became prime minister. But she chose to withhold that information from MPs about to vote on the renewal of Trident, Britain’s nuclear defence system. Instead, parliament has only been made aware of a potentially serious malfunction in our nuclear capability as a result of leaks to the press. Even then, Mrs May repeatedly sought to obfuscate and evade questions about exactly what she knew when probed by the BBC’s Andrew Marr. Given the number of MPs who voted in favour of Trident renewal, it is unlikely Mrs May coming clean would have changed the result of the parliamentary vote. But that is hardly the point. The failed test raises critical questions about the safety and effectiveness of Britain’s nuclear weapons system, given what was being tested was not cutting-edge technology, but a missile first deployed over 25 years ago, launched using a submarine in service since 1999. The Ministry of Defence has dismissed the test failing as a minor issue, pointing out the submarine in question was returned to service later that month. But the inescapable fact is that a missile supposed to be launched across the southern Atlantic ended up tracing a path towards continental North America. Had it been armed with nuclear warheads the consequences could have been catastrophic. Could such a malfunction, which has happened in one of the only five tests the UK has carried out since 2000, happen again? The government has tried pleading national security as grounds for cover-up. Yet it is almost inconceivable Russia would have been unaware of what had happened. The commander of the submarine involved in the last successful British test launch, in 2012, received a congratulatory message from a Russian spy ship monitoring the launch, according to a book on the UK’s nuclear submarines by Peter Hennessy and James Jinks. Why, then, conceal what happened from MPs? All this creates the alarming impression of a prime minister comfortable concealing critical truths from parliament in order to avoid making the debate about Trident renewal trickier than she felt it had to be. This is only the latest in a series of poor judgments six months into her premiership. Mrs May has considerable form when it comes to sidelining parliament, contesting its right to a vote on triggering article 50 all the way up to the supreme court. She has stubbornly refused to countenance further funding for the NHS and social care, reportedly telling NHS leaders they should look to cuts made to the Home Office and defence budgets for inspiration, despite the starkly different contexts. One of her first decisions as prime minister was to delay the approval of a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point due to security concerns, only to announce that it would be going ahead months later. There is a justifiably growing sense that Mrs May’s preferred style of government is secretive, risk averse and inflexible. These may have been characteristics that served her well in her tenure as Britain’s longest serving home secretary in 50 years. But if she continues to shun openness and transparency, they may result in a shorter spell as prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/apr/22/halt-hinkley-point-brussels-state-aid-osborne-edf-nuclear-eu-competition-rules-greenpeace","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-22T13:21:30Z","webTitle":"Halt Hinkley Point until Brussels approves French state aid plans, Osborne told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/halt-hinkley-point-brussels-state-aid-osborne-edf-nuclear-eu-competition-rules-greenpeace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/halt-hinkley-point-brussels-state-aid-osborne-edf-nuclear-eu-competition-rules-greenpeace","fields":{"headline":"Halt Hinkley Point until Brussels approves French state aid plans, Osborne told","bodyText":"Greenpeace has written to George Osborne warning him not to allow the Hinkley Point C nuclear project to proceed until the European commission approves further planned support from the French state. The letter, which is signed jointly with the energy supplier Ecotricity, follows legal advice that plans for state help from France’sgovernment to enable EDF to continue with the reactor scheme could break European competition rules. The legal opinion was given to Greenpeace by three competition barristers from Monckton Chambers in London and came as EDF held a board meeting on Friday in Paris to discuss once again the controversial £18bn project in Somerset. “The only way Hinkley can be kept alive is on the life support machine of state aid. EDF, if it is to stay in business, needs a new vision which is not looking backwards,” said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK. “The UK government needs to stop penalising the UK renewable energy industry in favour of propping up an ailing state-owned nuclear industry in France.” Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, said it was time for everyone to realise that it was the end of the road for Hinkley Point. “Illegal state aid is one thing, and we’ll work with Greenpeace to challenge that if it happens, but it’s not just financial issues, there are technical problems with Hinkley Point too – EDF are yet to build one of these reactors and their first two attempts are, between them, 16 years late and billions over budget,” he added. The letter was also sent to Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change Secretary. Rudd and Osborne have been key figures in trying to steer investment into new nuclear plants. EDF, which is 85% owned by the French state, is struggling against a mountain of debt and has told ministers it will not build Hinkley unless it obtains help from France’s government. The country’s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, has talked about taking future dividends in shares rather than cash and a range of other options to lessen the financial burden on EDF. It is these proposals that the London barristers believe would need clearance from Brussels, a process that would subject Hinkley to further delays. Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the area covering the plant, said: “The numbers for the Hinkley deal have never stacked up and it is clear that the commercial case for this white elephant is dead. We have now a political battle where the stakes for both the UK and France are just too high to admit failure. But we cannot let this override EU rules on state aid or fair competition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/20/george-osborne-renationalisation-britain-nuclear-power-china-france-privatisation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Osborne is all for renationalisation – so long as the nation isn’t Britain | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/20/george-osborne-renationalisation-britain-nuclear-power-china-france-privatisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/20/george-osborne-renationalisation-britain-nuclear-power-china-france-privatisation","fields":{"headline":"Osborne is all for renationalisation – so long as the nation isn’t Britain","bodyText":"Steel yourself, for an unlikely source is about to spout a highly unfashionable idea. This week, George Osborne will come out for renationalisation. You won’t hear the N-word from his lips, of course. Nor shall the chancellor go full Corbyn and seize some of the FTSE’s crown jewels. Instead, you can expect something far more in keeping with the spirit of 21st-century Britain. The government will indeed put some of our most vital infrastructure under state control – but the states in question will be France and China. At some point during this week’s visit of president Xi Jinping – perhaps sandwiched between lunch at the palace and a trip to Chequers – Osborne shall confirm that nuclear plants will be built at Hinkley in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk, by the energy giant EDF, nearly 85% owned by the French government, and China. What’s more, Beijing will get a shot at designing and building its own nuclear facility at Bradwell in Essex. Even as that announcement is made with all the fanfare available to the British state, the promises of privatisation will be revealed as lies. What were voters guaranteed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major, as they flogged off electricity and the rest of our publicly-owned utilities? More competition, lower bills and greater investment: all the plump fruit of a more dynamic capitalism. A generation later and their children, David Cameron and Osborne, are handing Britain’s nuclear future back to the public sector – of two foreign countries – and paying handsomely for the privilege. Take Hinkley, which at £24.5bn will cost as much as the London Olympics, Crossrail and a new terminal at Heathrow put together. Osborne will proudly blare that taxpayers aren’t chipping in a penny towards the costs. True enough, but his civil servants will quietly admit that we are guaranteeing up to £17bn of the total cost. In the screwy logic of Britain’s renationalised capitalism, the public assumes the risk while the corporations get to scoop the profits. Because rest assured, there will be profits – all of us will be making sure of that. To secure EDF as a builder, Cameron guaranteed a fixed price for electricity from Hinkley of £92.50 per megawatt hour. That is around double the going rate for electricity on the wholesale markets, a price so high that equity analysts term it “financial insanity”. Change your supplier as often as you like, you and everyone else in Britain will be paying for that de facto subsidy in your electricity bills for decades to come. Britons will in effect be paying more for their energy so that French households can pay less. Indeed, so generous are the terms of this deal that the government of Austria is currently taking Britain to court on the grounds that it’s handing out state aid to EDF. Yes, you read that last sentence right: the UK stands accused of dispensing state aid – to another state. How many times have you read about some age-old manufacturer and thousands of jobs going down the swanee, while ministers wrung their hands over European state aid rules? Now we know that such rules can be tested – provided the recipient is headquartered not in Port Talbot, but Paris. When questioned about these eye-watering numbers, ministers will inevitably defend them as a price worth paying to stop the lights going out. But like the sanctity of the state-aid regulations, this is a bogeyman deployed to shut down conversation. True, Britain has a clapped-out generating system. Realistically, the price we face for that is not our TVs going dark in the middle of Gogglebox, or our smartphones no longer charging, but paying a lot more for our electricity. Except, with Hinkley, we’re guaranteed to be paying a lot more anyway. As James Meek points out in his prize-winning book Private Island, the publicly owned energy-generating system was in very good nick, enjoying both investment and domestic engineering expertise. A generation of privatisation has seen off both of those. Sue Ion, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering who has spent over 30 years in nuclear power, says, “We have no capacity to make a reactor design from scratch.” Hinkley’s boss, Nigel Cann, boasted to this paper last year of the thousands of local jobs his plant would bring. He gave just one example: “We’ve already seen a local food co-op … set up in preparation for feeding what we estimate to be the 25,000 people” who’ll move through the site. One insider predicts that the British will largely be employed “digging ditches, laying concrete and running the pie wagon”. The big-boy jobs will go to those calling the shots – that is, the French and the Chinese. A share-owning democracy, Thatcher promised, as she auctioned off BT. Britons were about to be put in charge of their economy. Another fib: in 1981, ordinary Britons owned over 25% of the stock market; they now hold less than half that. She offered a capitalism in which private firms took risks and reaped rewards, while the customer benefited. What she delivered was very different. A system in which you can’t get 3G on trains, can’t rely on broadband or buses in the countryside, and in which train operators and energy firms compete not on service – but on how many tariffs they can bamboozle customers with. In which parastatal organisations from France and China, Germany and the Netherlands take an easy clip from ordinary British customers and plough the bare minimum back. This isn’t a dynamic capitalism, it is lazy, arthritic and very expensive. And still Whitehall and Westminster, and their mini-mes in town halls up and down the country, carry on down the same road. Cameron proposes to sell anything left in the cupboard, even old student loans. Civil servants let Redcar and thousands of steel jobs go down the drain, as they lend millions to Roman Abramovich to keep his foreign steel plant going. Nuclear power is merely the punchline to this whole rotten joke. We won’t build it, we won’t own it, we certainly won’t control it. But we will pay for it: in lost jobs, in vanishing taxes, in whopping great winter fuel bills. • Do you have any questions for Aditya Chakrabortty? Would you like to find out more?

There can hardly have been more fluctuations at the Melbourne Stock Exchange as their games meshed angrily on a hot but not oppressive afternoon on Margaret Court Arena. Watson beat the No18 seed 6-3, 3-6, 6-0 and retired to the shade of the locker room to await the result of the match between the American Jennifer Brady and Belgium’s Maryna Zanevska, which was due to start on Court 5. This was Stosur’s third first-round loss in a row this year, after disappointments in Brisbane and Sydney. There is home pressure and there is outright phobia. Her record here suggests the latter might be her real problem. Whoever Watson plays next, meanwhile, she will have benefited from what was a tough mirror image of herself. They have different frailties. Where Watson’s problems accumulate in bunches of close, lost causes, Stosur explodes in bursts of rash shot-making, unable to control the vicious power that rolls through her muscular right arm. She struck 47 unforced errors to cancel out 35 winners and disintegrated in the third set. It made for an intriguing contest, with neither sure of dominance until Watson properly got going. But, even though she bagelled Stosur in the third, the set still ate up 48 minutes on the clock, as there were multiple deuce struggles all the way to the finish line. Oddly, although possibly a megawatt short of the Australian’s hitting capacity, Watson took the first set with the second of her six aces, which she slapped with intent down the middle. It was a wind farm up against a nuclear power station, though, as Stosur regularly belted her first serve 20 miles an hour faster than Watson’s second. Her challenge was to resist those lapses that have undone her in the past when in good positions. There was a smattering of British support to encourage her, but Stosur, naturally, was the crowd favourite – even though she was doomed to another losing effort on home soil. At times, it is easy to see how she beat Serena Williams to win the US Open on the night of her life six years ago. When she wraps her racket around a top-spun forehand and gets her radar right, there isn’t a player on the Tour who could conjure a worthwhile return. Unfortunately, she mixes winners with horror shots too often to cash in. She held through deuce at the start of the second, though, and remained calm to go 2-0 up, as Watson’s forehand, a model of consistency to that point, let her down on break point. The set got away from Watson just past the hour when Stosur slotted her fourth ace down the T, at just 105 mph but swerving away from the British No2. Stosur held through a tough deuce fight in the seventh game, Watson stayed in the set with her fifth ace but the Australian got over the line to force the decider Stosur did not fold, but her wild ground strokes grew wilder by the rally, and Watson just had to remain patient in the exchanges to get the job done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2019/feb/26/pound-brexit-delay-reports-mark-carney-jerome-powell-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-26T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"Pound hits 21-month high as Brexit delay looms - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/feb/26/pound-brexit-delay-reports-mark-carney-jerome-powell-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2019/feb/26/pound-brexit-delay-reports-mark-carney-jerome-powell-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Pound hits 21-month high as Brexit delay looms - as it happened","bodyText":"Time for a recap The pound has surged after Theresa May finally conceded that MPs should be given a vote on whether to extend Article 50, rather than crash out of the EU without a deal in a month’s time. Sterling has jumped by around 1% against the euro to a 21-month high, around €1.164, and to a five-month high against the US dollar at $1.324. City traders are calculating that a disorderly Brexit is less likely, while there’s still a chance that May’s deal is eventually approved by MPs (although there wasn’t much support for it in parliament today). Business leaders, though, fear that they could faces another cliff edge this summer - if MPs only approve a short extension. The Bank of England is getting ready for market volatility, by launching new weekly liquidity auctions. They will help banks and building societies get their hands on sterling, in the event of a squeeze after a no-deal Brexit. BoE governor Mark Carney warned that growth would suffer if Britain crashes out without a transition deal, adding that the country doesn’t have enough warehouses to handle stock-piling demands. In an prize-example of non-preparedness, Britain has discovered that it doesn’t even have enough suitable pallets to trade with the EU, if it leaves without a deal. In Washington, Jerome Powell has emphasised that the US Federal Reserve will be patient when considering future interest rate moves. Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the action on Brexit: Goodnight! GW Jay Powell has tried to sidestep a question about political interference. Asked if anybody at the White House had communicated with him “directly or indirectly” about interest rates, Powell would only say that it wasn’t appropriate to discuss private conversations with any other government officials. Obviously the Federal Reserve is meant to be independent, and free from meddling. However, that ship sailed once Donald Trump started blasting the Fed’s politics on Twitter. Sterling’s surge has dragged down stock prices of UK multinationals who have large overseas earnings, such as British American Tobacco (down 2%). This has helped the FTSE 100 to underperform other European markets. The blue-chip index has closed down 32 points, while the German DAC gained 0.3% and France’s CAC also closed higher. Back in Washington, Jerome Powell has poured some cold water on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). This is the idea that a government which controls its own currency can always fund its spending plans, regardless of deficit levels, and isn’t reliant on borrowing in the markets. It’s becoming a hot topic, as US politicians push policies such as the New Green Deal. Powell tells the Senate banking committee that he hasn’t seen a detailed explanation of how MMT would work in practice, but that the idea that deficits don’t matter is wrong. Here’s Guy Foster, Brewin Dolphin’s Head of Research, on today’s Brexit developments: “Theresa May must feel more like a seamstress than a prime minister given how much time she spends trying to knit together opposing camps within her party. By offering a short extension she has effectively weakened the means by which Parliament could demand a long extension. There will be no majority for a no deal Brexit whereas an extension should pass.” Back in the markets, sterling is banging out new highs against other major currencies. The pound has now hit €1.166 against the euro, up 1% or 1.3 eurocents today. That’s a fresh 21-month high against the single currency. Sterling is also rampant against the US dollar, up more than one and a half cents to $1.326. That’s the highest since September 2018. This comes after several prominent MPs welcomed Theresa May’s pledge for a vote to extend Article 50 next month, if her deal doesn’t pass. It appears that the Cooper-Letwin amendment, to formally rule out a No-Deal Brexit, might not be voted on tomorrow after all, as it’s no longer needed. My colleague Jessica Elgot explains: Jay Powell is now giving Senators a lesson on the US labor market, and the risk that people earn less in a new job than they’d get on welfare: Jay Powell has warned the Senate that it would be a very serious mistake not to raise the USA debt ceiling. The Fed chair says it would be a “very big deal” if America was unable to repay its bills, causing serious negative impact to the economy. Jay Powell is now taking questions from members of the Senate banking committee in Washington. On the economic outlook, he says the Fed wants to use its tools to sustain the current expansion. On energy, he says America’s shale industry is a “real positive”. Because shale producers pump more oil when prices rise, it acts as a “shock-absorber” to prevent inflation getting out of control as in the 1970. On trade, Powell warns that “uncertainty is the enemy of business.” The Fed has been hearing for months that the uncertainty over America’s trade links (due to the dispute with China) has had some impact on confidence. And on US financial stability, he says America’s banks are strong - with no bank failures in 2018. Jay Powell has also taken the opportunity to tell Congress that America has too much economic inequality, and too much debt too. He’s challenging Senators to do more to help their citizens, saying: Productivity growth, which is what drives rising real wages and living standards over the longer term, has been too low. Likewise, in contrast to 25 years ago, labor force participation among prime-age men and women is now lower in the United States than in most other advanced economies. Other longer-run trends, such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes, also remain important challenges. And it is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. As a nation, addressing these pressing issues could contribute greatly to the longer-run health and vitality of the U.S. economy. Fed chair Jerome Powell also cites Brexit as a key source of uncertainty that could threaten financial markets. He tells the Senate banking committee that the mood in the world economy has darkened: Financial markets became more volatile toward year-end, and financial conditions are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe. And uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve. Newsflash: America’s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is starting to give his bi-annual testimony to the US Senate. And the top line is that Powell is reiterating that the Federal Reserve won’t rush to raise US interest rates. Echoing the message from the Fed’s last meeting, a month ago, Powell says: In January, with inflation pressures muted, the FOMC determined that the cumulative effects of these developments, along with ongoing government policy uncertainty, warranted taking a patient approach with regard to future policy changes. Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve. Powell also says that the US jobs market remains ‘strong’, with low-skilled workers getting the highest wage growth recently. Brexit has already cast a cloud over UK investors, who are now the gloomiest in Europe, according to new research from UBS Global Wealth Management. UBS has found that City investors are much more anxious than those in rival financial centres like Frankfurt or Paris, even though the eurozone economy has weakened in recent quarters. Nick Tucker, Head of UK Domestic at UBS Wealth Management, explains: “As we get closer to the UK’s official departure from the EU at the end of March, this survey shows that political turbulence is dragging on investor sentiment in the UK compared to the rest of the region. UK investors seem to have dramatically lowered expectations for 2019 in almost every sense, from expected financial returns to their outlook for the economy.” “From our conversations with clients up and down the country, we know that investors are anxious. Here are the main findings from the report: The domestic political environment is the top concern for over half (55%) of UK investors, compared to 43% among EMEA investors Less than one third of UK investors (28%) are now optimistic in their outlook for the European economy over next 12 months, compared to over half of EMEA investors (53%) A quarter of business owners are pessimistic about the outlook for their business in 2019, compared to 12% of EMEA investors Investors advised to maintain exposure to sterling and UK assets at benchmark levels Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects that today’s offer is just another attempt by the PM to get her deal over the line: The boss of Vauxhall’s parent company, PSA, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to ‘unpopular’ decisions, such as job cuts and factory closures. Carlos Tavares warned this morning: “We can go on the dark side, say, well, perhaps you have to shut down plants and things like that. Well, if we have to make unpopular decisions we will.” Tavares also warned that a disorderly Brexit would disrupt supply chains at Vauxhall, which employs hundreds of people in Luton, and at Ellesmere Port in the North West. Here’s Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General: “Moves to avert no deal in March are essential. There are now proposals from Parliament and Government. But they are just one step. To avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate. Compromise is the only way.” Claire Walker, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), has warned business leaders to keep preparing for all Brexit possibilities: “The overriding priority is still to assure businesses and communities that an unwanted ‘no deal’ scenario will not happen by default on March 29th. “Businesses still need to ensure they are preparing for all possible scenarios and government and its agencies must provide clear, precise and accurate information for all eventualities.” Edwin Morgan, interim Director General of the Institute of Directors, has welcomed Theresa May’s commitment to let MPs vote on extending Article 50. Morgan also warned that most UK firms simply aren’t ready for a no-deal Brexit (not least if they need a pallet to ship goods to Europe!). “The Prime Minister is right to put her cards on the table for what happens if she fails to get approval for a withdrawal deal by 12 March. Parliament must feel and accept the weight of responsibility that is on their shoulders. The message from our members is clear, nearly 80% would choose to avoid a no-deal outcome. Too much information about that scenario is still missing – including from our own Government – for firms to be ready in a few short weeks. “Seeing the impasse continue may not be comfortable for businesses, but a disorderly exit could bring unbearable disruption for firms in sectors from farming to finance, manufacturing to business services, across the UK. It is a long time since we have been in a world of easy choices, and while an extension is not an end in itself, it may become a necessity to achieve an orderly exit.” Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has put his finger on the problem with May’s announcement -- a short A50 extension creates the risk of crashing out in June, rather than March. The pound wobbled during Theresa May’s statement, as the PM made it clear that she didn’t want to see Brexit delayed - even though she’s finally accepted that it could be pushed beyond 29th March. But it’s still clinging onto its 21-month high against the euro, at €1.162, and a four-month high against the US dollar at $1.32. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says May has pushed UK’s fate onto the cliff edge: She has said ‘chose between my deal or delay the Brexit’. This political circus has become a real joke. Investors do not need uncertainty and there was a lot of optimism in the market because investors were thinking that no deal scenario is off the table, but now, it seems like it is still on the table. And as Sky’s Faisal Islam points out, UK businesses won’t relish the prospect of more uncertainty. Theresa May is giving a Brexit statement to the House of Commons right now. And the Big News is that parliament will hold up to THREE votes on Brexit in two week’s time. May outlines her plan: The government will hold a second meaningful vote on the PM’s Withdrawal Deal by 12 March at the latest. If the government doesn’t win a meaningful vote, it will table a motion on 13 March to ask whether the House supports leaving the EU on 29th March without a deal. If MPs reject leaving without a deal, the government will hold a vote on a “short, limited” extension to Article 50 on March 14th. But the PM also warns that she doesn’t want to see Article 50 extended, saying a short extension would create an even sharper cliff edge this summer. And a long extension would mean taking part in the next elections for the European Parliament in May (hardly what Leave voters wanted). Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: With Mark Carney’s hearing now over, Royal Bank of Canada have spotted that the probability of Brexit happening on time has fallen to just 14% (as implied by odds on Betfair, anyway). Instead, an exit in April-June now looks most likely, followed by no Brexit at all. RBC’s Adam Cole adds that a 2nd referendum looks more likely, but still isn’t at all certain, writing: There is little doubt that Labour support for a second referendum is a necessary condition for such a referendum happening, but it is far from sufficient. That the implied probability of second referendum happening has also risen (second chart; now around 33%) is not surprising, but again there are limits to how far this can run. In particular, it seems highly unlikely that an amendment that backed a second referendum would make it through the Commons, given that there is little support on the government benches and many Labour MPs in Brexit-voting constituencies are also opposed. Q: If the pound fell after a no-deal Brexit, wouldn’t that boost growth? Mark Carney stamps, firmly, on the notion that crashing out of the EU would be good for the economy. The role of a flexible exchange rate is to act as a shock-absorber. A no-deal, no transition Brexit would be a shock, it would be a negative shock. He cites BoE forecasts that a smooth transition to WTO trading terms would lead to the pound plunging by between 8.5% and 10%, and a 2.5% drop in GDP compared to last November’s forecasts. So the weaker currency is “an offset, but it is swamped, overwhelmed by the loss of trade access,” the governor explains. Asked about consumer spending, Mark Carney replies that consumers are making fewer big-ticket purchases such as houses and cars, but overall consumption growth has held up well. He also says the Bank isn’t picking up any material sign that households are stockpiling ahead of Brexit (some families have been stocking up on pharmaceuticals products, food, and pet supplies). Q: Consumer confidence and spending, especially in Leave areas, has been consistently more positive than economist forecasts. Does that suggest economists are too pessimistic about Brexit, or has the impact of Brexit simply not hit people yet? Governor Carney says we don’t know what form Brexit will take, and how long it will take to get there, so you can’t make that judgement yet. Heads-up: Just fixed a typo in that 11.17am post -- Mark Carney predicted that the Bank’s GROWTH forecasts will be lower after a no-deal Brexit. Q: Why are some businesses much more worried about Brexit than others? MPC member Dr Gertjan Vlieghe explains that the effects are very unevenly distributed across the economy. A specialist manufacturer which buys basic raw materials, such as chemicals or steel, and turns it into a high-value product won’t be particularly affected by Brexit. But Brexit is an “existential” issue to a company that is part of a major automotive supply chain, Vleighe adds. Q: Are there enough warehouses to handle the stock-piling necessary for a no-deal Brexit? No there are not, Mark Carney replies, saying that one of the issues facing UK firms is a shortage of warehouse space. There’s a limit to warehousing capacity, and also how much you can stockpile to keep factories running, he adds, citing the just-in-time “lean supply chains” used by the car industry and aerospace manufacturers. Q: So we’re looking at chaos? Carney declines to use that particular word, saying only that it would be an economic shock. Mark Carney then warns MPs that growth will suffer if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. The Treasury Committee is now grilling governor Mark Carney over the prospect of Brexit delay. Carney warns that simply kicking the can down the road isn’t as good for the economy as reaching a deal, saying: There’s a big difference between an extension of Article 50, even a long extension, and an agreement with a transition to a known end stage. Wherever we’re headed, it would serve the economy well to have a transition period to that new world, so that people knew soon where they’re headed, businesses could reorganise their affairs and get ready for this new world, and government could finish its tasks. Carney also points out that Brexit uncertainty will linger well beyond Britain’s day of departure (as Westminster will need to negotiate a future relationship with Brussels, and strike new trade deals with the rest of the world). Back in parliament, Charlie Elphicke MP asks Mark Carney about a recent speech calling Brexit an ‘acid test’ for the new world order. Q: How can Brexit could be used to enhance Britain’s openness, competitiveness and productivity, and rebalance the economy? “Fantastic”, mutters Carney, when faced with this poser. But the governor makes some good points - about the important of having flexibility to set your own rules on financial stability, rather than simply being a rule taker. But Carney then takes a much wider view, telling the Treasury Committee that there needs to be a “reinvestment of economic gains, so that everyone moves up”. He cites the rise in fintech, saying: How do you provide a framework for new financial technology, not just to benefit the City, but also to help small and medium enterprises in Dover, Deal, Dulwich or... Dunfermline. Don’t forget Doncaster, Darlington, and Dorchester, the MPs chant back. Carney’s bigger point is that globalisation is creating problems, so politicians needs to redistribute the gains made in recent decades. He sites the US-China trade war, saying: The tensions in globalisation are actually starting to affect the global outlook. They are bigger, they’re structural, they require a more deliberate response, and it has to balance some element of redistribution and reinvestment of the gains of globalisation. As well as getting the balance between democratic accountability and standards that are high enough - whether for financial stability, product safety, or environmental standards - that we have confidence that we can trade freely. Carney adds that he doesn’t expect a global recession. But the biggest risk that could trigger such a downturn is around globalisation. My personal view is that the challenges around trade globally have structural drivers. The solution isn’t a textbook solution that ‘free trade is good’. DOUBLE BOOM! Sterling has just hit a four-month high against the US dollar, touching $1.323 for the first time since mid-October. BOOM! The pound has just hit a 21-month high against the euro, as speculation of a Brexit delay sweeps through the City. Sterling is trading at €1.162 for the first time since May 2017, up almost one eurocent or 0.8% this morning. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the the pound is soaring on hopes of a soft Brexit, or a second referendum. Erlam explains that a hard Brexit looks less likely, if Theresa May agrees to take no-deal off the table at today’s cabinet meeting, The pound is tearing higher on Tuesday as we await another vote in Parliament tomorrow – albeit not on May’s deal, again. The decision comes as the opposition Labour Party threw its support behind a second referendum if it couldn’t get its own Brexit deal over the line and Theresa May opened the door to an extension, having failed to secure amendments with the EU in time for tomorrow’s vote. These are all bullish scenarios for the pound, despite remaining the unlikely options, not only for what they put on the table but also for who they put pressure on. The ERG – a group of hardline Brexiteers – many of whom favour a harder Brexit and some no-deal, will not be pleased with the recent developments with another referendum jeopardising the whole process and an extension threatening it. That may force them to reluctantly support May’s deal, when push comes to shove. Sterling has also risen further against the US dollar, over $1.32 for the first time in a month. Our Politics Live blog is covering all the action from Westminster: Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan brings up another important issue - diversity at the Bank of England. She reminds Mark Carney that he told the Bank’s Court that there was a particular problem with retaining ethnic minority staff, who are underrepresented at every level of the central bank. Morgna also cites a report in the Times last week that BAME staff were more critical of the Bank’s culture -- citing inappropriate language and behaviour, and problems in progressing within the Bank. She says BAME employees perceived a lack of transparency in hiring and firing, and were critical of the Bank’s narrow recruitment base. This is not good. Carney replies that the Bank management take the issue of diversity seriously, and have made considerable progress. In the last five years (since Carney arrived), the proportion of BAME staff at the BoE has risen from 13% to 19%, and from 2% to 5% of senior management. Last year, BAME recruits made up 39% of new hires, Carney adds, citing blind recruitment, inclusive management policies, and pooled hiring decisions. But, he also concedes that the experience for BAME colleagues is “notably different, notably worse, than for other colleagues”. “We’re not satisfied with the progress made. It’s not just about numbers. Governor Mark Carney adds that the Bank will provide ‘all the stimulus it can’ if Britain leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal. Interest rates could either rise or fall in that scenario, he adds, pointing out that a no-deal Brexit will probably be inflationary (as the pound would surely plunge, pushing up import costs). Q: Is the Bank of England more likely to raise, or lower, interest rates after a no-deal Brexit, asks Nicky Morgan MP. It’s clear that the Bank’s top policymakers are split on this issue. MPC member Gertjan Vleighe argues that borrowing costs won’t go up. He tells the Treasury committee that the shock to consumer confidence will be so severe that the Bank will either leave policy unchanged, or cut rates. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden isn’t convinced, though. He fears a supply-shock if Britain crashes out of the EU, with port disruption making imports scarcer. That would drive up inflation, as businesses and consumers scrapped for goods. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee now. And he’s started with some news -- the Bank is preparing to pump more liquidity into the UK financial system if needed. With Brexit tensions mounting, the Bank will now hold liquidity auctions every week, rather than monthly, from the start of March until the end of April. Carney tells the committee that this is a prudent and precautionary move. It will allow around 100 banks and building societies to get extra cash in sterling, in return for handing the BoE eligible collateral (a range of financial securities). The Bank of England stands ready to provide liquidity in all major currencies. This would be valuable if the financial system seized up after a disorderly Brexit. Carney insists that the Bank isn’t seeing any liquidity stresses in the market, and that the move is part of “normal contingency planning”. Carney is appearing along with deputy governor Dave Ramsden and monetary policy committee members Jan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. We’ll watch out for any major developments. Just in: The richest households in the UK saw their income grow last year, while the poorest families got poorer. That’s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has published new income distribution data this morning. It shows that the average income of the poorest fifth of the population contracted by 1.6%, mainly driven by fall in the average value of cash benefits. The average income of the richest fifth, on the other hand, increased by 4.7% due largely to increases in wages. The ONS adds: Over the slightly longer term, it is the average income of the poorest fifth that has risen the most, up 11.6% since 2008, whilst the income of the richest fifth has risen 4.9% over the same period. That’s all well and good... however, a 11.6% increase on a tiny household budget is rather smaller than a 4.9% boost to a City bankers’ wallet. The pound is holding onto its earlier gains, still trading at a one-month high against the euro (at €1.158) and the US dollar ($1.316). Michael Brown, senior analyst at currency exchange firm Caxton FX, says the prospect of a Brexit extension is supporting sterling: The pound’s gains are a result of markets beginning to price in an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, with reports this morning that the Prime Minister is set to discuss the matter with Cabinet before laying a motion in the Commons this afternoon. Though a delay is simply pushing back the exit date, and doesn’t solve anything itself, markets are taking solace in the fact that such a move would delay a ‘cliff-edge’ no-deal scenario. Confirmation of such a delay would likely strengthen the pound further in the near-term, though political headwinds remain including the opposition Labour Party calling for a 2nd Brexit referendum In a worrying example of Brexit non-planning, Britain doesn’t have the right sort of pallets to keep trading with the EU if it leaves without a deal. According to Business Insider, the UK government is due to hold emergency talks with industry leaders today after discovering this hitch. The problem is that the EU insists that all pallets entering the bloc from third-countries are heat-treated, to prevent any nasty pests or microbes getting in. That’s not a requirement today (on the grounds that EU countries have similar biological life). So there’s going to be an unseemly scramble for any scarce certified pallets soon, unless Brexit is delayed or Theresa May’s deal is voted through. BI’s Adam Payne says this has come as a nasty shock to the government. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has arranged for a conference call with various figures to take place on Tuesday to discuss the alarming pallet shortage, with just 31 days until Brexit day on March 29. “It is the tiny, procedural, mundane-seeming stuff that will absolutely trip people up,” one industry figure briefed by Theresa May’s government told BI, adding that the country was “not even remotely ready” for no-deal. There’s really no excuse for DEFRA not spotting the pallet issue earlier. Last October, Universal Pallets warned that this issue would cause delays for exporters, as it takes time to heat-treat pallets and get them stamped. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is urging the government to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Marshall warns that many UK companies - and the government itself - simply aren’t ready for a disorderly exit. “At this pivotal moment, the government must take decisive steps to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit would cause to business and the economy in just a month’s time. “It is time to be honest. Government and its agencies are not prepared for a ‘no deal’ exit on 29th March. Neither are many businesses. “The overriding priority must be to assure businesses, employees, investors and communities that an unwanted ‘no deal’ scenario will not be allowed to happen by default on March 29th.” Two weeks ago, the Bank of England reported that HALF UK companies hasn’t drawn up contingency plans for no-deal.... The CBI’s chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, has warned MPs that they need to use any Brexit delay wisely: Bullish traders are piling into the pound this morning, lured by the prospect of a Brexit delay, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Sterling has rallied on movements in the political space that have encouraged the bulls. First, Labour is now backing a second referendum - one u-turn. If anything, though, this just hints at the party worrying about an exodus to The Independent Group. Secondly, and more importantly, there appears to be building pressure on the prime minister to take no deal off the table - another u-turn. If no deal is abandoned, it would likely entail a delay to Brexit, and whilst assuaging concerns about crashing out without a deal in place, it would not remove all the uncertainty. A key cabinet meeting today will reveal all – we hope. Ouch. UK engineering services group Babcock has warned the City that Brexit will cost it millions of pounds, every year. That’s on top of a £10m bill for restructuring its European aerial business, which provides emergency medical and firefighting services. This will allow it to meet EU rules on ownership, and flying rights, once Britain has left the EU. In a statement to shareholders, the aerospace and defence company says: The UK exiting the EU has resulted in additional costs as we restructure our aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements. There is a one-off tax cost of around £10 million this year and we estimate that additional ongoing costs related to the operation of the new structures will be around £10 million per year. Babcock’s Emergency Medical Services provides air ambulance operators in Europe, and also Australia, and can provide its own doctors and nurses in a emergency. It also operates an Aerial Firefighting division -- increasingly in demand, as climate change leads to more wildfires. Shares in the company, which also refits ships and submarines and decommissions nuclear power stations, have fallen over 3% following today’s news. Roland Rudd, who chairs the People’s Vote campaign, believes a second Brexit referendum is looking more likely. The new Independent Group are also backing the plan: But... some Labour MPs representing constituencies who voted Leave in June 2016 wouldn’t support another referendum, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh tweeted last night: The Financial Times also expects MPs to be offered the chance to delay Brexit, saying: If MPs reject a revised deal in a vote set to take place before March 12, Mrs May will then offer a vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or take a “short extension” of the Article 50 exit process. A Brexit delay now looks that “most likely path forward”, says Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada. He told City clients this morning: The PM will open the way for a “short” Brexit delay at a cabinet meeting this morning, according to reports, and outline the terms in her statement to the Commons this afternoon, ahead of tomorrow’s debate. If the meaningful vote by (likely on) March 12 fails, MPs would be given a second vote on leaving with no deal or delaying Brexit which would almost certainly result in delay and this now appears the most likely path forward. We note, however, that proxy markets were yesterday attaching only a 20% probability to Brexit happening “on time.” The pound has jumped to its highest level in four weeks this morning, amid speculation that Britain’s departure from the European Union could be delayed. Sterling has rallied half a eurocent against the euro to €1.158, its highest level since 25th January. That’s nearly a 10-month high. The pound is also strengthening against the US dollar, up half a cent to $1.315, for the first time since the end of January. Last night, The Sun newspaper reported that Theresa May will today propose to Cabinet that she formally rules out a No Deal Brexit on March 29, opening the door to a delay. That could delay Brexit by weeks, or even months, if parliament fails to back her Withdrawal Agreement in the next few weeks. More here: Theresa May to propose to Cabinet today that she formally rules out No-Deal Brexit This would be a dizzying u-turn by the PM, who has long argued that Britain is leaving on the 29th March, come what may. But several cabinet ministers have been piling heavy pressure on May to categorically rule out a no-deal Brexit. Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark are all demanding that May rules out the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of next month. May insisted yesterday that a delay wouldn’t resolve anything, but the PM risks seeing the issue taken out of her hands. Tomorrow, MPs could pass a cross-party amendment laid by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin and Labour’s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. News that the opposition Labour Party have also shifted their position, and could back a public vote on Brexit has also caught the City’s attention -- as it potentially increases the changes that Britain doesn’t leave at all. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reported last night: Jeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party’s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. The decision to give the party’s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two top central bankers will be in the spotlight today, facing questions about monetary policy and the state of the economy. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due before the Treasury Committee at 10am GMT, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and external policymakers Gertjan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. They’ll be quizzed about the Bank’s latest Inflation Report, which slashed UK growth forecasts and warned a no-deal Brexit could cause a recession. MPs may also ask the Bank about the prospects of interest rate rises over the next couple of years, and the impact of the recent global slowdown on the UK. A few hours later, Carney’s US counterpart will also be facing lawmakers at the Senate. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s bi-annual testimony will be extremely closely watched by investors, for any clues on whether the Fed has ended its rate-hiking cycle. He’ll also be asked about plans to trim the Fed’s balance sheet, unwinding its massive stimulus programme, and the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war on the US economy. Markets have risen strongly since the Fed’s last meeting, at the end of January, when it was surprisingly dovish about monetary policy plans; Powell’s comments today could easily move the dollar and US Treasury bond prices. The markets will also be chewing through new US housing data, and consumer confidence report. Plus, UK housebuilder Persimmon is updating the market - reporting that pre-tax profts have jumped to nearly £1.1bn - up from £970m last year. This is just days after it emerged Persimmon (under fire for paying bosses huge bonuses) could be banned from the government’s Help to Buy subsidy scheme.

More than £1bn of future investment in renewable energy projects disappeared over the course of 2016, the Green Alliance found when it analysed the government’s latest pipeline of major infrastructure plans. Investment in wind, solar, biomass power and waste-to-energy projects will decline by 95% between 2017 and 2020, it added. While a slowdown in green energy investment had been expected after ministers cut several subsidy schemes over the last 18 months, the figures lay bare the dramatic extent of the decline. “This cliff edge needs to be avoided if the UK is to meet its world leading carbon budgets and Paris agreement pledge,” Green Alliance said in its analysis. Shortly after the EU referendum, the government committed to cutting carbon emissions by 57% by 2030 on 1990 levels, but has so far failed to spell out how it will support low-carbon energy, such as offshore windfarms, beyond 2020. “Renewables will be cheaper than new fossil power stations by 2025 at the latest if we allow companies to build, learn, and cut their costs. But the government has been holding back the final bit of support needed to make renewables subsidy free. It’s also blocked the cheapest renewables from being built,” said Dustin Benton, acting deputy director at Green Alliance, referring to the government ending subsidies for onshore wind. “Unsurprisingly, the result is a 95% fall in investment.” The thinktank’s analysis found that high carbon infrastructure, which it defines as fossil fuel power stations, airports and road building, was faring little better. For the first time since 2012, high carbon investment had stopped growing, and will be down by two-thirds by 2020. “The picture of private sector investment is very clear: it is rapidly moving away from high carbon infrastructure. In contrast, public sector high carbon investment is rising, although slowly,” the authors wrote. RenewableUK, which represents the wind power industry, said the government needed to set out its vision on energy to enable investor confidence. Emma Pinchbeck, the group’s executive director, said: “The energy sector is changing. The infrastructure pipeline shows that the private sector understands the smart money is on the renewables industry – that is why they are moving from high carbon assets to low carbon ones.” But the infrastructure pipeline showed the government had managed to cut £2bn from the cost of decommissioning old nuclear power plants. The thinktank said that was good news as it could free up money to spend on encouraging people to switch to lower carbon heating, which ministers have admitted is progressing slowly. A government spokesman said: “We are fully committed to a low-carbon future and the Office for Budget Responsibility recently projected that £8.4bn will be spent on renewable projects in the UK in 2020/21. “We are one of the best countries in the world at tackling climate change with £52bn invested in renewable projects in the UK since 2010. Last November we reaffirmed our commitment to spend £730m of annual support on renewable electricity projects over this parliament.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/04/french-presidential-election-how-the-candidates-compare","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-04T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"French presidential election: how the candidates compare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/french-presidential-election-how-the-candidates-compare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/04/french-presidential-election-how-the-candidates-compare","fields":{"headline":"French presidential election: how the candidates compare","bodyText":"Voters cast their ballots in the first round of the French presidential election on 23 April, with candidates ranging from far right to hard left vying to reach a second round run-off and, from there, the Elysée Palace.

As Corbyn made clear he did not believe his leadership contributed to Labour’s byelection defeat in Copeland, Miliband said he was “deeply concerned that Labour is further from power than at any stage in my lifetime”. In an interview with the Times on Saturday, the 51-year-old former foreign secretary said Labour’s shift to the left was a mistake. “The tempting thing to say is that it’s a mistake because it won’t get us elected,” he said. “But for people like me it’s a mistake because it won’t address the challenges of the country. This isn’t just an electability question, it’s a question of substance. I think one can achieve more radical and substantive change through a different set of positions.” Elsewhere in the interview, he said: “I don’t think this is just a repeat of the 1980s. We have to really understand the historic nature of the challenge that we have to face.” The former MP for South Shields, who was foreign secretary under Gordon Brown, has been the president and chief executive of the US-based International Rescue Committee, one of the world’s largest aid agencies, since 2013. Spinwatch, which campaigns for greater transparency in public and corporate life, notes that the IRC has long been accused of being an instrument of US foreign policy, has documented links to the CIA, and has been an advocate of military intervention - claims the organisation denies. In the interview, Miliband focused on the IRC’s work with refugees and criticised the populist anti-immigration policies of Donald Trump. “The last few years have seen the reaction against the refugee crisis where the sense is that the only solution is partition, separation – to keep them out,” he said. “I think that is a threat.” Miliband made a play for the Labour leadership in 2010, but was narrowly beaten by his younger, more leftwing brother, Ed. Despite a leftwing surge in Labour membership, Miliband said he believed there was still the chance of a revival in Blairite-style politics in the UK, pointing to the rise of Emmanuel Macron in France as evidence. Asked if he would ever make a return to Westminster politics, Miliband said he felt he was having a greater impact working with the IRC than he would doing something else. “I’m conscious that [Arsenal manager] Arsène Wenger says never resign an old player, so that’s in my head,” he said. “I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do. It’s hard to see – but what’s the point of saying never?” Labour’s loss in Copeland on Thursday prompted a new round of infighting in the party. That byelection, and another in Stoke, which Labour held, came as a result of the resignations of two Labour MPs, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, who were both strong critics of Corbyn. Reports suggest Labour MPs are despondent about the Copeland result, but most are choosing to remain quiet after an attempt to oust Corbyn last summer saw him secure a second resounding leadership election victory. Even allies have argued that Corbyn must take some responsibility for the Copeland result. The general secretary of the Unison union, Dave Prentis, said no one could objectively argue the byelection results were good for Labour. “While it was pleasing to see Ukip put in its place, Stoke should never have been in doubt and the result in Copeland was disastrous,” he said. “The blame for these results does not lie solely with Jeremy Corbyn, but he must take responsibility for what happens next.” Corbyn received support, however, from Mick Whelan, the Aslef general secretary and chair of the Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation. He said the “uncertainty” caused by last year’s leadership challenge and “misinformation” about Labour’s stance on nuclear power were to blame for the Copeland defeat. Whelan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I do wonder, shall we ask ourselves the question: ‘How bad would it have been if we didn’t have Jeremy?’ That’s the question we should be asking ourselves.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/30/nuclear-power-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T23:07:19Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Hinkley Point | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/nuclear-power-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/30/nuclear-power-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Hinkley Point","bodyText":"Eight long years in the making: the plans to build Hinkley Point C have been beset by delays and difficulties. In recent months, the government has pressed French company EDF for a decision to proceed, while EDF has resisted setting a timetable. But last Thursday, the tables turned dramatically: EDF finally signalled its go-ahead, then just hours later, the government announced it would delay its final decision on the project. The delay was not without risks. It has certainly ruffled diplomatic feathers, given China’s significant stake in the project. And it will create yet more uncertainty in an energy industry in which certainty is critical to fostering long-term investment. But it was the right decision, in light of serious concerns about whether the project represents value for money and the security risks of depending on Chinese investment for a project so critical to long-term national security. Yet the decisions that lie ahead will be even more difficult. Will the government kick the Hinkley decision into the long grass, as it has done with other difficult infrastructure decisions, such as additional airport capacity? Or will it use the coming months to reconsider how nuclear power fits into a long-term energy strategy? Energy policy has long been in a mess. Britain faces the same conundrum as every other country: how to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to meet climate change targets, while ensuring both energy security and affordability against a backdrop of increasing demand for electricity over the next two decades. There are no magic bullets. The only way to achieve this is through a long-term strategy, but this has been utterly lacking. Renewables have a critical role to play, yet David Cameron’s government created huge uncertainty by phasing out many subsidies at short notice. But renewables cannot provide the stable excess capacity needed to deal with short-term surges in demand. Carbon capture and storage is also important, although, again, Cameron pledged to invest £1bn in it, only to scrap support for the scheme a few months ago. And investment in domestic and industrial energy efficiency is needed to help reduce demand, but the government has also underinvested here. But these will not together be enough: without new investment in nuclear energy, it is unlikely that Britain will meet its decarbonisation targets. While nuclear has a bad reputation, the safety risks of newer technologies are often overblown and, as environmentalists such as George Monbiot have argued, the risks of climate change are even greater. No nuclear power stations have been built in Britain since the 1990s and half of our current nuclear capacity will be retired by 2025. It is true that there appear to be serious issues with the type of nuclear reactor planned for Hinkley – projects in France and Finland have been beset by delays and spiralling costs – but other new nuclear technologies are even less developed than the Hinkley reactor. While small modular reactors have potential, they would also require upfront state subsidy. There is no cheap or easy option when it comes to nuclear. Yet it is clear that Hinkley, as currently conceived, represents a terrible deal for taxpayers. Because nuclear power has such significant upfront costs, it will always require some form of state subsidy. By far the most efficient way is for the government to issue nuclear bonds, taking advantage of cheap borrowing costs. But the government’s illogical aversion to borrowing means it is subsidising Hinkley by guaranteeing the price paid for the electricity it produces over 35 years. The price has already been set; in 2013, the total value of this subsidy was estimated to be £6bn. Today, in the wake of falling wholesale energy prices, this has ballooned to £30bn. And by relying on Chinese state investment rather than UK government borrowing, it opens the project up to serious security concerns. This saga crystallises many of the failings of British industrial policy over the last 30 years. The lack of a long-term strategy is replicated across other strategic sectors of the economy, from biotech to advanced manufacturing. Unlike our competitors, the government has not proved adept at identifying and nurturing sectors in which we have emerging comparative advantage – not by picking winners, but through policies that enable the top companies in these sectors to flourish. It is also a reminder of the government’s terrible track record of structuring public-private partnerships that represent good value for money for taxpayers. Too often, negotiations are driven by the government’s desire to keep investment off the balance sheet. Theresa May has signalled a new approach to industrial policy, which is to be welcomed. But if it is to have a hope of succeeding, she must apply the lessons of Hinkley to the whole of British industrial policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2017/sep/11/markets-rise-risk-appetite-returns-wind-power-euro-pound-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T21:40:01Z","webTitle":"Stock markets hit record highs as fears over North Korea and Irma recede - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/sep/11/markets-rise-risk-appetite-returns-wind-power-euro-pound-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/sep/11/markets-rise-risk-appetite-returns-wind-power-euro-pound-live","fields":{"headline":"Stock markets hit record highs as fears over North Korea and Irma recede - as it happened","bodyText":"A late PS: America’s S&amp;P 500 index has closed at a new all-time high tonight. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1%, or 26 points, to 2,488.11 points, led by insurers, other financial firms, and tech stocks. The Dow Jones posted its biggest one-day jump since March. The rally was driven by relief that Hurricane Irma appears to have caused less damage than the worst-case scenarios. Marketwatch’s Barbara Kollmeyer sums up the day: Wall Street optimism was underpinned by Hurricane Irma delivering a less forceful hit on Florida than expected and North Korea failing to conduct another nuclear missile test over the weekend, reviving investor appetite for assets perceived as risky, such as equities. But...Irma has still caused terrible damage to areas such as the Florida Keys, where homes have been destroyed and people are left without power and water. In Miami, roads have been turned into rivers, even though the eye of the storm missed the City. And we still don’t know the final death toll. Associated Press reports that 41 people have been killed since Irma first struck the Caribbean. And finally, European stock markets have closed in a flurry of green electronic ink, as today’s relief rally runs its course. Every major indices has risen today, thanks to two factors; the absence of fresh missile tests from North Korea, and signs that Hurricane Irma’s total damage will come in below forecasts. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 0.5% higher at 7413, a one-week high, up 35 points. In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 233 points, or just over 1%, at 22,033. That means world markets, as measured by MSCI, are at all time highs as London’s financial sector winds down for the day. Insurance companies continued to recover today - with Lancashire Holdings jumping by 10% in the City, and larger firms also recovering. David Madden of CMC Markets credits the latest news from Florida: The timing of Hurricane Irma wasn’t great seeing as it quickly followed the tropical storm Harvey. Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm, and even though it has caused a considerable amount of destruction, it hasn’t been as bad the markets were expecting. This also added to the bullish sentiment today, since the cost of the clean-up will be less than expected. Insurers like Aviva, Prudential and Legal &amp; General are all higher today as the payouts relating to Irma are likely to be below initial estimates. The situation in Florida remains very serious, of course, with some officials warning of a potential “humanitarian crisis” following the massive hurricane. But in the financial markets, orange juice and cotton future prices are recovering on hopes that the economic damage will be containable.. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says there was a “buying frenzy” - although London’s rally was held back because the pound has rallied 0.5% agains the euro. Beauchamp adds: Today’s price action marks a step change from a week ago, when fears of conflict on the Korean peninsula drove equities lower. Now normal service has apparently resumed, with triple digit gains on the Dow and the Dax. The FTSE is making heavy going of it, however, as sterling continues to gain ground versus the US dollar. The pound shows little nervousness so far ahead of a big week for UK data, and even the prospect of voting on the government’s EU withdrawal bill has not deterred the buyers. The debate around that bill is raging now: So that’s a good moment to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The rally on the US stock market has legs; every sector on the S&amp;P 500 index is now up on the day, with insurance firms leading the charge. Orange juice futures contracts are dropping, as traders respond to signs that Irma’s won’t cause as much damage to Florida’s citrus industry as feared. OJ futures are down 3% today, but that still means they are 9% more expensive than a week ago. Florida is the world’s second-largest orange producer, so the hurricane damage to crops will have a knock-on impact on prices. Wall Street’s rally is pushing world stock levels to fresh record highs. MSCI’s All Country World Index is now up 0.75% today at 483.12 points, a fresh record level. The All Country World Index tracks around 2,400 stocks traded in 47 countries, so is a good gauge of equity levels around the world. After a minute’s silence to mark 9/11, trading is underway on Wall Street. And shares are rallying, matching today’s gains in Europe and Asia. The Dow Jones index has gained 163 points, or 0.75%, with nearly every share rising. Travel firms such as Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival are among the top risers, reflecting hopes that Hurricane Irma will not be quite as severe as feared. Financial stocks and tech companies are also leading the way higher. The US dollar is also in favour, gaining almost 0.5% against other currencies today. Newsflash: Google has launched an appeal against the €2.4bn fine imposed by the European Union in June for abusing its dominant position in the search engine market. More here. The uncertainty over Britain’s exit form the EU hasn’t shaken London’s status as a financial powerhouse, according to a new report: The British pound is creeping higher this morning, as traders prepare for an influx of data later this week - and an interest rate decision. Sterling has nudged $1.321 against the US dollar, close to a five-week high. Tomorrow, the UK inflation rate is expected to rise to 2.8%, from 2.6% in July. That might refocus minds at the Bank of England about the possibility of raising borrowing costs from their current record low. The BoE meets on Thursday; the City doesn’t expect a hike, but policymakers could hint that rates will rise faster than economists expect. Shares are expected to rally in New York, when trading begins in 90 minutes time. Rising share prices seems like an odd reaction to the devastation caused by Irma in the Caribbean and in Florida. But Wall Street had been bracing for even more damage. Our Hurricane Irma liveblog explains that Florida dodged a bullet: Florida can thank Cuba, where it did hit as a Category 5 storm, said Maue and Jeff Masters, meteorology director for Weather Underground. Irma would probably have hit Florida as a Category 5 hurricane if it had missed Cuba, Masters said. The storm briefly trekked over Cuba’s low populated coast Friday evening through Saturday afternoon. That weakened Irma enough that when upper level winds from the west eroded some of the storm’s top and also blew in dry air, it had the combined of effect of making Irma more ragged, Masters said. It was at that point, he said, that Irma’s southwest eyewall sort of came apart, no longer a perfect circle on satellite imagery. Slightly weakened from Cuba, the storm got caught up in competing weather systems a little longer, delaying its northward right turn into Florida. And that delay pushed the track further west, making it more of a threat to Florida’s west coast than its east. Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate, BGC Partners, are holding their annual Charity Day, raising money for a wide range of good causes. The Charity Day was set up to remember the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald workers, and 61 employees of Eurobrokers employees, who died in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 16 years ago today. Cantor’s New York headquarters was based in the North tower of the World Trade Centre. Cantor and BGC distribute 100% of their global revenues on Charity Day to the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and dozens of charities around the world. Over in Canary Wharf, a steady stream of celebrities - and the Mayor of London - have been raising money by trying their hand at trading.... The latest word from Florida is that 5.78 million homes are currently without power, or almost 60% of the state. But despite this disruption, there is relief that Irma has weakened since making landfall, and may not wreck as much havoc as some experts estimated. Daiwa Capital Markets strategist Chris Scicluna said (via Reuters): “The good news was that the eye of Hurricane Irma took a path west of Miami and has since weakened to a Category 1 storm so that damage in Florida – whilst still severe... appears not to be quite as catastrophic as had been feared last week. And thankfully there was no bad weekend news out of North Korea either.” Here’s the latest: North Korea’s president can take the credit for today’s market rally, says Joshua Mahony of City firm IG: On a day that is largely devoid of any major economic releases of note, it is Kim Jong-Un who provides the unlikely source of bullish sentiment evident throughout global markets this morning. With North Korea celebrating the anniversary of the nation’s formation over the weekend, it has come as a surprise that we did not see a third consecutive weekend test from Kim Jong-Un. But this morning’s optimism could be tempered by a meeting of the United Nations later today, when the UN will vote on whether to impose new sanctions on North Korea. Mahony explains: Given that North Korea has provided one of the main drivers of volatility in recent weeks, today’s UN meeting over the potential implementation of further sanctions on the country will be crucial in gauging how likely we are to see further tests in the near future. With the US pushing for an oil embargo on North Korea, the Chinese and Russian decisions will be key, where their cooperation would be a kick in the teeth for Pyongyang leadership, sparking a likely military response. Newsflash: World stock markets have just hit a record high. Shares are continuing to climb in Asia and Europe, on relief that North Korea didn’t conduct another missile test last weekend. Hopes that Hurricane Irma will be less devastating than feared are also pushing equities higher, with insurance companies among the top risers today (as mentioned earlier). Munich Re, one of the world’s biggest reinsurance firms, are up over 4% this morning. The All Country World Share Index calculated by data firm MSCI has gained 0.35% to 481.25 points, helped by today’s gains in Asia and Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 is now up 53 points at 7431, a one-week high. Rebecca O’Keeffe, Head of Investment at Interactive Investor, says the City is less worried about North Korea as economists try to assess the full impact of the hurricane season. ”Equity markets are staging a relief rally after a less painful weekend than feared. Despite the fact that North Korea is now warning of ‘pain and suffering’ if the UN council votes for new sanctions today, investors have largely decided that the risks are more rhetoric than reality. Although Irma is still causing some problems, the impact is far less than the worst-case scenario predictions, with insurance companies topping the performance tables today as the direct financial cost of Irma is likely to be far less than feared. “Nevertheless, the insurance costs of this year’s hurricane season are just one small part of the overall impact of Harvey and Irma, with investors and analysts now trying to work out who could be the big winners and losers from this year’s savage weather. Rebuilding and reconstruction are likely to be a central theme over coming weeks with the DIY and construction industries likely to be beneficiaries. Demand for new automobiles could be affected substantially by their growing susceptibility to damage from floodwater. Oil and oil product markets remain volatile as the knock-on effects of both Harvey and Irma may affect demand and supply for some time to come. Florida is also a key supplier of agricultural produce to the US and wider market, not least orange-juice. “It is likely that the overall impact of the hurricane season will negatively affect US Q3 GDP, but boost Q4 and Q1 as the rebuilding effort gets into full swing. On the flip side, near-term inflation is likely to rise, not least as a result of higher gasoline prices. The combination of these two contrasting impacts leaves the Federal Reserve with an interesting dilemma over the remaining months of the year.” Over in Greece technical teams of auditors representing the debt-stricken country’s creditors are flying in to prepare the ground for what officials are hoping will be a last and problem-free bailout review. Helena Smith reports from Athens What amounts to the beginning of a third bailout review begins on a very different note. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras wants the compliance audit to be wrapped up imminently, telling delegates attending the international Thessaloniki trade fair this weekend that his leftist-led administration wants it completed “with great speed.” In his annual speech outlining the economic policies his government will adopt, Tsipras emphasised what he had repeatedly said during the French president Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Athens last week: that “Greece is turning a page” with growth and development after seven years of recession. Tsipras insisted that “Grexit” - ejection from the eurozone - had been replaced by “Grinvest”, as investor interest, the key to combatting unemployment, had surged. It is a far cry from the days when the young leftist firebrand vowed to stop the sell-off of Greece. China was the guest of honour at this year’s Thessaloniki fair, with more than 160 Chinese firms represented. Tsipras opened his speech saying Chinese investors were “welcome” in Greece. Foreign investment, he said, was vital to tackling joblessness, with youth unemployment still running at 40% in Greece. It could also help ameliorate the brain drain that had seen the best minds leave since the country’s great economic crisis began. The government hopes that the latest review will be concluded by December so that Athens can successfully exit its current bailout program on time next August. In private, however, officials are voicing fears that creditor demands may get in the way. Troubled construction company Carillion has suffered fresh upheaval; Zafar Khan, its group finance director, has left the Company with immediate effect. Shares in Carillion are down almost 5%. Khan’s departure comes two months after Carillion shocked the City with a big profits warning, partly due to problems with three public-private partnerships. Gold has lost its appeal this morning, as traders pile into riskier assets. Bullion has dropped by around 1%, or $20 per ounce, to $1,335. This morning’s risk-on mood is also giving the US dollar a lift. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group writes: The US dollar rebounded at the open. The greenback gained against all of its G10 counterparts, except the Canadian dollar, as Hurricane Irma weakened after hitting Florida over the weekend. Greenpeace says today’s offshore wind auction is a historic moment for green energy Emma Pinchbeck of Renewable UK, a trade body, has also hailed the low price of Britain’s offshore wind farms: It’s early, but the renewable energy industry may be tempted to crack open the champagne. A new UK government auction has just shown that the price of producing offshore wind power has dropped dramatically, bolstering the case for investing in green energy rather than nuclear. Wind developers bid aggressively for the latest government subsidies in the auction, with the winning bidders committing to building new windfarms for as low as £57.50 per MWh. In comparison, Britain’s new nuclear power station at Hinkley point will cost £92.50 per MWh, and take two years longer to build. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: As well as a major boost for renewables in the UK, which have suffered from government subsidy cuts in recent years, today’s auction will fuel a debate over whether ministers should rethink their commitment to new nuclear power to meet the country’s carbon targets. The Green party said the results should sound the death knell for Hinkley Point C,which is currently being built by EDF in Somerset. Here’s the full story: Europe’s equity markets are all comfortably higher this morning, as geopolitical worries ease. City investors are hoping that Hurricane Irma may not cause quite as much economic destruction as feared. Insurance company shares are rising in early trading. Bermuda-based Lancashire Holdings has jumped by 6.7%, while Beazley (which runs several syndicates at Lloyds of London) are up 5.7%. Before the storm hit Florida, insurance companies were bracing for bills of up to £150bn. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: Investors are feeling somewhat relieved today after the most dire predictions in terms of a disaster caused by Hurricane Irma have evaporated. The damage caused by Hurricane Irma is still colossal as streets have been changed into rivers and nearly 3 million people are without any power. However, thankfully, the overall impact of Irma is falling short of prediction. It is important to keep in mind that the full damage picture will still be colossal. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are rising this morning, on relief that last weekend passed without another provocation from North Korea. Britain’s FTSE 100 has popped back over the 7,400 mark for the first time in a week, up 35 points in early trading. Other European equity indices are rising too, following a solid session of gains in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei jumped by almost 1.5%, with Hong Kong and South Korea close behind: Fears that North Korea would mark its 69th anniversary with another nuclear test proved unfounded ; instead Pyongyang restricted itself to more traditional celebrations. Associated Press explains: North Koreans observed the country’s 69th founding anniversary with celebrations that included laying flowers and bowing at statues and portraits of past leaders. But Pyongyang did not carry out another test of its developmental intercontinental ballistic missile, as South Korea’s government had warned it might do. Attention now moves to the United Nations, where the United States has called for a vote later Monday on new sanctions. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says investors have regained their risk appetite. There is a positive start to the new trading week after North Korea avoided further provocation during its Founding Day celebrations (despite US calls for a ban on selling it oil/gas, a clear attempt to get China to help more).... Also coming up today Insurance companies will be starting to count the cost of Hurricane Irma, as the mega storm continues to blast its way through Florida. Irma is currently heading for Tampa Bay, leaving more than three million US homes without power behind it. Experts fear that a storm surge at high tide could bring even more damage. And we’ll be watching disgraced PR firm Bell Pottinger, which could drop into administration this week following the scandal of its “economic apartheid” campaign in South Africa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2016/mar/26/trencherman-eben-venter-review-novel-south-africa-apocalypse","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-26T07:30:21Z","webTitle":"Trencherman by Eben Venter review – South Africa after nuclear meltdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/26/trencherman-eben-venter-review-novel-south-africa-apocalypse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/mar/26/trencherman-eben-venter-review-novel-south-africa-apocalypse","fields":{"headline":"Trencherman by Eben Venter review – South Africa after nuclear meltdown","bodyText":"Trencherman, first published a decade ago in Afrikaans and now available for the first time in Britain, imagines a post-apocalyptic South Africa plunged into crisis by the explosion of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station and the almost total emigration of the country’s white population. Overtly writing back to Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Eben Venter depicts the once hopeful Rainbow Nation transformed into a feudal society run by criminal syndicates and blighted by child trafficking. Police are corrupt and central government has all but vanished. The novel’s narrator, Martin Jasper Louw, known as Marlouw, is – like Venter – an Afrikaner expat in Australia. His sister, Heleen, pleads with him to return to the family’s former Eastern Cape farm, Ouplaas (Old Farm), where her adult son, Koert, now lives. After their parents’ death, Marlouw had convinced Heleen that she should sign the farm over to the families who worked the land as compensation for generations of inequality. On his return to South Africa, Marlouw is warned that Koert, like Conrad’s Kurtz, has become a strongman, the distributor not of ivory but of dwindling supplies of mutton raised on the failing farm. Marlouw finds Ouplaas denuded of trees – fuel is a constant worry in the absence of electricity – and the house divided into sections allocated to the worker families, while Koert and his Aids-ravaged girlfriend, Esmie Phumzile, remain sequestered in their own private area. It is the mystery of Koert’s power over these people that drives Venter’s story. Although valued by the farm’s new owners, who rely on him as enforcer and patron, Koert is also a parasite, destroying the lives of everyone around him. Initially prevented by Esmie and the others from seeing his nephew, Marlouw is distressed to find that old ways of relating quickly resurface: “My presence has opened up the past. I represent the bad old days … the oubaas strides across the werf with his kierie and hat. He thinks to himself: a boer doesn’t work with his hands.” When Koert finally appears, late in the novel, it is impossible not to see the spectre of Marlon Brando’s Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, particularly in Marlouw’s shock at Koert’s physical transformation, the “beautiful” whiteness of his rower’s biceps lost to a hideous cascade of larval fat. Koert’s Afrikaans is as despoiled as his beauty: in place of the taal, or language, celebrated by apartheid-era Afrikanerdom, Koert speaks a melange of German, Dutch, archaic English, Afrikaans, isiXhosa and township slang in Luke Stubbs’s translation. A mad oracle foretelling the end of his people on the land, he warns Marlouw: “Your lot’s language that you shaped … and propped up so. What for? For nothing. Snot brudder of mine, let Koert truth-say for you: I am he, I am the taal, the volk, I am your destiny, your fear, das Ende des Lebens … the very heart of darkness who has remained.” In Marlouw’s humbling dependence on a community of black South Africans, we might hear an echo of Maureen Smales’s experience in Nadine Gordimer’s July’s People, also a speculative fiction about a future South Africa thrown into civil war. And there is also something of JM Coetzee’s Cape dystopia, Life &amp; Times of Michael K. Marlouw, like K, tries to find meaning amid the chaos by planting pumpkin seeds in earth that promises little generative hope. Futurity is among the novel’s primary concerns. Marlouw and Koert, both childless, become horribly distorted mirrors of each other; where Marlouw has a club foot, Koert has a gangrenous one. In a bravura speech of megalomaniac delusion, Koert notes that the women of South Africa are worst affected by Aids and wonders what it will mean if no one is left to bear children. Now, 10 years after its first publication, Trencherman can be read as one of the foundational texts of post-1994 South African speculative fiction, alongside Lauren Beukes’s Moxyland and Zoo City, and Henrietta Rose-Innes’s Nineveh and Green Lion. Venter’s novel, however, is working in a palpably different tradition, one in which those speculative energies are not global or even continental, but specific to South Africa, the dystopian nightmare framed as an effect of that country’s historical traumas and the real shortcomings of its democratic present. If there is light in Marlouw’s journey into darkness, it is perhaps in his refusal to presume he could ever right all that has gone wrong. Venter resists easy answers, convinced, it seems, of the intractable complexities of South African society now, and the difficulty of overcoming the horrors of its past. • Patrick Flanery’s I Am No One is published by Atlantic.

A project becomes so expensive and difficult during the planning stage that the sensible course would be to abandon it altogether. Yet the backers plough on regardless because they have invested so much time, money and energy. As financial assumptions are undermined, and delays occur, new reasons to proceed are invented. In this way, the project acquires a life of its own. Completion, at almost any cost, becomes the priority. Hinkley Point C, the government’s hoped-for £24.5bn nuclear power station in Somerset, is a classic of this genre. Once upon a time, it was possible to believe that a new nuclear fleet in the UK could provide reliable, low-carbon energy at a reasonable price to consumers. Yet two of those goals – reliability and cheap generation – simply aren’t going to be delivered by Hinkley Point, and it’s about time the government admitted as much. On the reliability front, Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors are struggling to open for business elsewhere on the continent. EDF’s plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule. “Our view is that EPR’s future is bleak: too big, too costly, and still unproven,” said HSBC’s analysts last month. In terms of costs to consumers, the agreed price is horrendous. Hinkley’s output will be guaranteed at £92.50 per megawatt hour, rising with the rate of inflation every year for 35 years. That rate is more than twice the current wholesale price. Even onshore wind is cheaper; by 2023, Hinkley’s latest estimated opening date, offshore wind may be too. Yet still the farce continues. In Monday’s episode, the chancellor, George Osborne, tried to do EDF’s job by encouraging wavering Chinese investors to commit their slug of the financing for Hinkley. He announced a £2bn loan guarantee (the first of a potential £16bn) and half-promised something far more interesting to his hosts – the chance to construct their own nuclear reactor, build to a different design, in Essex. This is undignified stuff for a UK chancellor. If the Chinese don’t want to fund Hinkley despite all the subsidies and guarantees thrown at the project, too bad. The Treasury could fund the thing itself, if it really wanted to, without making semi-promises to Chinese nuclear constructors. Osborne, instead of travelling to Beijing to plead for cash, would have done better to stay at home and order an independent review of Hinkley’s economics. He might find, as HSBC did, that there is “little logic for the UK government committing to the existing EPR model”. Unfortunately, there is now little chance of that happening – Hinkley must proceed because the government has decided that a U-turn would be too embarrassing. RSA jilted with no suitors Stephen Hester and RSA refrained from calling Zurich Insurance a bunch of timewasters but it would have been a reasonable insult to throw. After two months of negotiations, and with an agreed price of 550p a share on the table, the Swiss retired meekly on Monday, pleading the need to get their own house in order before attempting a £5.6bn takeover. This is limp stuff from Zurich. Insurers exist to handle losses and cannot be surprised when a big claim arrives. In this case, the supposed deal-breaker was a $275m whack from the port of Tianjin explosion in China. In reality, if such a sum could undermine a run at RSA, the bid approach was probably wrong-headed in the first place. Martin Senn, Zurich boss, has some explaining to do to his shareholders. As for Hester, he is now obliged to go back to plan A, which means completing the disposal programme (the operation in the Middle East is the last remaining big one) and cutting costs in the UK, Scandinavia and Canada. The strategy makes sense since RSA, in terms of efficiency and underwriting, is off the pace set by traditional rival Aviva. Yet, in the current low-interest rate climate, where investment income generates next to nothing, the prospect is one of hard graft. Consolidation is still the likely long-term trend for this industry so, one of these years, RSA may reappear in the takeover window. But, for now, RSA shareholders are obliged to confront one uncomfortable lesson from this episode: despite all the chat about rival bidders when Zurich announced its approach in July, nobody turned up. In the circumstances, you can understand why RSA’s share price settled almost 10% below the pre-approach level. CMA delay They are busy folk at the Competition and Markets Authority, where they are investigating the state of play in two big politically sensitive markets – banking and energy. No surprise, then, that timetables are slipping. Provisional findings on retail and small-business banking are due next month, having originally been planned for this month. On energy, full findings have been pushed out to next June, instead of this Christmas. A lot of people have a lot of opinions, it seems, and “the inquiry group also wants to ensure it has sufficient time to conclude the further evidence-gathering and analysis required for the final report”. Fair enough – and it’s best to ensure the analyses and remedies are robust. But the CMA could do itself a favour by not wasting time on silly inquiries like the study of Poundland’s acquisition of 99p Stores. It took two attempts to arrive at the correct (and obvious) answer that competition would not be harmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-16T14:29:40Z","webTitle":"Nuclear deals with China could endanger UK national security, says Labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/16/nuclear-deals-with-china-could-endanger-uk-national-security-says-labour","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear deals with China could endanger UK national security, says Labour","bodyText":"David Cameron has serious questions to answer about whether Chinese investment in nuclear power would endanger national security, Labour’s shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy has said. Nandy called on the government to reassure the public after reports that the intelligence agencies have concerns that possible Chinese investments in Hinkley Point and Sizewell could pose a threat to the UK. There are said to be particular worries that a Chinese state-owned company could insert backdoor traps into the technology, enabling it to shut down the station in the event of a diplomatic row. The concerns have emerged on the eve of a state visit to the UK by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during which George Osborne, the chancellor, hopes a nuclear deal will be finalised. He has already offered £2bn in guarantees to incentivise French state company EDF and Chinese state-owned companies to start work on Hinkley Point in Somerset, the first new plant in a generation, and it is possible the Chinese company could then seek to build its own reactor at Bradwell in Essex. Ahead of the official visit next week, the Times has reported an anonymous security source as saying: “There is a big division between the money men and the security side … The Treasury is in the lead and it isn’t listening to anyone – they see China as an opportunity, but we see the threat.” Nandy said Labour and the public were worried about the new nuclear deals not just on the grounds of cost but also security. “What these revelations have done is to underscore why people are so concerned not just about putting our energy security but actually putting our national security potentially at risk as well,” she said. “The government should be able to answer those questions before the Chinese visit early next week when they are hoping to firm up the deal. “The public are entitled to some reassurance about that. The trouble is that what’s ending up happening is they have unravelled plan A (by cutting renewable subsidies) without having any plan B and we are backing ourselves into a corner with real implications not just for households but the nation as a whole. That is why it is so serious.” Following the report, a Downing Street spokesman said the government would keep security under review at all times but it would not be encouraging China to fund UK nuclear plants if it felt there was any danger. “As we’ve set out, and as the chancellor has been saying recently, we are in a new era of engagement with China … We are continuing to work with the Chinese in this area but we take security in this area extremely seriously and we will continue to keep it under review at all times,” he said. The spokesman said the independent nuclear regulator had done all the due diligence and was “content with things as they stand”. “We will obviously continue to ensure that all security and other regulations are followed at all times,” he said, adding: “We wouldn’t be pursuing this course of action if we felt there was a threat to national security.” Osborne has held up the prospect of a new golden relationship with China ahead of Xi’s visit and was praised by Chinese state-owned media last month for not pushing the issue of human rights. In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is hoping to use the official state banquet at Buckingham Palace to raise China’s human rights record, after reports that more than 100 lawyers, journalists and other government critics were detained in a crackdown in early July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/20/north-korea-nuclear-missile-could-it-hit-california-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-20T10:00:24Z","webTitle":"North Korea nuclear threat: should California start panicking?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/north-korea-nuclear-missile-could-it-hit-california-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/20/north-korea-nuclear-missile-could-it-hit-california-trump","fields":{"headline":"North Korea nuclear threat: should California start panicking?","bodyText":"In test blasts, military parades and propaganda videos that show San Francisco and Washington DC in ruins, North Korea has broadcast its intention to be a world nuclear power. Less clear, experts say, is how close the secretive nation is to realizing its ambitions to threaten the mainland of the United States. As rhetoric between the two nations has ratcheted up in recent weeks, residents of major west coast cities such as San Francisco, Portland and Seattle have begun to ask out loud: should they be worried? After five nuclear tests in a decade, North Korea has already shown that it poses a nuclear threat to South Korea and Japan, roughly 80,000 American soldiers stationed in those countries, and to China, its nominal ally. But although Kim Jong-un has dramatically increased missile testing since he took power in 2011, North Korea has yet to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could cross nearly 5,500 miles of the Pacific. North Korea would need to overcome two feats of engineering to threaten the American mainland: a working ICBM system and a warhead for one of those missiles. Unlike shorter-range missiles, long-range missiles have multiple engines and flight stages, meaning North Korean engineers have to make rockets – and bombs – that can survive the violent vibrations of launch, the wrenching g-forces of flight, and the temperature changes of takeoff and re-entry from space. “Producing a warhead that can handle all that is a challenge,” said Joseph Bermudez, an analyst for 38 North, a thinktank affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Kim has said he wants to test an ICBM later this year, Bermudez doubted the test would be a success. In February, North Korea fired a medium-range missileinto the Sea of Japan, travelling about 300 miles. North Korea has also developed a missile with an estimated range of 2,200 miles, almost halfway to Hawaii, but so far struggled to launch it. Until North Korea begins ICBM tests, it will be difficult to gauge the country’s capabilities, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. “If they do get to the point where they decide to start a campaign of ICBM flight testing, that will allow them to work through the usual technical difficulties,” he said, noting that they had an “impressive” record of solving problems. “It will allow them in time, I’m confident, to create a reliable weapon.” But Pollack was wary about any timeline. “They could flight test an ICBM today and it could work or it could take them a year or two,” he said. “I really hesitate to say anything about it.” Other experts have offered cautious estimates, based on the rate of testing in the last six years. “If everything proceeds as is, it’s likely by 2020 that they could have a system reaching the United States,” Bermudez said. “It should be viewed as an emerging threat.” After the fifth test last fall, Siegfried Hecker, the former director of Los Alamos National Lab, the cradle of the first atomic bomb, gave a similar assessment. “Left unchecked, Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or so,” he wrote in a post for 38 North. While North Korea cannot hide its missile tests – even short-range tests are usually visible to satellites – it has performed nuclear tests in a tunnel system beneath a mile-high mountain. The secrecy means experts know relatively little about how small or sophisticated North Korea’s bombs are, or how many exist. Experts agreed, however, that North Korea probably has the means to fit a warhead to an ICBM. “It’s within the range of their technical capabilities and competence,” Bermudez said. “That doesn’t mean they could easily or successfully do it.” The US has reportedly made it more difficult for North Korea to get missiles off the ground, with a series of cyber-attacks begun by Barack Obama. But government hackers alone probably cannot stop North Korea’s ambitions, Bermudez said. “It’s likely that any cyberwarfare campaign would not be able to stop either the nuclear program or the ballistic program, only delay it.” Donald Trump vowed on Twitter earlier this year that Kim would not test an ICBM, and his advisers have not ruled out pre-emptive military action. Last weekend’s parade, the experts said, showed a natural arc in North Korea’s progress: a mix of propaganda, aspirations and actual progress, to take with a grain of salt. In the parade North Korea showcased two apparently new ICBMs, larger even than existing models already designed to reach the east coast of the US. “That does not mean it’s ready, that also does not mean it’s fake,” Pollack said. “You see a mix of old and new, some things not quite ready for primetime, others tried and true.” Hecker and Pollack have urged diplomacy to stall North Korea’s program, saying that Obama’s non-negotiating policy of “strategic patience” gave Kim time to develop ICBMs as leverage. “The good news, if you’re worried, is first of all the North Koreans are not suicidal, they’re not going to just start a war,” Pollack said, noting that the US had coexisted for decades with other nuclear rivals, Russia and China. “So this is a familiar condition for us and I don’t think we need to get too worked up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/02/a-punchy-climate-book-from-a-citizen-scientist","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-02T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"A punchy climate book from a citizen scientist | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/02/a-punchy-climate-book-from-a-citizen-scientist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/02/a-punchy-climate-book-from-a-citizen-scientist","fields":{"headline":"A punchy climate book from a citizen scientist","bodyText":"We know the climate is changing, the Earth is warming, and humans are the cause. As a scientist who studies this daily, I know the evidence is compelling and mutually reinforcing. In fact, the evidence is so compelling that it’s almost impossible to find scientists who disagree. We also know that it’s possible to solve this problem using today’s technology. We don’t need to wait for fairy dust or cold fusion. Using energy more wisely, increasing renewable energy, modernizing nuclear power, and other actions are all things we can do right now to make the future better. But we also know that there are many groups and companies that are trying to stop meaningful action on climate change. Sure, many are fossil fuel companies that want to continue to sell their product. Others are ideological groups and people that for various reasons reject the compelling science. They cannot bring themselves to understand the facts because it conflicts with their belief system. These groups and people spread misinformation and purposely try to muddy the waters by creating a “fake news” environment of sorts. For the rest of us who are interested in making this world better but not experts on climate change, it’s a real challenge to separate the science from the baloney. Not only do you have to know the science, but you may have to communicate it in a very concise situation. We scientists are trained to bloviate, not to persuade. Fortunately, there is help. For anyone who wants easy to access, short elevator-speech responses to the most common questions and myths about climate change, a new resource is available. Interestingly, it was authored not by a climate scientist but by a citizen scientist. I’ve read the text and can vouch for its scientific accuracy. The book is entitled Twenty-eight Climate Change Elevator Pitches written by Rob Honeycutt - a contributor to Skeptical Science. This book covers topics typically in 2-3 pages. Really short, really concise, always on point. Rob uses analogies to help describe climate science in ways that the rest of us can relate. He includes both basic science chapters as well as myth debunking. For instance, he relates geological climate change to a boxing match The basic science topics he covers include titles such as “Ancient Sunlight”, “Radiative Gases”, and “The Climate System”. He also includes 2-3 page discussions on temperature measurements, ocean warming and sea level rise, acidification, ice, past climate change, tipping points, and more. Included with each chapter are rich and engaging graphics. Why do I like this book so much? Well, part of it is that the discussions are short and punchy. They really are elevator speeches. They don’t get bogged down in too much detail. Crucially, his science is correct. Rob finds a way to identify what are the essential things people need to know and focuses on those items. I also like that this book is simultaneously a warning but also optimistic. He is correct that climate change is a serious problem that we need to face. But, he is also right on in recognizing that there are solutions to this problem that can be implemented immediately. Furthermore, as Rob writes, ignoring the problem will be more injurious than facing it head on. I asked Rob why he decided to write this book and he responded: After finding and taking an online climate change quiz, I noted that the average score for those taking the quiz was only 54%. People who were self-selecting to take the quiz – people who were interested in the topic – were missing basic climate information. I figured what was needed was a way to access basic, accurate climate information in a more time-efficient manner. The book is available on the iBooks store and through Blurb."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jul/13/thursday-briefing-putin-wanted-clinton-to-win-says-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T05:04:18Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Putin wanted Clinton to win, says Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/thursday-briefing-putin-wanted-clinton-to-win-says-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jul/13/thursday-briefing-putin-wanted-clinton-to-win-says-trump","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Putin wanted Clinton to win, says Trump","bodyText":"Top story: Trump hits back in Russia row Good morning. I’m Martin Farrer and here is your morning roundup of the best news and features from the Guardian. Donald Trump has claimed that Vladimir Putin wanted Hillary Clinton to win the US election as he sought yet again to quell the storm over his campaign links to Russia that threatens to engulf his presidency. In an interview with veteran Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, Trump defended his embattled son over allegations of improper election campaign dealings, dismissing it as a “witch-hunt”. And claiming that although he got on “very, very well” with Putin, Trump said the Russian president wanted Clinton to win because she would not have “made the US military stronger” or “opened up” the world energy market with more coal production and fracking. “There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he (Putin) would want,” said Trump, who flew to Paris overnight for a state visit and meeting with French president Emmanuel Macron. The handshake should be fun. Trump might be glad for a little respite from the storm back home where Democrats are calling for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to be stripped of his security clearance after it emerged that he failed to disclose his attendance at the now-notorious meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya. * * * Labour puts PM ‘on notice’ – Theresa May faces a humiliating parliamentary Brexit defeat over the “great repeal bill” after Labour said it would vote against the legislation without significant concessions. As MPs prepare for the publication of the bill today, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said he was putting the prime minister “on notice” and demanded changes on matters from parliamentary scrutiny to workers’ rights. A withdrawal of Labour support for the bill would leave the government vulnerable to defeat if backbench Tory MPs were to rebel and vote against it. May’s woes continued to pile up as the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier issued a warning to the UK that “the clock is ticking” on the two-year negotiation process and the head of the government’s public spending watchdog, Amyas Morse, suggested that the government’s approach to Brexit could fall apart “like a chocolate orange”. * * * Great spot – Nasa has released stunning images of Jupiter’s great red spot, the huge storm that has been raging on the planet for hundreds of years. The Juno probe passed as close as 3,500km above the planet to photograph its famous feature and beam back raw data that Nasa has shared with scientists and the public. It is hoped that the mission can discover more about the the makeup of the planet, from its magnetic field to its radiation environment, and what fuels the red spot. * * * Power surge – The expected sharp growth in electric vehicles on our roads could cause a demand for electricity to jump by 8GW by 2030, according to National Grid.

Kelly was named chairman of the environment and energy committee at the party room meeting on Monday, making him responsible for coordinating backbench feedback to the government on climate and energy policy. He said he was proud to be a climate sceptic rather than “wallow in groupthink, to be a sheep, or a lemming”. Kelly described himself as in the “Bjorn Lomborg” camp, suggesting wind and solar funding should be channelled into “further research” because those current renewables like wind and solar power had “diminishing returns”. Kelly said such changing the funding directions could create less emissions reductions in the short term but would have greater gains in the longer term. “I’m in Bjorn Lomborg camp, you have to put resources into a technological breakthroughs because [wind and solar] is on periphery and having so little effect,” Kelly said. His comments came on the day the governor general outlined the Turnbull government’s three-year strategy when opening the parliament. In the speech written by the prime minister’s office, Cosgrove lauded the Solar Communities program, which provides funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Kelly took to his Facebook page to quote Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, saying “the interest of [subsidy receivers] is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public”. “I want to keep the debate going to see what is the best policy and what the costs are,” he told Guardian Australia. “There should be a cost-benefit analysis on these policies because one thing that greatly concerns me is the amount of people having their electricity cut off, because they can’t afford the bills.” Kelly said while he accepted that there had been temperature changes that had occurred since the mid 1700s and 1800s, there was no consensus around its causes. “The question is how much is CO2 induced and how much is natural?” Kelly said. “There is no consensus on that science, that warming is 100% result of CO2 but I accept part of it is CO2 induced.” Kelly said on energy policy it was important for people to accept the importance of low-cost energy – given the more people had to spend on electricity, the less they had to spend on the economy. “If we let prices creep up, we are going price ourselves out of the market,” he said. “By subsidising the cost of solar, that puts upward pressure on electricity prices and by setting targets for certain emissions, that puts upward pressure on prices.” Kelly said in considering the price of power, the option of nuclear power should be considered, though “the case has not been made out for nuclear power in Australia and I doubt that it actually will”. Kelly has previously argued the British officer Watkin Tench’s statements about Sydney summers in 1790-91 showed heat was extreme hundreds of years ago. But on Tuesday he said his article was a bit “tongue in cheek” to show up people who suggest one hot day was proof of global warming. “Read the history, read how careful these guys were with measurements and how things were happening, there is anecdotal evidence of mass deaths of bats and birds,” Kelly said. He said while the rate of warming in the past 20 years had not been in line with predictions by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change predictions, he did not think the planet was cooling – in the past 150 years. “No I don’t accept the argument that the planet is cooling, it has been warming for 150 years but it depends on how far you go back in time,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/feb/22/humbled-unilever-show-shareholders-values-loyalty","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-22T19:36:53Z","webTitle":"Humbled Unilever aims to show shareholders it values their loyalty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/feb/22/humbled-unilever-show-shareholders-values-loyalty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/feb/22/humbled-unilever-show-shareholders-values-loyalty","fields":{"headline":"Humbled Unilever aims to show shareholders it values their loyalty","bodyText":"There’s nothing like a bid – or, in Unilever’s case, a non-bid that goes away within 48 hours – to shatter a mood of comfortable complacency in a boardroom. The chief executive, Paul Polman, after his unpleasant encounter with Kraft Heinz, appears to have drawn two correct conclusions. First, it was embarrassing that a company of Unilever’s size and standing could even be viewed as prey by Kraft’s cast of job-slashing billionaires. Second, the best way to improve matters is for Unilever to get its share price higher. Wednesday’s statement – “The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever” – was woolly but significant. Unilever is conceding, in effect, that it cannot take its shareholders’ loyalty for granted. Polman was probably told as much by a few powerful fund managers who do not share his love of long-term perspectives. But what does “accelerating delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders” mean? In Kraft Heinz’s mouth, translation would be easier. It could imply thousands of job losses, cuts in investment and less time spent fretting about sustainable models of capitalism. Polman, one suspects, will do none of those things. He could hardly do so with credibility given his many admirable statements about reducing Unilever’s environmental footprint and being a force for social good. But there are actions Unilever could take without trampling on its heritage. Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood set out five this week: sell the perennially underperforming Flora spreads business; demand higher profit margins; be tighter on capital expenditure; use the strong balance sheet to buy more small businesses or to return cash to shareholders; communicate with investors better. None of those sound too painful. The last merely exhorts Polman to stop the pretence that he does not give guidance when he does, just in unnecessarily vague terms. Indeed, the company has already discovered that its profit margins in 2017 will be at the top end of the intended range when the lower end was expected only a month ago. A proper long-range target for margins – 18.5% by 2020, suggests Wood, versus 15.3% last year – could be a useful discipline. Such a self-help plan sounds more credible than wacky notions like bidding for Colgate or splitting Unilever into two pieces, food and personal care. On day one, the fightback went well and the share price rose 6%. Jolly good. Now let’s see the Kraft shock translate into action. Long-term horizons are terrific – but, if you’re a public company, you have to be able to protect your independence. Lloyds shrugs off Brexit vote In the days after the UK voted to leave the EU, Lloyds Banking Group’s shares fell from 70p to 48p. The theory was simple: Lloyds, as the UK’s biggest lender, is a proxy for the state of the UK economy, and the outlook was about to turn bleak. Now the shares, up 4% on Wednesday, have regained all the ground lost. It is too soon to sound the all-clear, of course, and the Lloyds chief executive, António Horta-Osório, in his overview of 2016, felt obliged to include the standard warnings about the “unclear” nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU and the “uncertain” economic outlook. All the same, it is hard to discern any impact on Lloyds’ business from the Brexit vote. There are few signs of strain on the default front. Impaired loans have not soared, as the City feared, and are only 1.8% of the book, versus 2.1% at the end of 2015. Nor did Lloyds feel a need to alter well-signalled plans to pay bigger dividends. Not every lender will look so solid and, yes, the dial can turn again when the moment of Brexit approaches. But, in retrospect, the panic over banks was wildly overdone. Takeover rules will need critical definition In encouraging news, Greg Clark, the business secretary, says he will set out proposals on the government’s stance towards foreign takeovers of British firms, or at least as it will apply to “critical infrastructure”. Task one: define what you mean by critical. Nuclear power and car manufacturers will clearly be inside the tent. But where do you stand on pharmaceutical firms, or even Unilever? Spell it out, and then describe how intervention will be enforced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/23/bill-shorten-to-accuse-coalition-of-vandalism-over-pragmatism-on-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-22T19:11:09Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten to accuse Coalition of 'vandalism over pragmatism' on energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/23/bill-shorten-to-accuse-coalition-of-vandalism-over-pragmatism-on-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/23/bill-shorten-to-accuse-coalition-of-vandalism-over-pragmatism-on-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten to accuse Coalition of 'vandalism over pragmatism' on energy policy","bodyText":"The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, will dig in behind his party’s goal of sourcing 50% of Australia’s electricity from renewables by 2030 and the party’s proposed emissions trading scheme, arguing they are vehicles to drive new investment in clean energy. Shorten will use a speech at Bloomberg in Sydney on Thursday to hit back against the prime minister’s recent intensification of the energy debate, declaring Malcolm Turnbull, through his partisan attacks, is generating renewed investment uncertainty in the electricity sector and, as a consequence, undermining jobs. The Labor leader’s intervention comes as a new report from the Climate Council to be released on Thursday finds solar power is now more affordable than new fossil fuel and nuclear power, with costs diving over the last five years. The new report says solar costs have dropped 58% in five years and are expected to continue to fall by a further 40-70% by 2040. A Climate Council member and former president of BP Australasia, Greg Bourne, says Australia is currently undergoing a surge in solar, with more than 20 industrial-scale installations going ahead in Australia during 2017 and another 3,700 megawatts in the pipeline. Shorten will meanwhile use the speech at Bloomberg to try and hit back after weeks of government bombardment about Labor’s energy and climate policies. His intervention follows the publication of this week’s Guardian Essential poll, which found that 65% of voters supported Labor’s 50% renewable energy goal. The new survey underscored broad-based community support in Australia for renewables. It also showed that most people believe recent power blackouts in South Australia are not attributable specifically to a comparatively high share of renewable energy in the state but to failures of the energy market in responding to extreme weather events. Turnbull has repeatedly branded Labor’s 50% renewable energy goal as reckless and ideological but the policy won strong majority approval from both Labor and Green voters in the latest Essential survey. Coalition voters were also more likely to approve of the policy than disapprove. The poll suggests the Coalition’s political campaign against Labor’s renewable energy schemes, which has been underway since South Australia was plunged into a statewide blackout last year, hasn’t moved the dial in any significant way. The Essential data suggests attitudes to Labor’s 50% by 2030 policy have changed little since it was unveiled by Shorten in 2015. Shorten will say on Thursday when it comes to capitalising on jobs in the renewables sector: “Australia has got a dream barrier draw. “We are the world’s sunniest continent, one of the windiest places on earth and our universities, research centres and firms keep producing leaders in the field. “But, despite the prize on offer, despite all our natural advantages – we’re not just stuck in the gates, we are going backwards. “When the Coalition came to office and declared war on the RET scheme, investment in large-scale renewables fell by 88% in one year. After being rated one of the four most attractive destinations in the world for renewable energy investment in 2013, we now don’t even crack the top 10. “In the last three years, the world has added nearly 3m jobs in renewable energy and Australia has lost 3,000. If the Liberals had just stuck to the old conservative nostrum of first, do no harm, if they’d done nothing but keep pace with the global trend, we would have added 7600 jobs. “Instead, at every turn, they have chosen vandalism over pragmatism.” Shorten will describe the 50% policy – which he struggled to answer questions about last week – as “Labor’s target, our goal, our objective and our aspiration”. He will argue meeting that target will require more than the existing legislated federal RET scheme – it will require an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector to drive private investment in renewable generation and technology; support for research and investments in renewable energy technology; and a plan to modernise the national electricity market by making sure market rules reflect the imperative to reduce pollution. Shorten will say that approach will deliver cheaper, cleaner and more reliable power. He will argue a trading scheme for the electricity sector will drive investment not only in renewables but in gas. “Because gas produces roughly half the pollution generated by burning coal – an EIS will inevitably make gas a more attractive investment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/24/trump-accuses-china-of-being-grand-champions-of-currency-manipulation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T10:03:53Z","webTitle":"China hits back at Donald Trump's 'champion of currency manipulation' jibe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/trump-accuses-china-of-being-grand-champions-of-currency-manipulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/trump-accuses-china-of-being-grand-champions-of-currency-manipulation","fields":{"headline":"China hits back at Donald Trump's 'champion of currency manipulation' jibe","bodyText":"Beijing has hit back at Donald Trump after the US president risked reigniting a simmering feud with China by accusing it of being the “grand champion” of currency manipulation. After months of turbulence and uncertainty between the world’s two biggest economies, relations appeared to settle two weeks ago after the US president and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held their first phone conversation since the billionaire’s inauguration. However, in an interview with Reuters on Thursday that also saw Trump reiterate his desire for American nuclear supremacy, the US president, who has attacked China over trade, Taiwan, North Korea and the South China Sea, threatened to undermine the tentative rapprochement with a fresh verbal assault. “I think they’re grand champions at manipulation of currency. So I haven’t held back. We’ll see what happens,” Trump said. The president’s comments were reported just hours after the incoming treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, made apparently contradictory remarks signalling that the White House had no immediate plans to label China a currency manipulator – something Trump had pledged to do on his first day in office. Beijing rejected Trump’s claims on Friday, with a foreign ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang, claiming his country had “no intention of deliberately devaluing its currency to gain a trade advantage”. Asked by the Guardian about Trump’s claims of currency manipulation, Geng said: “If you must pin the label of ‘grand champion’ … on China, then we are a grand champion of economic development. We’ve made great achievements since the start of economic reform and opening-up, making us the undisputed grand champion.” Chinese scholars expressed frustration at the president’s allegation. “He has such a big mouth. What can we do about it? Let him talk,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University. Economists in and outside China reject Trump’s claim – repeatedly aired during his campaign – that China is guilty of purposefully forcing down the value of its currency, the yuan, in order to boost its own exporters and hamstring US manufacturers. “The logic of Trump’s claim is that he believes other countries keep their currencies artificially cheap to increase their exports to the US. [But] as a matter of fact, the Chinese yuan has seen a 13% devaluation since last year,” Zhu said, pointing out that Trump had previously also accused South Korea and Japan of manipulating their currencies. Christopher Balding, a Peking University finance professor, said: “China is clearly manipulating its currency, there’s no two ways about it. But at this point they are essentially propping up the value of their currency rather than manipulating it lower to gain an unfair trade advantage. “To some degree Trump is correct, that of any major economy they probably are the grand champions of currency manipulation,” he added. “But we need to very clearly distinguish between manipulating a currency to gain an unfair trade advantage – which they were pretty clearly doing maybe a decade to five years ago but they are clearly not doing that these days – and propping up the currency.” Over the past year, China’s central bank has spent billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves shoring up the yuan to counter capital outflows, Reuters reported. Trump told Reuters that he wants the US to expand its nuclear arsenal, in his first comments on the issue since taking office. He said: “We’re never going to fall behind any country even if it’s a friendly country. We’re never going to fall behind on nuclear power. It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we’re going to be at the top of the pack.” In statement, the Arms Control Association said Trump’s position was misguided: “Mr Trump’s comments suggest, once again, that he is ill-informed about nuclear weapons and has a poor understanding of the unique dangers of nuclear weapons. “The history of the cold war shows us that no one comes out on ‘top of the pack’ of an arms race and nuclear brinksmanship.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2017/may/18/burning-man-plane-art-boeing-747-ken-feldman","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-18T10:00:23Z","webTitle":"Burning Man's plane art: mile-high ambition or corporate takeoff?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/may/18/burning-man-plane-art-boeing-747-ken-feldman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2017/may/18/burning-man-plane-art-boeing-747-ken-feldman","fields":{"headline":"Burning Man's plane art: mile-high ambition or corporate takeoff?","bodyText":"In 2015, a group of artists and engineers worked together to transform a Boeing 747 airplane into an interactive art project. Salvaging parts from an aircraft boneyard, they re-imagined the fuselage as a fur-lined, LED-lit lounge and transported it to Nevada’s Black Rock Desert for the Burning Man festival. This August, the plane returns in its entirety with a full set of wheels, both wings, and a second-floor DJ booth. The project co-founder, Ken Feldman, first attended Burning Man in 2008 and caught what he calls the “the art car bug”. “Mutant vehicles”, or art cars, form an unconventional transit system that carries people across the desert. When Feldman brought a flame-spitting, purple unicorn inspired by the popular YouTube video Charlie the Unicorn to the festival in 2011, he gathered a small following. The next year, he saw a bicycle comprised of airplane parts and “something just clicked”, he explains, and he thought “why don’t we build an art car out of an airplane?” Feldman identifies as a “serial entrepreneur” and before working on the 747 project full-time founded several cloud storage companies. At the Mojave desert build site, he works alongside a retired nuclear power plant technician and high-ranking engineers from Nasa’s jet propulsion lab. Stationed at an aerospace test center where rocket motors are frequently tested and wind turbines dot the hills, volunteers weld together aluminum plates and brainstorm elaborate wing-reattachment plans. Supported by a fundraising campaign that raised nearly $90,000 – Feldman established the nonprofit organization Big Imagination to fund the 747 project. Crowdsourced funds, however, account for less than a quarter of their overall budget. The project is buoyed by deep-pocketed investors such as venture capitalist Jonathan Teo, a former manager at Google and early investor in Snapchat. So far, the 747 project is the sole recipient of funds. “To a lot of veteran burners, the 747 project is a symbol for the commodification of playa art,” explains Ben Ross, a film-maker and festival attendee. It’s the largest art car to enter Burning Man, and in years past, required a dedicated highway escort system to make the 900-kilometer trek from the Mojave. Despite what some in the community might say, Feldman sees the 747 project as separate from the surging influx of investor-class money. “People think that this is just some rich person’s project, and yes, our budget is big, but we are not the most expensive project,” he explains. “We have one or two people who happen to be in venture capital but with VCs, all their money is wrapped up. They’re not, like, rolling in cash.” Inside the fuselage, haphazard ladders lead to partially finished projects and windows are boarded up to keep out desert winds. There are ice coolers stocked with beers and whiteboards covered with illegible calculations. Repurposed jumpsuits, assorted drill bits, out-of-use electrical sockets, and industrial masks abound. “Working on the plane is about working spatially,” explains Kelly Vicars, a volunteer logistics coordinator. “If you need a tool, you walk across the plane to get it.” Vicars has been going to Burning Man for the past four years, but this is the first time she has worked on an art car. The volunteers stay in a nondescript, four-bedroom house with a view of the highway. Conversation topics range from the merits of microdosing to the ergonomics of Indian office furniture and the wild success of the television show Top Gear. Save for two rows of recycled airplane seats and some air mattresses, the house is unfurnished. On a poster board taped to one wall, alternative names for the FAA – the Federal Aviation Administration – are workshopped (example: Fucking Anarchy Association). The group functions like a “pirate anarchy collective”, as August West, a volunteer, says, “where people that live in their own spheres of freedom come together because they want to.” This freewheeling spirit resonates with the libertine culture of the festival – where money is banned and a gift economy is upheld in its place. The volunteer crew on the 747 project tend to look past the project’s six-figure budget and see its value in purely emotive terms. To enter the plane itself, participants pass through an “insecurity checkpoint” and check their so-called “emotional baggage” before going through TSA – which stands for either Total Self Acceptance or Touching Sensitive Areas. Words such as transformative and inspiring are frequently used to explain the perceived value of the project. “There are other ways to do this project that would’ve been easier and cost less, but they wouldn’t have had the same dramatic impact,” Feldman explains. Considering San Francisco’s ongoing homelessness crisis and the urgent need for reader-supported journalism (eg Mother Jones is raising $500,000 to investigate the Trump-Russia connection) there are no shortage of causes where a six-figure donation could make a real impact. The egalitarian spirit of the festival is somewhat aspirational, as it is undermined by the barrier of entry: steep ticket prices (which cost between $400 and $1,200), job security that allows participants to take off nine or more vacation days, and the resources necessary to build an art car. For those that make it to the festival, “there’s no velvet rope, and you don’t need a wristband” to get on to the plane, Feldman says. “Everybody can come on board.” As a riff on radical inclusivity – one of the core values of the burner community – the 747 project espouses what they call “radically inclusive exclusivity”. Just as libertarians perceive the world as devoid of power inequities, burners often envision the playa as an otherworldly place where class divisions do not apply. While Burning Man is grounded in communal values, concentration of tech wealth determines, which projects are built and an ethos of fierce individualism has gathered steam. “There are ways in which people use money to get to Burning Man by finagling a ticket that flies in the face of radical self-reliance,” Vicars says. “I hope that the 10 principles that Burning Man was founded on keep wealth disparities from really changing the event.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/18/labour-sure-it-can-see-off-ukip-in-stoke-central","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-18T20:29:11Z","webTitle":"Labour sure it can see off Ukip in Stoke byelection despite voter apathy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/18/labour-sure-it-can-see-off-ukip-in-stoke-central","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/18/labour-sure-it-can-see-off-ukip-in-stoke-central","fields":{"headline":"Labour sure it can see off Ukip in Stoke byelection despite voter apathy","bodyText":"Labour MPs are increasingly optimistic that the party will hang on to its seats in two crucial byelections on Thursday, as it prepares for a race to the wire with Ukip in Stoke-on-Trent Central and the Conservatives in Copeland. Despite poor national polling for both Labour and Jeremy Corbyn, party campaigners in the West Midlands and Cumbrian constituencies believe incumbency and local issues including the NHS are likely to lead to victory. In Stoke, Labour activists have taken heart from the troubled campaign of Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, who faced questions over his residency in the constituency, failed to name one of the six pottery towns in the seat and admitted he had not lost close personal friends at Hillsborough despite claims on his website. Vernon Coaker, the Labour MP for Gedling, who canvassed there last week, said: “We are positive. It’s been a tough fight with Ukip but Paul Nuttall’s claims have come up on the doorstep. All of those things about Hillsborough and his home address have been raised. We have taken the battle and the fight to Ukip, we haven’t just stood back and let them say things. We are also highlighting the impact of a Tory government on Stoke.” The seat is especially unpredictable because of the expected very low turnout but two Labour MPs said they believed they would hold on to Stoke even though there was “no wild enthusiasm for Labour” and a fair degree of hostility towards Corbyn. Toby Perkins, Labour MP for Chesterfield, said: “The sense that Paul Nuttall has damaged his own campaign is a very real one and a sense of ‘is it a protest worth risking?’ That has sharpened over the last couple of days.” Labour HQ sources were also optimistic about holding Copeland after the prime minister went to the seat last week without offering any guarantees about the future of maternity care or nuclear power – two dominant issues in the Cumbria constituency. Another Labour MP who has just returned from Copeland said: “If we win, we will have ground out a victory in those two seats because of the hard work of activists on the ground despite the leadership. I hope Jeremy and his supporters will be gracious enough to recognise that. What we have is a ground game.” Speaking at the Labour local government conference in Warwick on Saturday, Corbyn said the byelections were a chance to “send a message to a Conservative government that puts the rich first but neglects the sick, the elderly, and those with disabilities”. Commenting on Tony Blair’s call for a cross-party movement to halt Brexit, Corbyn said the speech had been “unhelpful”. He added: “The referendum gave a result, gave a very clear decision on this, and we have to respect that decision, that’s why we didn’t block article 50. But we are going to be part of all this campaigning, all these negotiations about the kind of relationship we have in Europe in the future.” He added: “The referendum happened, let’s respect the result. Democracy happened, respect the result.” The national picture for Labour is still difficult. According to the latest Opinium/Observer polling of 2,000 voters last week, support for Labour dropped by three percentage points to 27%, while backing for the Conservatives rose three points to 40% in the month in which Theresa May’s Brexit bill has passed through the Commons with the help of the Labour frontbench. The Lib Dems were unchanged on 8% and Ukip also remained on 14%.

The Scunthorpe company, one of the two remaining steelworks in the UK, was sold to investment group Greybull Capital by Tata Steel last June, as the Indian-owned company shrunk its British operations in the face of heavy losses. But British Steel said the plant had returned to profit in the first nine months of its financial year, in an update that will raise hope that new life can be breathed into steelmaking in the UK. British Steel put the improvement down to cost cuts and “significant” contracts, including a £2m agreement to supply the steel for the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. The Scunthorpe plant is believed to have lost £80m in the final year of Tata’s ownership, but is on course to make enough to cover £39m of investment and turn a profit. Greybull is understood to believe it can reach an underlying profit of more than £100m by its third year of ownership. British Steel’s revived fortunes have resulted in it pledging to reverse a 3% salary cut agreed with 4,400 employees to help save the steelworks. Restoring workers’ salaries will cost the company about £9m and is due to take effect in June. Paul McBean, the British Steel multi-union chairman, said: “We’ve shown we’re fighters, we’ve shown we’re survivors and now we’ve got to show that we can become industry and national champions.” British Steel’s executive chairman, Roland Junck, said: “I’m pleased to report that after our first seven months of trading, we are building on our promising start to life as British Steel.” Junck previously said the business became profitable again 100 days after Greybull bought Tata’s long products division for £1 and revived the dormant British Steel brand, vowing to invest £400m. In an update on Wednesday, he said the business was trading in the black and could grow thanks to the Hinkley supply deal and contracts to make rails for the Algerian and Italian train networks. “Having implemented the first stage of our turnaround plan, returning the business to profit and putting it on a sustainable footing, we are now well positioned to implement the next stage of the plan,” he said. “We’re already making good progress with significant contract awards from both new and existing customers.” Greybull bought the company after the UK steel industry had been under pressure for several years due to factors including a flood of cheap Chinese products on to the market, which sent prices tumbling. The crisis threatened the future of several major steelworks, including Tata-owned Port Talbot, whose staff are shortly due to vote on a cost-cutting plan that would see their final salary pension scheme closed. But Junck said British Steel could still carve out a bright future, despite continuing pressure on the industry. “Domestically we are in a unique position to provide large quantities of steel for developments through the UK, whether that be major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Heathrow [expansion], or smaller projects such as the building of new schools or hospitals,” he said. He said the company was enjoying support from the governments of the UK and France, where it also has a comparatively small business. Junck previously claimed that Tata Steel had “lost interest” in the Scunthorpe steelworks before it was sold to Greybull. The investment group celebrated the takeover by restoring the name British Steel, which disappeared in 1999 when its predecessor merged with a Dutch rival to become Corus. Corus was later bought by Tata Steel before the company, part of Indian conglomerate Tata, began looking for a way out of the UK steel industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2016/aug/06/the-big-issue-nuclear-power-tidal-power-hinkley","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-06T23:03:19Z","webTitle":"Look to the sea to provide the energy the country needs| the big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/06/the-big-issue-nuclear-power-tidal-power-hinkley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2016/aug/06/the-big-issue-nuclear-power-tidal-power-hinkley","fields":{"headline":"Look to the sea to provide the energy the country needs","bodyText":"Fusion or fission, nuclear power is not the only reliable alternative to fossil fuel (“Britain’s energy dilemma: if not nuclear power, then what?” News). Sunshine, wind and waves vary with the weather, but tides still rise and fall and the flow can be safely harnessed in and out. With nuclear fission not yet in sight, this simpler seapower could be a better bet than a rejigged evolutionary power reactor at Hinkley Point C. In his autumn statement last year, George Osborne flagged up the prospect of a tidal lagoon power project in Swansea Bay, only to put it out for review when the price of oil and gas came down. The start-up cost for Swansea Bay stands at £1.3bn as against £18bn for Hinkley Point. The planned productive life of a lagoon is more than 100 years compared with 60 years for Hinkley Point C. Over the years, with rising output from larger lagoons around the coast, tidal input to the national grid could match Hinkley nuclear in cost and quantity. The modest Swansea Bay venture is set to pilot a fleet of bigger enclosures with two-way turbine arrays to harness an exceptional tidal range, extending from Welsh and British coasts across the Channel to France. The technology of lagoon-wall dykes and low-speed turbines is relatively simple. Lagoons carry no heavy overhang of radioactive waste and decommissioning. They are most unlikely to blow up and in case of major breakdown the damage would not be insupportable. A government decision on funding for Swansea Bay now awaits the outcome of an independent review later this year. With luck and common sense, this could be ready in time for Philip Hammond to give the go-ahead for this first tidal lagoon in his first autumn statement, opening the way to a wider list of private investment and jobs along a supply chain in waiting.

He was involved in the building of two of Britain’s first nuclear power stations – and went on to work on projects at the National Gallery and Glyndebourne. Eric was born in a two-up, two-down in Prosperity Street in Leeds; his father, Louis, was a tailor and his mother, Fanny, a housewife. He attended Cockburn high school in Leeds and graduated from Leeds University in 1947 with a BSc in mechanical engineering, and went on to do his national service with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. After a period in which he oversaw the building of conventional power stations, in 1957 Eric became chief commissioning engineer for the Nuclear Power Group (TNPG) during the construction of the Berkeley and Dungeness power stations. After leaving TNPG he became cost and planning manager for the global engineering company Foster Wheeler, and during this period was president of the International Project Management Association, between 1982 and 1986. In 1987, at an age when many would have been looking forward to retirement, Eric was appointed client project manager for the construction of the Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery. After completing this contract successfully, he worked in the same capacity for the rebuilding of the opera house at Glyndebourne. His many awards included the Freedom of the City of London and fellowship of the Royal Society of Arts.

That’s the good news. But it makes meeting the UK’s carbon emissions targets harder and will cost energy bill payers more. This is the result of the many contradictions it contains. Energy bills must be “as low as possible”, Rudd says, but the government is turning its back on the cheapest clean options: energy efficiency, onshore wind and solar power. Coal must be phased out but only to be replaced by gas, another fossil fuel which itself must be largely phased out within 15 years. All energy technologies must compete in a market - unless it is nuclear power. No one could say energy policy was easy and it’s a relief to have a plan at all. Uncertainty is kryptonite to investors, and without new power plants, a dark future awaits. Since May, the UK’s energy policy has consisted solely of a concerted attack on renewable energy and green measures and huge subsidies for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. The headline today is that the UK plans to close all coal power stations by 2025. The UK is the first major economy to set such a deadline and should be applauded. Politically, it is well timed to bolster the UK’s position at the crunch UN climate change talks in Paris in December, which was being undermined by moves against renewables. But while coal provides 25% of the UK’s electricity today, it was already set to fall to almost nothing by 2025. Rudd’s announcement also contained a worrying caveat: “Let me be clear, we’ll only proceed if we’re confident that the shift to new gas can be achieved.” The new dash for gas reprises the push from chancellor George Osborne in 2012, which the industry almost completely ignored. Just one gas plant is being built, at Carrington (no relation). A subsidy called the capacity mechanism - payment for guaranteeing supply - was meant to entice gas plants. Instead, dirty coal and diesel generators cashed in. So, despite Rudd’s repeated insistence that competition is vital, she is set to rig future capacity auctions for gas: “After this year’s auction we will take stock and ensure it delivers the gas we need.” Gas is half as polluting as coal and some call it a “bridge fuel” to the zero emissions world which is needed to halt climate change. But Rudd’s policy is a bridge with no exit in sight. What is to stop gas plants operating for years after 2030, when UK electricity must be virtually carbon-free to meet climate targets? Not carbon capture and storage, if the single fleeting mention of CCS in Rudd’s speed is any guide. The billions of pounds in subsidies for the North Sea - the UK is the only G7 nation increasing fossil fuel subsidies - and strong backing for fracking suggests the dash for gas could become a marathon. The UK is not on track for its EU targets of 15% of renewable energy by 2020 and 50% carbon cuts by 2025, but Rudd insists the government is committed to meeting them. “Paris must deliver a clear signal that the future is low carbon,” she said. US president Barack Obama, also speaking on Wednesday, agreed but talked of going “all-in on renewable energy technologies”. For renewables, Rudd said, competition is key: “We need to work towards a market where success is driven by your ability to compete in a market, not by your ability to lobby government.” I asked her if the same applied to nuclear power? “We must be frank that nuclear provides the essential baseload that allows us to back renewables. At the moment renewables can’t be relied on, they are intermittent, and we need to have an absolutely secure supply of electricity for homes and businesses.” That is, in my view, a long way of saying no. Rudd said energy security “has to be the number one priority” and, despite nuclear power’s faultless track record of rising costs and long delays, she is convinced it is both vital and viable: “We don’t just want one nuclear power station, we want more and would expect those costs to come down.” Rudd also said: “Our intervention has to be limited to where we can really make a difference – where the technology has the potential to scale up and to compete in a global market without subsidy.” But again this doesn’t apply to nuclear power, which has never been built without subsidy despite half a century of trying, but to offshore wind power. Here, there was good news. Offshore wind is currently expensive but its cost has fallen by 20% in two years. By 2020, there will be 10GW of wind farms around the UK coast, providing about 10% of all electricity. Rudd said the government would support a further 10GW to be built if costs comes down further, to equal that given to new nuclear (£92.50/MWh). Renewables have to compete with nuclear, if not vice versa. There were also positive moves on making a smart grid a reality, including changing regulations that restrict people from being offered cheaper power at off-peak times, which cuts overall demand. But perhaps the most worrying aspect of the new energy policy is its apparent abandonment of the cheapest energy measure of all - efficiency. From 2010 to 2015, 4.5m homes benefited from government-backed energy efficiency measures and therefore lower bills. Rudd’s commitment for 2015-20 is 1.2m, almost 80% lower. Worse, unlike low-carbon heating, there was no promise of future announcements. There is another way, a system dominated by renewables and efficiency, and Rudd herself set it out: “Some argue we should adapt our traditional model dominated by large power stations and go for a new, decentralised, flexible approach. Locally-generated energy supported by storage, interconnection and demand response, offers the possibility of a radically different model.” Then she said: “It is not necessarily the job of government to choose one of these models.” But by backing nuclear at any price and a dash for gas, she has already chosen. Just days before the Paris climate summit aims to accelerate towards the clean energy system of the next century, the UK is harking back to the energy system of the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2017/mar/25/museum-rescues-sculptor-camille-claudel-from-decades-of-obscurity","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-25T00:03:08Z","webTitle":"Museum rescues sculptor Camille Claudel from decades of obscurity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/25/museum-rescues-sculptor-camille-claudel-from-decades-of-obscurity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/25/museum-rescues-sculptor-camille-claudel-from-decades-of-obscurity","fields":{"headline":"Museum rescues sculptor Camille Claudel from decades of obscurity","bodyText":"Two elderly ladies sit side by side, one English, one French, one smartly dressed, one wearing clothes that were already very old fashioned by the late 1920s when the photograph was taken. One, her hand reassuringly on the other, looks slightly towards the camera: the other is wrapped in her own thoughts, not reacting to the camera, her companion or the world. The photograph is the last known image of the sculptor Camille Claudel, once a renowned artist, a dazzling beauty, and lover of the most famous sculptor of the day, Auguste Rodin. Her career is celebrated in a new museum opening on Sunday in the small French town of Nogent-sur-Seine, which holds the largest collection of her work in the world. By the time the photograph was taken in 1929, Claudel had already spent years in a French mental hospital. She died there in 1943, and was buried in a common grave. Her companion was the English artist Jessie Lipscomb, who had shared a studio in Paris and lodged with Claudel’s mother when they were young women in the 1880s, together carving out daringly independent careers as artists. Claudel stayed with Lipscomb’s family in Peterborough and they holidayed on the Isle of Wight but they eventually fell out, as Claudel did with almost everyone close to her. Lipscomb, and her husband William Elborne who took the photographs, were among a handful of visitors to Claudel in the decades she vanished from the world. Claudel’s brother Paul, who became a poet and diplomat and was once her beloved companion and the subject of several loving portraits on display in the museum, is believed to have visited 12 times in 30 years. Her mother, who had committed her to the asylum in 1911 within months of the death of Claudel’s stern but affectionate father, never came. Claudel and her family lived for just four years in Nogent-sur-Seine, a small French town south-east of Paris, but crucially it was where, as a 12-year-old, she first began sculpting in the local clay. Apart from the good clay, the small hardworking town with its large mills on the river – and now a nuclear power station, clearly visible from the top floor of the museum – has no obvious attractions for an artist, although Gustave Flaubert loved it and set his novel A Sentimental Education there. However, in the 19th century, it became home to several famous sculptors. Claudel’s father sent her work to their artist neighbour, Alfred Boucher, to rule on whether his daughter had talent. Boucher was certain she had, and went on to support, encourage and teach her – and, crucially, introduce her to Rodin. Her relationship with Rodin soon developed into a full-blown affair, but she was also his studio assistant and an artist in her own right whose work he respected: the redeveloped Rodin museum in Paris includes a room of her work. When their relationship disintegrated because she was determined to be seen as more than just his protege, the effect on her was calamitous. By 1911, Claudel was living as a recluse in a studio in Paris, systematically destroying much of her work, convinced that what she termed “Rodin’s gang” would break in and steal her ideas. Her mother had her committed to an asylum at Val-de-Marne. She and the other patients were moved for safety to another asylum in the first world war, and there she died in 1943. “It is a tragic story, but it is hard for us to judge now,” curator Cécile Bertran said. “Modern experts have looked at her records and she really was very ill.” Bertran said Claudel was offered art materials in the asylum, but refused, still convinced that Rodin might somehow get at them. The town has paid for the museum, an elegantly plain building designed by Adelfo Scaranello architects wrapped around the shell of the old Claudel home. Project architect Martin Quelen said there was no question of restoring the interiors of Claudel’s day, which had been rebuilt many times, leaving no evidence of their use. Instead a series of handsome plain daylit galleries have large windows, giving views into the streets she knew. The museum also hold towering works by Boucher, who left his collection to the town, and works by the artist friends he encouraged to do likewise. Claudel is now far more famous than any of them. The plan for a new museum arose out of an exhibition of her work in 2003, which in a town of 6,000 people attracted more than 40,000 visitors. The first object in the museum is a monumental bronze sculpture of a writhing couple, which to Bertran is a poignant symbol of Claudel’s life. It was first exhibited as a plaster model, but she never won the commission which would allow her to have it cast in bronze. Long after her death, when it was finally cast, the plaster had been badly damaged by its decades in storage, as lost to the world as the artist had been."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/21/uk-china-cybersecurity-pact-xi-jinping-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T16:13:23Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping state visit: UK and China sign cybersecurity pact","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/21/uk-china-cybersecurity-pact-xi-jinping-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/21/uk-china-cybersecurity-pact-xi-jinping-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping state visit: UK and China sign cybersecurity pact","bodyText":"China has agreed not to use cyber-espionage to steal commercial secrets from the UK and its president spoke positively about improving human rights, following talks with David Cameron on the second day of the state visit. Appearing side-by-side with Xi in Downing Street, the prime minister used a short press conference to brush aside concerns about working so closely with an undemocratic nation to announce unprecedented cooperation on sensitive issues of security. “I’m clear that the UK is China’s best partner in the west,” he said. Cameron said that the cyber agreement is a first step towards wider potential security cooperation between China and the UK, in which each country will agree not to condone or conduct spying on each other’s intellectual property and confidential corporate information. GCHQ has reported “disturbing” levels of cyber-attacks on British companies, which are thought mostly to originate in China and Russia. The deal also mirrors one agreed between China and the US last month, but which the American monitoring group CrowdStrike believes was violated almost immediately. As Cameron hailed a new relationship between the countries, Xi struck a conciliatory tone as he said his country is ready to increase cooperation over the difficult issue of human rights. “Coming to the human rights issue, China attaches create importance to human rights. We have found a path suited to China’s conditions,” he said. “There is always room for improvement in the world. China is ready to increase co-operation with UK and other countries over human rights.” Xi also mounted a defence of China’s steel strategy against accusations it is dumping cut-price product on the market, which UK steelmakers have blamed for forcing them to close and mothball plants. “I want to answer the steel question. The world is seeing an oversupply [of steel] following the financial crisis. China also has overcapacity,” he said. “We have taken a series of steps [to remedy this]. We have cut 700m tonnes of production capacity. You can imagine the task of finding jobs for those workers.” The president made the comments after UK journalists were allowed a single question to each leader, allowing the BBC to press him on why the British public should be pleased about such a high level of cooperation with a country that has a deeply troubling record on human rights. Cameron was also asked how a steelmaker who had lost their job might feel about the pomp and extravagance accorded to the Chinese president, when the country stands accused of helping fuel the crisis in the British steel industry. The prime minister responded with a forthright defence of the UK’s decision to push for closer ties with China. “I reject the [premise] that you either have a conversation on human rights and steel or you have a strong relationship. I want both,” he said. Downing Street confirmed Cameron raised the issue of human rights with China, which has been condemned internationally by campaign groups over the detention of hundreds of its critics earlier this year. However, Cameron’s official spokeswoman refused to say how he approached the subject, whether he raised the plight of any particular people, and even whether the discussions lasted for longer than a minute. Earlier, Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist who has in the past been detained by his government, suggested Cameron was being too accommodating on the issue of human rights. “I think the British prime minister has had a record on putting human rights aside which is very bad strategy and also is a very bad aesthetics, because this certainly doesn’t represent the British people,” he told Sky. Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International, said Xi’s comments about improving human rights were welcome but “a considerable understatement”. “With more executions taking place in China than the rest of the world put together, with lawyers and human rights activists being arrested and disappeared, and with even the most modest forms of dissent being severely punished, the Chinese president should be promising wholesale human rights reform,” she said. The talks focused on trade and foreign affairs, with the two countries discussing the potential for common ground on Syria in a conversation that is set to continue at Chequers on Thursday. The UK is thought to be seeking to persuade China not to vote in tandem with Russia at the UN as global leaders seek a resolution in the war-torn nation that does not involve Bashar Al-Assad. The flagship announcement is a £6bn investment by a Chinese state company in the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset, which is due to be built by around 2025. However, there were numerous other deals, including more than £12bn of oil and gas ventures. The biggest of these is a $10bn deal for Britain’s BP to supply China’s state owned power station, Huadian, with liquefied natural gas. Other announcements involve a branch of the Legoland amusement park opening in Shanghai, an investment in the Royal Albert Docks regeneration by Chinese developer Advanced Business Park, a £2.6bn deal for Carnival to make new cruise ships, a £1.4bn for Rolls-Royce to supply engines and £2bn of healthcare deals between Chinese and UK companies, universities and organisations. The Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point was questioned on national security grounds by Admiral Lord West – who served as a minister under Gordon Brown. “I do have very real concerns looking to the future in terms of security,” said West, a former head of the navy and a counter-terrorism minister. He told BBC’s Newsnight: “There are certain things that I think you need to control and you need to be sure that you can always deliver them to your people.” It also emerged that Sir Andrew Witty, the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, will join a board to promote British-Chinese trade – a year after the company was handed a a $500m fine for bribing Chinese doctors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/01/countryside-under-threat-ministers-infrastructure-britain-open-business","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-01T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"UK countryside at risk in rush to declare Britain ‘open for business’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/01/countryside-under-threat-ministers-infrastructure-britain-open-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/01/countryside-under-threat-ministers-infrastructure-britain-open-business","fields":{"headline":"UK countryside at risk in rush to declare Britain ‘open for business’","bodyText":"Some of Britain’s best-loved landscapes are being threatened by the government’s rush to declare the country “open for business”, warn rural campaigners. Large developments and infrastructure projects are planned in some of the UK’s most treasured tourist destinations, including the Lake District, the Cotswolds, and Sussex’s High Weald as well as on large swaths of green belt land. Britain’s open spaces are likely to come under further pressure in the next few years. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, pledged £23bn for the National Productivity Investment Fund in his autumn statement, with money earmarked in the next five years to create an Oxford to Cambridge expressway and new railway infrastructure in the Midlands. The government has also set a target of 200,000 new homes a year, and some expect that target to be increased in the housing white paper, due to be published this month. Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said there was “a real concern” about the way development is being prioritised. “Everybody recognises that we need to update infrastructure, and the CPRE’s traditional role since it was set up in 1926 has been to question whether or not it’s necessary and if there are alternatives to industrialising landscapes,” Spiers told the Observer. “There’s a terrible sense right now that ministers are just keen to say that Britain’s open for business at the expense of everything else. It’s all justified on narrow economic grounds, and I’m not sure anyone is standing back and saying ‘what are the alternatives?’” One major infrastructure development under consideration is the National Grid’s £2.8bn plan to connect the planned Moorside nuclear power station, Sellafield’s replacement, to the UK power network with a 102-mile long power line. The route goes through the Lake District national park, and while the National Grid plans to put 15 miles of cabling underground through the park, 90 pylons each 48m (160ft) tall, will be erected in a line just 10m from the park’s southern edge through the Duddon estuary. Campaigners from the group Power Without Pylons and the Friends of the Lake District will gather today for a protest walk through the area. “It would destroy some of the most spectacular landscapes of the national park,” said the organisation’s Elaine Essery. “We think there are better alternatives – and they would amount to tens of pence on people’s electricity bills.” The National Grid’s final consultation on the issue closes this Saturday. With the pylon scheme considered a “nationally significant infrastructure project”, the final decision on whether it will go ahead will be taken by the Secretary of State, currently Greg Clark, at the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Of 50 schemes that have been decided since NSIP rules were introduced in 2008, only one has so far been rejected, according to Power Without Pylons. To add to campaigners’ fears, planning laws and regulations on house-building have been significantly relaxed in recent years in an attempt to address the housing shortage in the south-east of England.

The charges, which will be passed on to nearly 30 million customers, are a result of ministers’ decision to guarantee the new Hinkley Point C operators £92.50 for every unit of electricity – more than double the current market price. It comes less than a week after the government admitted the £24bn plant in Somerset will be subsidised – something it denied throughout the last parliament. Details of the costs – an average of about £150 to £660 per customer over the 35 years of the deal – are exposed in a document quietly put before parliament last week and which has only just come to light. It also reveals that taxpayers would have to pay up to £22bn compensation to the owners, French energy giant EDF and the Chinese government, if the UK government or the European Union do something that forces the plant to close early. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, but the operators will now be penalised if it is later than that, and government can cancel the deal if it is not operating by 2033. Tom Burke, chairman of environmental thinktank E3G, also said the government estimate of the price guarantee – £4.4bn-£19.9bn in today’s prices – underplayed the sums involved. His organisation estimates that with annual inflation the actual sum handed over during 35 years will be £45bn. “I’m not surprised they want to hide what a bad deal it is and sneak it past parliament,” said Burke. MPs now have little more than a week to stop the agreement being signed off by the Treasury. The Green MP Caroline Lucas on Wednesday made a formal objection in Parliament. The document also reveals: Further guarantees for nuclear waste disposal and insurance under which the government will help pay costs if they rise above a certain level. Both sides can renegotiate the deal 15 years and 25 years after reactor 1 starts working – with no need for parliament to agree new terms. The plant’s owners can make a profit of more than 11% before they share the gains with customers – more than double the level for subsidised renewable operators. Some good news for consumers: if the cost of building the two reactors is below estimates, or if interest on the debt is reduced in future, at least half the saving must be returned to them. The Department for Energy and Climate Change defended the deal, arguing the minimum £4bn extra cost for billpayers was comparable with existing subsidy charges for renewable energy projects at a similar scale. A spokesperson said: “Hinkley will provide clean, affordable and secure energy. It will power 6m homes for nearly 60 years and consumers won’t pay a penny until it is up and running. This is a good deal for everyone and a major step forward for the UK economy – bringing billions of pounds of investment to the UK and creating more than 25,000 jobs.” The apparently high profit margins follow modelling for DECC that suggest the Hinkley project would be rated “at the top end of junk”, partly because of concerns over the untested EPR reactors being used, and loss of expertise in the UK industry. Last week, it was announced that the Chinese government will take a one-third share in Hinkley and work with EDF on two further nuclear plant proposals at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. The guaranteed market price will drop to £89.50 per megawatt hour if the plant at Sizewell goes ahead rapidly. EDF, backed by the French government, has already spent £2bn on the site and expects to ramp up building work in November. HSBC has urged George Osborne, the chancellor, to “delay or abandon” the scheme, and the world’s two biggest credit rating agencies – Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s – have warned they could downgrade EDF’s credit rating because of the “risky” project – making it more expensive for the company to borrow money."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/mar/04/uk-could-quit-eu-without-paying-a-penny-say-lords","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-04T11:53:57Z","webTitle":"Brexit: UK could quit EU without paying a penny, say Lords","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/04/uk-could-quit-eu-without-paying-a-penny-say-lords","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/mar/04/uk-could-quit-eu-without-paying-a-penny-say-lords","fields":{"headline":"Brexit: UK could quit EU without paying a penny, say Lords","bodyText":"The UK could walk away from the European Union in 2019 without paying a penny, the House of Lords has said, in a report bound to raise tensions with Brussels in the run-up to Brexit talks. The British government would have no legal obligation to either pay a €60bn (£52bn) Brexit bill mooted by the European commission or honour payments into the EU budget promised by the former prime minister David Cameron, according to analysis by the House of Lords EU financial affairs sub-committee. In a report published on Saturday, the committee argues that the British government would be on strong legal ground if it chose to leave the EU without paying anything, adding that Brussels would have no realistic chance of getting any money. The peers stress, however, that if the government wants goodwill from EU countries and a deal on access to European markets, agreement on the budget will be important. “The UK appears to have a strong legal position in respect of the EU budget post-Brexit and this provides important context to the article 50 negotiations,” said Lady Falkner of Margravine, the Liberal Democrat peer who chairs the sub-committee. “Even though we consider that the UK will not be legally obliged to pay into the EU budget after Brexit, the issue will be a prominent factor in withdrawal negotiations. The government will have to set the financial and political costs of making such payments against potential gains from other elements of the negotiations.” Ingeborg Grässle, a German centre-right MEP who chairs the European parliament’s budget control committee, said she was astonished at the “really disappointing” conclusions. “It is not about the money. It is about responsibilities. The question is, do you stick to your engagements?” she told the Guardian. Grässle, who gave evidence to the Lords committee, described their conclusion as “putting the knife on the table” and said, if taken, the approach would damage Britain’s Brexit negotiations. “Do you start with a view to let everything go straight to the wall or do you want a result?” she asked. She suggested the UK was not taking Brexit talks seriously. “The EU feels that we have to organise a real divorce and we have to sort out the money, the kids, who gets the dog and the cat … and for the British, it is as if they are leaving a golf club,” she said. The peers’ argument will be toxic to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, whose staff drew up the mooted bill ranging from €55bn-€60bn (£47bn-£52bn). This covers the UK’s share of EU civil staff pensions, unpaid bills and decommissioning nuclear power plants. Barnier is expecting the UK to pay into the EU budget in 2019 and 2020, putting the UK on the hook for payments worth £12.4bn, agreed by Cameron in 2013. The EU’s €1tn, seven-year budget was negotiated in late 2013 by EU leaders including the British prime minister. It is due to expire at the end of 2020, although bills may be trickling in until 2023. This reflects that payments for EU-funded infrastructure projects, such as roads or airports, are not settled until two to three years after being promised. A commission spokesperson said: “During the time of its membership, the UK has taken – and will take – financial commitments. They should be honoured in full. This will be an essential element of the negotiations on the orderly separation.” The report is likely to cause alarm among the 2,900 British nationals who work or are retired from the EU institutions and fear their futures, including pensions, will become a political football. Barnier is seeking to move the debate away from figures: early in the talks, he will seek to agree principles of liability with the British government, rather than presenting a bill – an approach backed by member states, who agree that the UK should pay its share. Brussels sources acknowledge that the Brexit bill varies depending on the assumptions, with estimates ranging from €20bn to more than €70bn. Grässle said the €60bn estimate looked reasonable when the UK’s share of EU liabilities, pensions and budget promises was taken into account. The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has hinted that Britain may pay into the EU budget to get single market access, but large payments would be a political problem for the Conservative government. Setting out her Brexit vision last month, Theresa May said: “The days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/15/business-nils-prately-on-finance-hinkley-point-c-deep-rethink-nuclear-power-uk-china-edf-cost-design","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T18:44:17Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: now for a deep rethink on the nuclear adventure?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/15/business-nils-prately-on-finance-hinkley-point-c-deep-rethink-nuclear-power-uk-china-edf-cost-design","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/sep/15/business-nils-prately-on-finance-hinkley-point-c-deep-rethink-nuclear-power-uk-china-edf-cost-design","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: now for a deep rethink on the nuclear adventure?","bodyText":"It’s astonishing. British governments have fiddled for a decade with the terms and structure of the Hinkley Point deal. The proposed agreement runs to thousands of pages, as you would expect with an £18bn contract to build the first new nuclear power station in the UK for a generation. Yet nobody seems to have considered what would happen if EDF, an over-indebted outfit over-reliant on the goodwill of current and future French politicians, ever wanted to sell Hinkley. Theresa May’s review is a let-down on the central question of whether the Hinkley Point C project should proceed; she should have binned the project because the technology was unproven and the financial terms a rip-off. But she has addressed the question of future ownership. The UK government will be able to block EDF from selling its stake before and after construction. Similar powers will be secured in future by the UK government taking a special share in infrastructure projects deemed critical to the nation’s security. This is welcome and overdue. Before the clause was inserted, it would have been possible, in theory, for EDF to sell its majority stake in Hinkley to its Chinese co-financiers, the state-backed CGN firm. Overnight, 7% of the UK’s energy supply could have been in the hands of a country with a long and dishonourable history of cyber espionage. David Cameron and George Osborne, as they conducted their love-in with Beijing in recent years, ignored the worry in their desperation to find a new partner for EDF after Centrica, the owner of British Gas, dropped out of the Hinkley consortium in 2013. The energy select committee, shamefully, also danced around the subject of national security. May deserves some credit for addressing it. The Brexit vote, incidentally, may have strengthened her hand. The EU tends to hate golden shares. Outside the club, it should be easier for the UK to adopt stronger protection over ownership of critical infrastructure. But the government is overstating matters when it says the UK’s policy will now fall into line with other big economies. The US imposes far stricter restrictions on foreign ownership of nuclear plants on its soil. That is why, one assumes, the Chinese appear happy to accept May’s “significant new safeguards”. For Beijing, the big prize has always been the chance to gain international recognition for Chinese technology by building a nuclear power station in Bradwell, Essex, to its own design. That prospect is still alive. But let’s hope May’s brief probe of Hinkley heralds a deeper rethink on the UK’s entire nuclear programme. On cost and design, the adventure has lost touch with common sense. First, cost. Hinkley, as everybody knows by now, is hideously expensive. If it were up and running today, EDF and CGN would be receiving annual revenues of £2.8bn, calculates Peter Atherton, of Cornwall Energy. But only £1.2bn would represent the market price of the electricity produced. The rest, £1.6bn, would be a top-up payment ultimately paid by the public. The figure is large but, if it were a one-off, perhaps tolerable. The UK’s 27m households use about 40% of the country’s energy. Crunch the numbers and a theoretical “Hinkley subsidy” works out to about £24 per household a year at current prices. The problem, of course, is that Hinkley in north Somerset is not a one-off. It will provide about 3,200MW of capacity. The government’s decarbonisation programme envisages up to 18,000MW of nuclear capacity by 2035. If Hinkley-style handouts are repeated, you’re talking serious money for consumers and a big hit to the competitiveness of UK industry. That risk is real because of the second issue: the madness of a nuclear new-build programme in which all are invited to pitch. It’s not just China that wants to bring its kit – Japanese, South Korean and US firms are also on the ticket for new plants. The UK could end up building four different reactor designs from five different manufacturers. That is inherently more expensive than picking the best design, replicating it and harvesting economies of scale. The UK’s approach, argues Atherton, is “the equivalent of having the four new Trident nuclear subs built in different shipyards to different designs”. It’s too late, it seems, to stop Hinkley. But May should order a rethink of the rest of the UK’s nuclear plan. It’s a badly designed mess that no other country would copy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-03T23:48:59Z","webTitle":"Can Europe’s new xenophobes reshape the continent?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/03/europe-xenophobes-continent-poland-hungary-austria-nationalism-migrants","fields":{"headline":"Can Europe’s new xenophobes reshape the continent?","bodyText":"In the House of Terror, one of Budapest’s most popular tourist attractions, two mannequins’ torsos stand back to back on a rotating platform, one wearing the uniform of Hungary’s communist secret police, the other that of the Arrow Cross fascist party. They bear mute testimony to the traumas of 20th-century history in this corner of Europe. Mária Schmidt, the museum’s director, says she would like to show her display to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, thus reminding her that in 1945 Hungary was occupied by the two most brutal totalitarian regimes of the last century in the space of a single year. This would, she believes, explain why the country remains fiercely proud of its independence and suspicious of “neocolonial attitudes” towards eastern Europe from Brussels. “We are Hungarians, and we want to preserve our culture,” Schmidt says, sitting in the museum’s boardroom. “We don’t want to copy what the Germans are doing or what the French are doing. We want to continue with our own way of life.” When the German chancellor visited Budapest in 2009, Schmidt claims she sent her an invitation to a commemorative event but got no response. “There is only one explanation for this,” she says. “She has a heart of ice.” A historian who once wrote acclaimed books about the Holocaust, Schmidt is now seen in Hungary as intellectual-in-chief to the country’s avowedly illiberal prime minister Viktor Orbán, whose government subsidises the museum and a number of think tanks directed by her. Like Orbán, she is no fan of refugees. Schmidt rejects the term for the thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan and other war-torn countries who were left stranded at Budapest’s Keleti station in the summer of 2015, insisting they were “migrants” because they had already crossed several borders on their journey to the heart of the continent. “We used to fight Turkish invaders and were occupied by the Turks for 150 years,” she says. “We know the consequences that certain kinds of contacts may entail.” Schmidt dismisses the argument that European economies need immigration to make up for declining demographics and, in Hungary’s case, high levels of emigration: “The Hungarians who have emigrated will eventually come back because they will realise it is better here than anywhere else,” she says, adding that “automation and artificial intelligence are creating new kinds of methods of production” that require a smaller labour force. “There is a debate about the future of Europe: whether it can remain an alliance of nation states, or whether it should become an empire. I don’t believe in empires. Where is the Soviet Union now? Where is the Third Reich? Where is the Ottoman empire? Where is the British Empire? Meanwhile, Hungary is still here. This is a state which is 1,100 years old.” “Germany, by comparison, is a young country,” Schmidt adds, raising her voice. “I don’t like being lectured by people who couldn’t even set up a nation state before 1871.” Schmidt’s office later emailed to clarify that she had intended this as a joke. Increasingly, there are signs that Schmidt and Orbán have the ambition to take their brand of “illiberal democracy”, with its constant attacks on liberal freedoms and its disdain for Muslim migrants perceived to be undermining the country’s Christian identity, to another level. “Twenty-seven years ago here in central Europe we believed that Europe was our future; today we feel that we are the future of Europe,” the Hungarian prime minister told an audience in Romania last July, sketching out a scenario whereby Hungary would no longer just obstruct Brussels but begin to shape the continent in its image. And as the fallout from the 2015 refugee crisis continues to divide east and west Europe, Orbán gathers copycats and admirers across the former Soviet bloc. Since Poland’s 2015 general election the conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) has found itself entrenched in a constant stand-off with EU leaders over its plans to overhaul its constitutional court – a battle similar to one fought in Hungary in 2013. As with Orbán’s assault on the judiciary, human rights NGOs and press freedom, Polish cities have seen large-scale protests by a younger generation, with thousands of people taking to the streets to protest against restrictions on women’s rights in the spring of 2016. In the Czech Republic, president Miloš Zeman managed to secure his re-election last weekend by running a campaign from the Orbán playbook, painting his liberal opponent Jiří Drahoš as a pro-immigrant elitist with ties to Merkel. Even Austria, governed since December by a right-leaning coalition which includes Heinz-Christian Strache’s rightwing Freedom Party (FPÖ), has not been immune to the Hungarian leader’s populist charm. Orbán, who expects to extend his rule at elections in April, last Tuesday boarded a humble Railjet train to meet the new Austrian prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, in Vienna and declared a “fresh start” in Austrian-Hungarian relations: a symbolic westward extension of the Visegrád group – the post-cold war alliance formed in the early 1990s between Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – with a dash of old Habsburg glamour. This November marks the centenary of the collapse of the Habsburg empire, ruled for the last stretch of its 650 years by a dual monarchy from Budapest and Vienna. For Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political scientist at Vienna’s Institute of Human Sciences, the anniversary is crucial for understanding the new anti-Brussels axis running through the continent. “In central and eastern Europe, the disintegration of the Habsburg empire resulted in the emergence of interwar ethnic states,” he says. “But these states were highly unstable because of the rivalries built up before the war.” Eastern European resentment over the refugee crisis had thrived because many states in the region still associate ethnic diversity with the tumultuous years between the wars. In his 2017 book After Europe, Krastev sketches out how the genocides and migration waves of the war years replaced a previously multicultural Austrian-Hungarian empire, where parliaments at times allowed delegates to speak in any of eight languages, with a region of ethnically homogenous nation states. Eventually, some of them signed up to the philosophy that states should be founded on a homogenous culture, a 19th-century western idea. Now that Germany had suddenly changed its mind about multiculturalism in the 21st century, why should they follow suit again? If the story of the Austro-Hungarian empire and its collapse can explain the deeper dynamics of the new rift between eastern and western Europe, it also hints at where Orbán’s conservative counter-revolution may come up against its limits. “There is a widespread view in central and eastern Europe that multinational empires were fated to collapse, because the western powers and historians spent decades telling them that they were,” says Philipp Ther, a professor of central European history at Vienna university and author of the prizewinning Europe Since 1989: A History. “In fact, in Austro-Hungary’s case, it was full of life and managed to gradually democratise, a lot more so than Prussia. “But there won’t be a revival of Austro-Hungary now,” Ther says. “On the contrary: we will see growing conflicts between Austria and Hungary in the coming years.” Austria’s vice chancellor Strache may have argued the case for Austria joining the Visegrád group in last year’s election campaign. But his own Freedom Party has been just as vocal about the need to hinder eastern European migrants’ access to the Austrian welfare state: plans to index benefits for children of Hungarian migrant workers is one of his government’s signature policies. Eastern European governments, including Orbán’s, have announced their intention to oppose the measures – in Brussels, naturally. Austria, meanwhile, has announced its intention to sue Hungary for plans to expand a nuclear power station near the Austrian border, which is financed with a Russian loan of over €1bn. The Visegrád group, a loose network without any joint institutions or binding agreements, was partly set up as a post-imperial project from which the old power player in the region, Vienna, was deliberately excluded. The Austrian right, meanwhile, is less keen on seeing Poland as part of an eastern alliance, because it would no longer be the biggest and most powerful player. Stoking nationalist sentiments has helped Orbán win elections but could eventually back his country into a demographic dead end. The economies of Poland and the Czech Republic already draw vast numbers of guest workers from the Ukraine. Hungary, on the other hand, speaks a complex language that has more in common with Finnish and Estonian than the Slavic tongues of its neighbouring states, and offers wages which are unattractive even to Hungarian minorities in Slovakia. “Orbán doesn’t have the intellectual potential to become a leadership figure for the post-American European right,” argues Ther. “His notion of ‘illiberal democracy’ is a phrase, but not a concept with real foundation.” Zeman’s courting of trade with China and Russia has drawn ire from Brussels and Berlin, but there are also western economists who concede that eastern European states may have to rebalance their economic models to avoid being stuck in what some call the “Europeanisation trap”. In a recent post for his blog at Le Monde, economist Thomas Piketty argued that the returns western investors have drawn from the Visegrád Four more than exceed capital flows heading the other way. Yet, for now, Germany remains by far the most important export and import partner for each of the four Visegrád countries and Austria. Any move toward political divergence finds itself up against years of economic convergence. “Nationalism used to be about your army or your economy,” says Krastev. “Now it is very much about the politics of culture, which is why people like Mária Schmidt are so important to Viktor Orbán.” But the culture wars that galvanise support for Orbán in Hungary do not automatically work in Poland or Slovakia. In January the Hungarian foreign office abruptly cancelled a Future of Europe conference it had organised to mark the country’s presidency of the Visegrád Four. Schmidt says the conference had been postponed until May because it been caught “in the cross-hairs of political attacks” ahead of the April election. But some speculate that the conference was called off because the list of invited speakers, including alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, proved too unpalatable for some of the other co-hosting governments. As pessimistic as Krastev is about the future of the European Union, he is even more sceptical about Orbán’s conservative counter-revolution. “In a strange way, the success of every revolution is legitimised by the counter-revolution. I don’t believe we can restore nation states. And, at any rate, such nation states have a very short history. We are trying to make normal something that was very unusual.” After a pause, he adds: “Of course, the problem is that the fact that no one really wants to destroy the European Union isn’t a guarantee that it isn’t going to disintegrate. Disintegration of empires is rarely an intention – it’s usually a traffic accident. Empires tend to disintegrate from the centre, not from the periphery. “If Hungary were to leave the EU, no one would notice. The problem with the European Union comes when Germany decides it no longer has the patience to deal with this mess.” MITTELEUROPA TURNS RIGHT Austria Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of the centre-right Austrian People’s Party rules in a coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party. The parties have stated their intention to curb benefits for migrants from other EU member states and restrict cash payments for asylum seekers. While explicitly ruling out a referendum on EU membership, Kurz said the European Union should focus more on “big issues” and not “small issues on which nations or regions can better decide for themselves”. Receiving Viktor Orbán in Vienna this week, Kurz stated his aim to become “a bridge-builder between the Visegrád states and the countries in western Europe” Czech Republic President Miloš Zeman, one of the last remaining active leaders from the region’s post-Soviet transition period, last weekend managed to get reelected by beating an opponent he derided as a pro-immigrant elitist with ties to Angela Merkel. Zeman surrounds himself with business advisers with connections to Moscow and Beijing and opposes sanctions against Russia. Prime minister Andrej Babiš hails from rightwing populist party ANO but advocates close economic ties with the European Union. Hungary Campaigning is underway for a national poll on 8 April that is expected to result in the reelection of prime minister Viktor Orbán of Fidesz. Hungary’s government has clashed with Brussels over its opposition to distribution quotas for refugees and judicial reforms that critics have described as “a serious risk to the rule of law”. A new law, dubbed the “Stop Soros Plan”, looks designed to curb the influence of Hungarian-born financier George Soros, who founded the Central European University and donates to the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human-rights group. Poland Poland has been engaged in a two-year legal battle with Brussels that has been prolonger rather than curtailed by a government reshuffle and the appointment of a new PM, Mateusz Morawiecki. The Polish government has been battling to control the constitutional court, a move which critics say puts the country on a road to autocracy. On Thursday, the Polish government passed a libel bill that allows jail sentences for those accusing the Polish population of collaborating in the Holocaust or other war crimes. Slovakia Slovak prime minister Roberto Fico has his own history of clashing with the rest of the EU, describing the bloc’s migration policy in January 2016 as “ritual suicide”. But Slovakia is also the Visegrád group’s only member of the eurozone, and Fico last October insisted that ties with western Europe were more important for his country than solidarity with its Eastern European neighbours, describing his country as “a pro-European island in this region”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2019/feb/06/trump-news-latest-live-state-of-the-union-reaction-sotu-2019-democrats-ocasio-cortez","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-07T01:00:03Z","webTitle":"Virginia: woman who accused lieutenant governor of sexual assault speaks out – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/06/trump-news-latest-live-state-of-the-union-reaction-sotu-2019-democrats-ocasio-cortez","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/06/trump-news-latest-live-state-of-the-union-reaction-sotu-2019-democrats-ocasio-cortez","fields":{"headline":"Virginia: woman who accused lieutenant governor of sexual assault speaks out – as it happened","bodyText":"It was a quiet ending to an eventful day. Thanks for sticking with us, everyone. The Virginia saga continues with a Virginia congresswoman issuing a brief but damning tweet in support of the woman accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. Paul Erickson, the Republican operative boyfriend of Maria Butina (the Russian national who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to influence US politics during the 2016 presidential election) was indicted by a federal grand jury in South Dakota in an entirely separate case involving a chain of assisted living homes. Paul Erickson, the boyfriend of Maria Butina, the Russian national who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to influence US politics during the 2016 presidential election, was indicted by a federal grand jury in South Dakota on charges of wire fraud and money laundering, the Daily Beast is reporting. The case against Erickson, a conservative US political activist and National Rifle Association insider, does not appear to be linked to the foreign agent case against Butina, who tried to infiltrate the NRA and relay intelligence on American politicians to a Russian government official. Erickson was arrested on Feb. 6 and entered a plea of not guilty, according to the court filings. The indictment alleges that Erickson ran a criminal scheme from 1996 to 2018 using a chain of assisted living homes called Compass Care. Erickson also allegedly defrauded investors through a company called Investing with Dignity that claimed to be “in the business of developing a wheelchair that allowed people to go to the bathroom without being lifted out of the wheelchair.” The indictment says he also ran a fraudulent scheme that claimed to be building homes in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota. Lawyers for Erickson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Virginia Congresswoman spoke out in support of the woman accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill today, Elizabeth Warren couldn’t say whether she had identified as Native American in other legal documents besides her Texas state bar registration. Cory Booker has now weighed in the allegation of sexual assault against Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor of Virginia. Although Booker has called on Ralph Northam to resign over his blackface scandal, he didn’t go quite as far with Fairfax. Kamala Harris avoided criticizing Elizabeth Warren, her rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, when asked about the latest flap over Warren’s claims of Native American heritage.

A local reporter in Virginia tweets that they are working on getting a photo of Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring in blackface. CNN will hold a town hall with billionaire Howard Schultz, who is considering mounting an independent presidential bid, next week in Texas. Schultz, who made his fortune running Starbucks, has received significant national attention for his flirtation with a centrist bid for the White House. However, much of it has not been positive. Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office today that he doesn’t think that Stacey Abrams can beat incumbent Republican David Perdue if she runs for Senate in Georgia in 2020. Abrams, who was the losing Democratic gubernatorial nominee in the Peach State in 2018, delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Union on Tuesday night. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney criticized the presidential campaign of her fellow New Yorker Kirsten Gillibrand today and suggested that Gillibrand can’t win a general election. In an interview with the New York Daily News, Maloney said “I’m not supporting her because I feel, at this point, I feel that we have to win Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin,” Maloney said. “And if we win Ohio, we win the presidency, in my belief. So I am very interested in candidates that I believe can win Ohio.” Instead, Maloney pointed to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas as candidates who could potentially win. Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown is already set to have one prominent endorser if the three-term senator decides to run for President. Vanessa Tyson’s full statement about Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and her allegations of sexual assault against him is posted below. Trump responds to Adam Schiff’s statement that the House Intelligence Committee will look into his financial affairs by attacking the Democratic congressman. “On what basis would he do that, he has no basis to do that, he’s just a political hack who is trying to build a name for himself,” said Trump, who went on to say that Schiff was engaging in “presidential harassment.” Trump condemned what he called “ridiculous partisan investigations” in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Vanessa Tyson, the woman who has accused Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, has issued a statement about the incident. “What began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault,” Ms. Tyson said, adding: “Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him. Speaking at the White House, President Donald Trump is formally announcing that David Malpass will be tapped to lead the World Bank. Malpass, the current under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, served in both the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations before becoming the chief economist at Bear Stearns. The House Intelligence Committee will continue investigation of allegations connecting Donald Trump and the Trump organization to money laundering. In a statement, Adam Schiff, the new Democratic chair of the committee, said: During the prior Congress, the Committee began to pursue credible reports of money laundering and financial compromise related to the business interests of President Trump, his family, and his associates. The President’s actions and posture towards Russia during the campaign, transition, and administration have only heightened fears of foreign financial or other leverage over President Trump and underscore the need to determine whether he or those in his Administration have acted in service of foreign interests since taking office. Unfortunately, these and numerous other avenues of inquiry were not completed during the last Congress. Republicans in a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on climate change questioned the overwhelming science that humans are causing rising temperatures, worsening extreme weather and triggering sea-level rise. That comes as government reports find 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record and that global warming could exceed a 1.5C increase within five years. Judith Curry, the retired chair of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is often called on by Republicans to highlight uncertainties about the causes and impacts of climate change, said there have been worse droughts and weather events in the past. Congressman Louie Gohmert, a Republican from Texas, suggested proposals for a Green New Deal to limit greenhouse gases would eliminate all overseas military bases and cut the military in half, leaving the country vulnerable to Russia, China and the Islamic State. Those type of military provisions have been part of the Green Party’s vision for a Green New Deal but are not part of ongoing discussions led by New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gohmert also asked Curry if humans are causing the polar ice caps on Mars to melt, adding “that’s probably the sun.” Colorado Congressman Doug Lamborn (R) suggested young people advocating for a Green New Deal may not have the life experience or maturity to understand that it’s “literally impossible.” Other GOP lawmakers said the transition away from fossil fuels would be too expensive, would hurt the poor and would be technologically infeasible. The Republicans’ comments come in stark contrast to Democrats, who highlighted the impacts of climate change in their own districts. New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland was tearing up when apologizing to youth climate activist Nadia Nazar for the problems her generation is inheriting. A new poll from CNN shows that only 22% of Americans support replacing all private health insurance with government health insurance, a stance controversially endorsed by Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Iowa last week. If all three scandal plagued Virginia Democrats resign, the identity of Virginia’s next governor may be determined by a bowl. Under Virginia’s constitution, fourth in line to be governor is the Speaker of the House of Delegates Kirk Cox. The Republican holds his position because of a narrow 51-49 in the Commonwealth’s lower chamber. There was a tie race for the deciding seat and the deadlock was broken by names from a bowl. The Republican’s name was chosen and instead of a House of Delegates evenly split on partisan lines, Republicans ended up with a one seat majority. This seems to be the current state of play among Virginia Democrats It is not every day that a Capitol Hill briefing on marginal tax rates draws a packed house. But these are unusual times. The attendance was perhaps due in no small part to congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to turn “arcane” policy matters, as one panelist described it, into progressive rallying cries. Since she suggested a 70% marginal tax rate on income exceeding $10 million, the proposal has spread like wildfire. It has already become a defining issue of the 2020 campaign and the idea was ridiculed by the billionaires gathered at Davos. On Wednesday, the House Progressive Caucus convened a panel of lawmakers, experts and economists to discuss how to translate the progressive plan into a legislative reality. “For the last 20, 25, 30 years we’ve not been allowed to talk about taxes – at all,” said Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. In a graphic showing countries’ total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product, the US unsurprisingly lagged behind Canada and Scandinavian countries. “What do you get out of that?,” he asked. “Health care. Free tuition. Paid leave. All of the social benefits we utterly lack in this country “ In brief remarks, Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats had for too long allowed conservatives to define progressive policies, which she said created the turned taxes into a “boogieman [with a] negative association”. “It should be a tool,” she said, to help pay for policies such as Medicare for all and a Green New Deal. The freshman Democrat from New York also noted that her conservative critics expected the proposal would create a “scandalous moment”. Instead, she pointed to polling showing that a majority of Americans, and a significant percentage of Republican voters support the concept. She said: “We respect the intellect of the public enough to trust them to understand what we have to say.” Virginia Senator Mark Warner told reporters on Capitol Hill that he was “shocked and disappointed” about attorney general Mark Herring wearing blackface in college. The two-term Democrat had previously called on Ralph Northam to resign after Northam’s disastrous press conference on Saturday. Former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu all but ruled out a presidential bid in an interview this morning. Landrieu, a member of a prominent Louisiana dynasty, drew national attention with his decision to take down Confederate statues in the Crescent City in 2017. This led to some hype that he might go from City Hall to the White House as a moderate Southern Democrat. However, he said when asked about a presidential bid on CNN this morning, “I don’t think so. A lot of people have asked me that. I never say never, but at this point in time I don’t think I’m going to do it.” Nancy Pelosi was skeptical of Trump’s proposal to cure childhood cancer while meeting with the House Democratic Caucus this morning. The House Intelligence Committee just voted to release all witness transcripts to the Department of Justice and to special counsel Robert Mueller. This was something Republicans had declined to do when they controlled the House and had been delayed since the Democratic takeover of Congress as Republicans took their time in naming members to the committee. As Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has now admitted to wearing blackface in college, details of a private meeting that Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who is facing an allegation of sexual assault, have just leaked out This is a good recap of the current state of politics in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Mark Herring has now issued a statement about wearing blackface at a party in 1980 where he says he dressed as rapper Kurtis Blow. Mark Herring, the second in line to succession to be Virginia’s governor says he wore blackface at a party in college. The governor, Ralph Northam, admitted to doing so in a dance contest and the first in line, lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, is facing an allegation of sexual assault. The far left Democratic Socialists of America have issued their response to Trump’s State of the Union speech last night and it is an attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The increasingly bizarre situation in Virginia has taken another turn. First, Governor Ralph Northam was plunged into a scandal over a racist photo on his medical school yearbook page. Although Northam insisted that it wasn’t him in the photo, he did acknowledge wearing blackface for a Michael Jackson dance contest in 1984. As Democrats almost universally called for Northam to resign, his lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, then faced an allegation of sexual assault, further complicating the situation. Fairfax has denied the allegation and insisted he had a consensual sexual encounter with the accuser. Now, it seems the third in line of succession, Attorney General Mark Herring may face his own scandal. It seems that Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan really didn’t enjoy the State of the Union last night. Democrats calling attention to climate change in dual House hearings are meeting resistance from Republican lawmakers. “The majority of Americans consider climate change to be a moral and economic imperative, and they’re absolutely right,” said House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva, from Arizona. He noted the last few years have been the hottest recorded and that ice sheets are melting faster than expected. Democrats who have taken control of the House for the first time since early 2011 are planning to focus on climate change throughout February. The House science committee will hold another hearing next week. Their efforts come as government scientists announce today that 2018 was the fourth hottest year on record and warn the “impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt.” Rep. Rob Bishop, the committee’s ranking Republican from Utah, jokingly thanked Grijalva for making February the month of climate change hearings. “I appreciate the fact that you picked the shortest month of the year to do that,” he said, adding that the panel should instead focus on black history month, wildfires and a maintenance backlog at the National Park Service. The committee has jurisdiction over the public lands handled by the Interior Department. Public lands and the fossil fuel development on them account for a significant portion of US greenhouse gas emissions. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) testified that his state has suffered from more intense hurricanes, mudslides in the mountains and drought that has killed crops. He said that transitioning to clean energy would save money spent on adaptation and healthcare. At a simultaneous House Energy and Commerce hearing on climate change, Republicans took aim at the Green New Deal, a proposal from some Democrats that is meant to eliminate inequity, create jobs and reduce the greenhouse gases that heat the planet. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts are expected to release a high-level document laying out the tenets of a Green New Deal this week. Illinois Rep. John Shimkus, the ranking Republican on that panel’s climate change subcommittee, said such a proposal would be “radical” and include “wealth transfer schemes.” He said a top-down strategy for reducing emissions “may not be the most realistic way to address the climate change problem.” Shimkus said fossil fuels and nuclear power will remain the top sources of power. The Bulwark has a tribute to Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official. It notes the unique career of the Anglo-American conservative activist and how rare it was for a figure like him to ever get a White House job. Sebastian Gorka is a man of many distinctions. He was one of the first Breitbart alums to be tapped to serve a U.S. president. The first deputy assistant to a president to also be a fugitive from justice in a foreign county. And the only White House employee to ever be confused with an Olmec head. In short: At some point in the medium-future, Donald Trump will be gone, the executive branch will return to something resembling normalcy, and people like Seb Gorka won’t be allowed within sniffing distance of political power. So we ought to appreciate him while we have him. Few presidential advisors ever struggled with security clearance the way Gorka did. Shortly before he was fired, he had his clearance revoked while he was on vacation. And even now, two years after his departure, the fact of his clearance is being investigated by the Democrats. Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard repeatedly refused to label Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator, as an “enemy or adversary” of the United States. In an interview on MSNBC, the four-term congresswoman from Hawaii declined to criticize Assad. Gabbard has visited Assad in Syria and has been one of the few American politicians to defend his regime, which is responsible for the death of over 500,000 people and led to five million people fleeing the country. The woman who accused Virginia lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault deserves “due process,” the chair of the Democratic National Committee said. “We need to always take these allegations seriously,” chairman Tom Perez said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, according to Politico. “I said this whenever this issue has come up. We must accord respect to an accuser and we must accord due process to the accused.” “I believe she is entitled to due process,” he said. Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was greeted by climate change protesters in New York Tuesday at an event where he said he would announce a decision about a 2020 presidential run by the end of the month. Demonstrators blasted the former Congressman for breaking a pledge not to accept campaign donations from donors in the fossil fuel industry, and pushed him to throw his weight behind the Green New Deal. “It’s a very corrosive influence. You can’t be taking money from the people you’re supposed to legislate against and regulate,” said Gustavo Gordillo, 31, a Democratic Socialists of America member from Manhattan, who joined a group of protesters outside the PlayStation theater, where O’Rourke was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey. “We want to make sure that we can count on him to propose an aggressive, comprehensive plan.” Organizers said they plan to target other potential Democratic presidential candidates to press them to get behind an aggressive climate plan. But O’Rourke, who lost a bid against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz last year but gained a national following in the process, has sparked a backlash among a small but vocal group of progressive activists who believe he is not liberal enough. O’Rourke was removed from a list of signers of Oil Change USA’s pledge not to accept fossil fuel money after Sludge reported that he got $430,000 from individuals working in the oil and gas industry. His spokesman told the Huffington Post he is “supportive of the concept” of a Green New Deal. In his interview with Winfrey at a taping of her program “Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations,” O’Rourke gave himself an end of the month deadline to decide on a presidential run, saying he wanted to help unify the country and make sure it lives up to its promise. “If I can play some role in helping the country to do that, by God I’m going to do it,” O’Rourke said. Pressed for a timeline on an announcement, he said, “The serious answer is really soon. Before the end of the month.” Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell is asking for prayers for her ailing husband, former Rep. John Dingell, saying his health has “entered a new phase.” The Congresswoman missed Donald Trump’s State of the Union Tuesday night to be with her 92-year-old husband. There’s a hint of progress in negotiations toward a border security deal before a stopgap government funding bill expires. “Hopefully the lesson has been learned that shutting down the government is not a legitimate negotiating tactic,” New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chair of the Democratic caucus, said at a press conference Wednesday. He said he was “cautiously optimistic” there would be a deal. Jeffries hinted at how a deal could come together: Democrats may be willing to support “enhanced fencing” in certain places, which could be an area of “bipartisan consensus.” “Some sort of physical barrier or medieval border wall from sea to shining sea is ridiculous,” he said, adding that much of the land that would be needed for such a wall is private property or sacred land for Native Americans. Former Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen has delayed planned testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, which had been scheduled for Friday, until Feb. 28. “In the interests of the investigation, Michael Cohen’s testimony has been postponed until February 28th,” Committee chairman Adam Schiff said, according to MSNBC. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he’s trying to talk his wife into running for Congress. “Listen, the state would be incredibly lucky if Mary Pat Christie would run for office,” the Republican said Tuesday night at a book signing, according to the New Jersey Globe. “I’ve been trying to convince her that maybe she should run for Congress. I think she would be fabulous.” If the former New Jersey first lady ran, it would be against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents Montclair. Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu is likely a no on running for president, he tells CNN this morning. Two undocumented immigrants who were employed by Donald Trump’s golf clubs were among the guests at the State of the Union. “It was hard to be face to face with him and realize he didn’t change his position, especially for those of us who helped his businesses prosper,” one of the women, Sandra Diaz, told the New York Times after the speech. “I had the trust to be inside his home and serve him.” Trump’s businesses have initiated a purge and fired a number of unauthorized immigrants since it was revealed that he for years employed people in the country illegally. Senator Bernie Sanders praised Stacey Abrams speech in response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union, calling it “very, very effective.” “Let me also just congratulate Stacey Abrams for her very, very effective response to President Trump’s State of the Union,” Sanders said Tuesday,” according to the Hill. “Now I think we all know why she would have been a great governor of Georgia.” The GOP, meanwhile, branded her with an unflattering nickname, Stacey Abrams’ speech in response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union is touching off speculation about a potential presidential run. The Georgia Democrat and former state representative made an unsuccessful run for governor last year, but came close in an overwhelmingly Republican state. The House intelligence committee is expected to vote Wednesday to send more than 50 interview transcripts from its now-closed Russia investigation to special counsel Robert Mueller, the Associated Press reports. It’s the panel’s first act since Democrats took control of the House. From AP: The panel’s new chairman, California Rep. Adam Schiff, has long said that sending Mueller the transcripts from the probe into Russian election interference would be one of his first actions. Two associates of President Donald Trump have already been charged with lying to the committee, and Schiff has said Mueller should consider whether additional perjury charges are warranted as part of the special counsel’s investigation. As is tradition, the committee will meet behind closed doors. A notice for the meeting says that one of the agenda items is “transmission of certain committee transcripts to the Department of Justice.” A person familiar with the meeting said the vote is to send the transcripts to Mueller’s office. The person asked not to be named because committee business is confidential. The vote comes the morning after Trump criticized “ridiculous partisan investigations” in his State of the Union speech. Schiff has indicated that he will re-open parts of the committee probe that Republicans closed last March, concluding there was no evidence of conspiracy or collusion between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign. Democrats strongly objected at the time, saying that the Republicans prematurely closed the investigation. Trump associate Roger Stone was charged with lying to the panel after Mueller requested his interview transcript, and the committee voted to release it. Among the transcripts now expected to be released are interviews with Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; his longtime spokeswoman, Hope Hicks; and his former bodyguard Keith Schiller. There are dozens of other transcripts of interviews with former Obama administration officials and Trump associates. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo penned an op-ed in the New York Times Wednesday responding to Donald Trump’s call in the State of the Union to outlaw abortion rules like the ones the state just passed. “Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth,” Trump said in the speech, also taking a shot at comments on the issue by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. “To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. He’s referring to New York’s Reproductive Health Act, which allows abortions after 24 weeks if the woman’s health is in danger or if the fetus would not survive outside the womb. Previously, abortions were barred after 24 weeks unless the mother’s life was at risk. Cuomo writes in the new op-ed: As part of their attack on women’s rights, Mr. Trump and his allies are intentionally spreading lies about New York’s Reproductive Health Act. Their goal is to end all legal abortion in our nation. The Reproductive Health Act guarantees a woman’s right to abortion in the first 24 weeks of a pregnancy or when the fetus is not viable, and permits it afterward only when a woman’s life or health is threatened or at risk. Contrary to what its detractors claim, the Reproductive Health Act does not allow abortions minutes before birth, nor does it allow third-trimester abortions “for any reason.” Third-trimester procedures are extremely rare, making up only about 1 percent of all abortions. The option is available for exactly the reason stated in Roeand successor cases: to protect the life or health of the woman. Although New York was a trailblazer in protecting a woman’s right to choose, we did not update our laws after Roe to conform with the right established by the Supreme Court, particularly regarding a woman’s right to make decisions to protect her health. And in an increasingly fractious political environment, there has been continual anxiety that the court will overrule the Roe precedent. He goes on: But these objections aren’t about the rare occasion when a woman has an abortion to protect her health or life. This is about the desire of Mr. Trump and allies on the right to outlaw abortion entirely. It is about bringing America back to the pre-Roe days. Mr. Trump and the religious right are spreading falsehoods about New York’s law to inflame their base. Activists on the far right continue to mislead with the ridiculous claim that the act will allow abortions up to a minute before birth. The Guardian’s Emily Holden is speaking to climate change experts who attended Trump’s State of the Union. Here’s what two of them had to say: A climate scientist and a former government expert in the audience for Donald Trump’s speech said this will likely be the last administration that can forego talking about climate change. Trump didn’t mention rising temperatures or extreme weather, although he did tout the country’s status as the top producer of oil and gas and boast about how quickly his officials have moved to cut regulations. In a wide-ranging speech, he claimed investigations of him would hurt the country and renewed his vows to build a wall on the southern US border with Mexico. Lisa Graumlich, dean of the environment college at the University of Washington, studies environmental systems and has used tree-ring data to understand long-term climate trends. She attended the State of the Union address as a guest of Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal. “I have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s…and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when peoples’ grandchildren were alive. And that has changed,” Graumlich said. “I don’t think that future presidents will find themselves in this position, because people are feeling the effects of climate change. There is, I believe, a stronger and stronger call for action.” Joel Clement, who resigned from the Interior Department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change impacts on vulnerable communities, now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree. “The Trump administration’s strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesn’t exist and pretend the science doesn’t exist even if it’s coming from its own agencies,” Clement said. “To not say anything about it is just ignorance, and it’s irresponsible.” New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot says Donald Trump’s pledge to end AIDS transmissions by 2030 is contradicted by his own policies. She said in a statement Wednesday morning: “President Trump’s pledge to end the HIV epidemic within 10 years is encouraging, but it is difficult to reconcile this statement with his Administration’s systematic assault on the HIV community – including undermining access to affordable health insurance and HIV drugs; cutting funds for HIV research; and attacking LGBTQ+ people...A pathway exists for the President to end the HIV epidemic, but he cannot reach this goal by alienating the very communities most affected by it. Any legitimate plan must begin by righting these wrongs.” A West Virginia woman has been indicted on charges she threatened to kill Donald Trump. From the Associated Press: A federal grand jury in Wheeling on Tuesday indicted 25-year-old Taryn Corrinne Henthorn of Middlebourne. Prosecutors say Henthorn made the threat on Facebook and elsewhere last month. Henthorn faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of three counts if convicted. It’s unclear if Henthorn has a lawyer. Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, mixing a rhetorical call for unity with a hard line on issues like immigration and abortion, and getting in a shot at “ridiculous partisan investigations,” which he claimed could ruin the economy. Democrats are unsurprisingly unimpressed. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday morning on CNN that Trump “was like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.” “And the excitement was all in the Mr Hyde part,” he said. “All the enthusiasm was on the divisive issues. It was not a good speech. The president is hurting, he knows he is hurting, but he doesn’t seem to be able to dig himself out of the hole.” Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams delivered the party’s response Tuesday night. But the substantive response comes today, when the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will kick off its legislative business in earnest. A House committee will hold its first hearing on gun violence in years, according to the Associated Press. Two other committees are holding hearings on climate change. Three will be discussing healthcare protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. “We have a lot of work to do,” Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, told AP. Democrats got a bit of a slow start with their legislative agenda because of the government shutdown, but are now trying to make up for lost time. On the schedule today, per AP: The House Judiciary Committee holds its first hearing on gun violence in at least eight years. The Natural Resources Committee kicks off a month of hearings on climate change, its first sustained look at the issue in a decade. The Foreign Affairs Committee will debate the war in Yemen, and consider a war powers resolution to halt U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led coalition. The Oversight Committee will hold a hearing on ethics in the executive branch. The Appropriations Committee will hold a hearing taking stock of the recent government shutdown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/dec/26/copeland-byelection-we-are-a-community-of-two-halves","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-26T17:00:26Z","webTitle":"Copeland byelection: 'We are a community of two halves'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/26/copeland-byelection-we-are-a-community-of-two-halves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/dec/26/copeland-byelection-we-are-a-community-of-two-halves","fields":{"headline":"Copeland byelection: 'We are a community of two halves'","bodyText":"The constituency that Jamie Reed will soon no longer represent is a curious one. One of the biggest and most remote in England, Copeland covers 470 sq miles and takes in Keswick and the western Lake District fells, as well as 32 miles of Cumbrian coast, from Millom up to Whitehaven. On paper, its inhabitants enjoy the third highest salaries in the UK – £721 a week, second only to the City of London and Tower Hamlets, according to the Office for National Statistics in 2015. But visit Whitehaven, the largest town in the constituency, and the wealth is not obvious. Cafes advertise full Christmas dinners for a fiver and a few miles out of town is the Woodhouse estate, which is within the 3% most deprived wards nationally, where a three-bed terrace still costs just £60,000. The reason for this disparity lies behind a big fence on a two sq mile site by the coastal village of Seascale: Sellafield, a nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site where the Windscale nuclear power station once stood. About 10,000 people are directly employed there, with thousands more in the supply chain, many in highly skilled engineering and scientific jobs. A further 6,000 are due to be employed in the construction of the Moorside nuclear power station, which is to be built next door in the next 10 years. NuGen, the Japanese-backed company behind the project, says Moorside will bring at least £20bn investment into the UK. “It is an unprecedented opportunity for this part of the world to become the fastest growing part of the UK economy,” said Reed, who is quitting politics for a role as head of development and community relations at Sellafield. “We are a community of two halves,” says Pat Graham, the managing director of Copeland borough council. “As a proportion of our workforce we have got more PhDs per head of population in Copeland than anywhere else in the UK. We have the nuclear-related wealth, which captures the highly skilled and the affluent and the upwardly mobile. But we also have those people who don’t have the ability to access nuclear, so therefore we have the extremes of really attractive, beautiful Lakeland places and poverty and all the challenges that come with deprivation.” In the EU referendum, Copeland voted by a margin of 62% to leave the EU. Reed was an outspoken remainer, warning constituents that their lives would be worse if the UK left. He was devastated – but not surprised – by the result, telling the Guardian that he had to take some of the blame. “It is the fault of people like me over a long period of time for not pointing out the benefits of the EU, for allowing myths to go unchallenged and to be cemented as facts in people’s minds,” he said. “It is a tragedy that communities like this have voted to leave a political body which very often did more for them than its national government ever did.” Reed points to numerous European-funded projects in Copeland, including the harbour redevelopment and the Westlakes Science park, home to engineering company Westlakes Engineering. Its managing director, Andy Hooper, voted to remain and was aghast at the result. “It seems so retrograde to leave. Why do we want to be so insular?” he said. His firm has designed safety systems for theme park rides across Europe and employed many EU graduates. He can see some positives from Brexit: “From a purely selfish point of view, I suppose we might benefit if it becomes harder for Sellafield and others to contract overseas firms.” But he doesn’t want to only be able to recruit from a small group of people. In the end, he’s trying to look on the bright side: “As an entrepreneur I think change is good and chaos can be creative.” Hooper is in the minority in Copeland. For the past 22 years Gerard Richardson has run a fine wine shop in Whitehaven town centre. He strongly objects to the idea that those who voted to leave did not understand the consequences. “The people who voted remain seem to think they are the only ones who made an educated choice. They think that those who voted out are white, thick, racist and unemployed. I’m only one of those,” said Richardson, a 54-year-old grandfather of eight. “It’s so arrogant. They seem to think that to vote leave you are some sort of little Englander flying the Union Jack in your garden.” He is not anti-European, he insisted – “I’m a fine wine merchant, for goodness sake.” He just did not think the EU and its institutions were fit for purpose. “I don’t have a problem with immigration. I just think Europe has become too unwieldy. When you’ve got a political class who can’t even decide on one home and so create two parliaments just to satisfy two different factions, you’ve got a problem.” Though he disagrees with Reed on Europe, Richardson respects him, he said. “If I want to talk to my MP, I know where I can find him. I don’t know who my MEPs are. I’ve never seen them campaign in Whitehaven. I’ve never known them to hold a surgery. I shouldn’t have to make an appointment with some pillock in Preston or Manchester. They should come up here. Educated people like us should know what their MEPs do and we don’t. All I know is their wages and expenses are phenomenal. Forget all that rubbish about giving £350m to the NHS. Get rid of all the bloody MEPs and use their money instead.” Though Reed is generally popular locally, his parliamentary majority has steadily reduced over three general elections. When he first became an MP, in 2005, he had a 6,320 majority. By 2015 that had reduced to 2,564, with the Tories second on 14,186 and Ukip third, gaining more than 5,000 votes on the previous election to win a 15.5% vote share. “They came out of nowhere like a great white shark,” Reed says of Ukip. The seat, with varying boundaries, has been Labour since 1935, but it cannot be considered in any way “safe”. Last May Copeland chose its first elected mayor, with voters shunning the Labour and Conservative candidates in favour of Mike Starkie, a local businessman who ran as an independent. Starkie voted for Brexit and was only surprised that even more people in Copeland didn’t follow suit. At his rugby club “everyone” seemed determined to vote out before the referendum, he said, including all the Sellafield workers. Drinking an afternoon pint in the Manor House pub in St Bees this week, one 58-year-old man working in a factory making chemicals on the Sellafield site, said he voted out because he couldn’t see how it would be detrimental. “I think we should be able to decide on our own laws,” he said. He knew Copeland would vote to leave. “Here in the real north-west of England – and I don’t mean Manchester or Liverpool – we are very isolated. Look at our infrastructure. We have two-carriage diesel trains and 300 people trying to get on them each morning to get to Sellafield. We don’t have a dual carriage way out. We are always the last in the pecking order.” Many local people complain about not being given their share from central government, particularly when the high wages paid contribute so much to the exchequer. They feel unfairly treated by the media too. In 2010 Fleet Street descended on the constituency following the gun rampage of a local taxi driver, Derrick Bird, who killed 12 people and then himself, painting a picture of a community riven with divisions few locally recognised. Four years later the pack came back after statistics suggested Whitehaven was the fattest place in England. Reed feels strongly that the government – and the Labour party – needs to stop neglecting areas such as Copeland, which are geographically and culturally so far away from Westminster. “Remotely accessible peripheral areas are overwhelmingly ignored by the centre of government and that has to change. I passionately believe that that sense of grievance is one of the principle factors which fuelled Brexit. “I’ve talked about our lower league towns, our rugby league towns, it’s true. It’s true that vast swaths of people in our country feel ignored and are unsure of their place in the national story. And that means they are unsure about their sense of worth as a community. And that’s not a good place to be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/occams-corner/2017/jan/12/why-do-people-persist-in-beliefs-that-are-wrong-and-even-harmful","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-12T12:15:01Z","webTitle":"Why do people persist in beliefs that are wrong – and even harmful? | Richard P Grant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2017/jan/12/why-do-people-persist-in-beliefs-that-are-wrong-and-even-harmful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/occams-corner/2017/jan/12/why-do-people-persist-in-beliefs-that-are-wrong-and-even-harmful","fields":{"headline":"Why do people persist in beliefs that are wrong – and even harmful?","bodyText":"Richard Feynman said that the easiest person to fool is yourself. Fooling yourself is a particular danger for the well-educated, who see themselves as smart; and who in all likelihood tend to hang around with like-minded people of similar background and experience. Because you’re smart, your ideas are necessarily good. The danger here is that a self-reinforcing herd mentality arises. Ideas become customs, and customs become Truth. Any deviation from the Truth is to be quashed, and outsiders are mocked and derided. Sometimes the idea around which such a herd coalesces can arise from a charismatic leader: somebody like Brian Cox for example – or Donald Trump. The motivations of such leaders are varied and mixed. Some motives are honourable – for example the desire to help people to live healthier lives; while others are more base – fame, power, money. Either way, the idea and the motive become subsumed over time by herd mentality, the need for disciples of the leader to feel that they belong. These themes are explored in depth in “Denying to the Grave”, by the daughter and father team of Sara E Gorman and Jack M Gorman. They look at several different issues (e.g. vaccination, keeping handguns at home, GMOs, nuclear power) and examine the reasons why people – even, and perhaps especially, well-educated people – maintain beliefs that are not just wrong but may in fact be harmful. As I’ve argued previously, such harmful beliefs do not arise from ignorance. The “knowledge gap” model of science communication is surely entirely discredited by now. And yet, when we observe worrying developments in society – certain appointments by the president-elect of the United States, for example – there is an overwhelming tendency to try to batter sense into people by showing the data on climate change, on measles mortality rates, and so on. This is important, but by itself simply does not work. Unless of course the intent is to signal to other members of your gang that you think the right way and you’re one of the good guys, in which case you’re winning in spades. But for those people who for example are (in reality) putting their children at risk by not having them vaccinated, opposition in the form of ‘facts’ confirms their own belief that they are doing the right thing – guided and aided of course by the charlatans at the centre of the harmful, self-reinforcing meme of which they are victims. Opposition builds their sense of belonging, encouraging a sense of emotional, even financial, security. Even more powerfully, there are strong evolutionary reasons why these beliefs persist even in the face of overwhelmingly contrary evidence. Apparent irrationality, argue the Gormans, can be a survival mechanism. Our species has got this far by making quick inferences based on scarce information, inferring causality where there may be none, and avoiding actions that have an infinitesimal risk of a nonetheless deadly outcome. We cannot easily escape our evolutionary chains. So what can be done? Strategies for communicating with people who do not act on a particular consensus of scientific evidence have to take into account certain principles, including the fact that the well-educated make irrational health decisions; that it’s not about a lack of information; that people are uncomfortable with uncertainty and don’t understand risk; and that people respond more to emotion than to statistics. There are a number of recommendations for science communicators in the book. Scientists must flood the internet with correct information – it’s a search engine battle. But they must also be more sensitive to difficulties in understanding causality and risk, in people’s discomfort with uncertainty and their own weaknesses. And yes, this is difficult for the well-educated, those who consider themselves keepers of the truth. But humility is essential: we all tend to think uncritically, and place emotion over reason. We need compassion, empathy and emotion in our communication. After all, we’re only human."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/sep/05/five-countries-at-g20-keen-on-uk-trade-talks-says-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-05T16:31:40Z","webTitle":"Six countries at G20 keen on UK trade talks, says Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/five-countries-at-g20-keen-on-uk-trade-talks-says-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/sep/05/five-countries-at-g20-keen-on-uk-trade-talks-says-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Six countries at G20 keen on UK trade talks, says Theresa May","bodyText":"China is among six countries at the G20 summit that are interested in trade talks with the UK, British officials have said, despite the US and Japan issuing warnings about the negative consequences of Brexit. Theresa May initially named India, Mexico, South Korea, Singapore and Australia as countries that would welcome initial discussions about enhancing free trade with the UK. A UK official source later said China had also been keen to explore direct trading relations with the UK after Brexit. “They specifically said China would be open to a bilateral trade arrangement. That is interesting to us as we leave the European Union,” the official said. May omitted the names of the majority of other countries at the summit in Hangzhou, China – including the US, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Indonesia, which appear to have given no such assurances. Three EU countries at the summit are not allowed to enter such negotiations outside the bloc. After meetings with almost every world leader at the G20, May said it had been a successful summit at which she pitched the UK as a global leader in free trade and saw others echo her warnings that some people felt left behind by globalisation. However, the UK prime minister has also had to endure some difficult discussions about the consequences of Brexit. After her first bilateral meeting with Barack Obama, May was warned that the US wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of Pacific nations before considering a deal with the UK. This was swiftly followed by a message from Japan that there could be a string of corporate exits from Britain unless some of the privileges that come with access to the single market are maintained. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told May he wanted more certainty about what Brexit would look like for Japanese companies that invest in the UK. May still faces a testing meeting with China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday, at which she will tell him there has been no decision yet on whether to let China invest in UK nuclear power. In a hint that she is contemplating Britain’s nuclear future without Chinese involvement, she said: “Our relationship with China is about more than Hinkley Point.” An official UK government source said this did not mean a decision had been made on whether plans for a new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset should go ahead. May’s reticence about Chinese investment in British nuclear power has been interpreted as a sign that she is more cautious about the so-called golden era of relations with Beijing heralded by David Cameron during Xi’s state visit last year. However, May said there would still be a “golden era” and strong partnership with Beijing. Her meeting on Monday with Xi is expected to last about half an hour. May angered Beijing by placing the French and Chinese-backed Hinkley nuclear project under review in July, apparently over security concerns. Since then there has been a suggestion that she could be happy for the Chinese to be a passive investor in Hinkley but does not want the country to have a more active role in developing a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk or Bradwell in Essex. On the way to Hangzhou, May gave an unclear answer about whether she trusted the Chinese. “Of course we have a relationship with them,” she said. “We are working with them. And we have seen significant Chinese investment into the United Kingdom. What I want to do is build on that relationship. But I also want to be able to build on relationships with other countries. I want to be unashamedly open to free trade and a global leader in free trade.” May was forced to insist that Britain still had clout at the G20 in the wake of warnings from remain campaigners that Brexit would cause the UK to lose status on the international stage. In Hangzhou, the UK has been excluded from some joint meetings involving EU leaders from France, Germany and Italy. May ended up on the fringe of a choreographed “family photo” of world leaders that had Obama, Angela Merkel and Xi at the front and centre. May said: “There has been no change, and that’s very pleasing actually. What I found at this summit was that some of the themes that I was raising about anti-globalisation, how the global economy works for everyone, were then echoed by other leaders around the summit. The UK is here and playing our full role as we always have done and will continue to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/19/the-snap-morning-after-leaders-debate-that-wasnt","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-19T05:40:46Z","webTitle":"The Snap: the morning after the leaders' debate that wasn't","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/19/the-snap-morning-after-leaders-debate-that-wasnt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/19/the-snap-morning-after-leaders-debate-that-wasnt","fields":{"headline":"The Snap: the morning after the leaders' debate that wasn't","bodyText":"What’s happening? Tim Farron is from Preston; Leanne Wood is not – despite the insistence of Paul Nuttall – called Natalie; Nicola Sturgeon is the self-styled leader of the resistance; Caroline Lucas might have been the winner; and the absence of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn didn’t stop Conservative and Labour HQs snarking about each other on Twitter. Is that all we learned from last night’s ITV leader-lite leader’s debate? Yes. If by any chance you’d like to relive it, our live blog, complete with Andrew Sparrow’s wearied conclusion, is right here. If the twin themes of the debate were Brexit and May taking her election win (and voters) for granted, they are themes that the day leading up to the debate did little to unseat. “At last, a PM not afraid to be honest with you,” is the Daily Mail’s cod liver oily headline this morning in response to a manifesto assembled by people seemingly confident that they could unveil an adult colouring book and not slip below a 12-point lead. “There is no Mayism,” May said at the launch, “only good solid Conservatism”, a less is more approach that stretched from the policy-light manifesto to the PM’s decision not to trouble herself with televised debates. (She prefers door-knocking, which might, it turns out, reach a not dissimilar number of people to last night’s ITV viewing figures.) The prime minister vowed to be “upfront and straight” as she announced plans for elderly people to fund their own social care, the means-testing of winter fuel payments, and the downgrading of the pensions triple lock – scolded as a “nasty party triple whammy” by Corbyn. Foxhunting and selective schools make it in. Out would go the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (already mortally wounded by the fact we’re enduring an election campaign right now), Leveson part two and the “tax lock” pledge not to raise national insurance or income tax. The single market and the customs union: also so over. You can read more on all the key points here, along with how it differs from David Cameron’s 2015 to-do list here. What you can’t read is the numbers. There were a few dabbed here and there: £4bn for schools (though £2.8bn of that is to cover rising pupil numbers); another £8bn a year for the NHS (not enough, say experts). But having derided Labour over its spending plans, the Tories decided to outsmart the nitpickers by simply not bothering to show its own costings, prompting Labour to label it an “84-page blank cheque”. Interviewed on BBC Newsnight on Thursday, defence secretary Michael Fallon conceded that even the policy – though the Tories are now calling it merely an “ambition”, despite copying and pasting it into the manifesto for the third time – to slash net migration had not been costed, “because we don’t know specifically what year we’re going to reach that point of reducing to exactly tens of thousands”. Perhaps that immigration policy is now so old it can pay for its own care. Today, May will not be knocking on individual voters’ doors to show them her scribbled sums because it’s the turn of the Scottish Conservatives to give their manifesto an airing. That curbing of winter fuel payments might not make it into this version; the block on another independence referendum before Brexit will. At a glance: The Guardian view on Theresa May’s manifesto: a new Toryism. Tories receive £50,000 from donor questioned by Serious Fraud Office. National Grid boss say Labour plan will stall green energy drive. Scottish Greens urge tactical voting to block Conservatives. Gina Miller targets voters with tailored Facebook ads. Poll position Perhaps voters really do pay attention to manifestos: an Ipsos Mori telephone poll for the Evening Standard, conducted after Labour set out its plans, pushed the party up eight points from last month to 34%, a campaign high. The Tories held steady at 49%, paring their lead from 23 to – I can’t really justify an “only” here – 15 points. The Lib Dems slithered from 13% in April to just 7%; the Greens (+2 to 3%) vaulted Ukip (-2 to 2%). Diary This morning we’ll have the Scottish Conservative manifesto from Ruth Davidson in Edinburgh. John McDonnell and Rebecca Long-Bailey will deliver Labour’s response to the overall Conservative plans. At noon, in Anglesey, Leanne Wood sets out Plaid Cymru’s ideas for a post-Brexit Wales. Tim Farron is out and about in Cheshire. Read these Lucky Marina Hyde was in the leaders’ debate spin room: Ukip always bring along a full nest of spinners: couple of sharp suits, a few local heavies, and one guy who looks like he might ask you to help him lift a sofa into the back of a van. ‘It would have been better if the other four had just agreed everything beforehand and just one of them had debated Paul,’ one explained. But another thought it couldn’t have gone better, ‘and he looks the part’. Does he? Paul Nuttall has two political outfits: one, the dark suit, which makes him look like the sort of passively-aggressed employee whose boss greets him daily with the words, ‘What you doing in that daft suit, Paul? You in court or something?’ And two, the tweed-on-tweed, which makes him look like the efit of a man wanted in connection with a roofing scam. Isabel Hardman, in the Spectator, says – for different reasons – that Corbyn was right not to attend the debate: I suspect for Corbyn, the decision not to go near this opposition-focused debate has much more to do with his own belief that this election should be fought on normal terms (ie, that Labour might win) … Corbyn may also have found it rather uncomfortable being ganged up on from the left by Caroline Lucas, Nicola Sturgeon and Leanne Wood, who gave the altogether more professional Ed Miliband a hard time in 2015. They might have asked him why he abandoned the principles of unilateral nuclear disarmament, for instance. Revelation of the day Just as interesting – OK, interesting might be a stretch – as what’s included in a party manifesto is what it leaves out. So what won’t be going “Forward, Together” with Team Theresa May? Air pollution doesn’t get a mention. On new nuclear power stations, a staple of previous Tory policy, not a murmur. Rail fares? Not stopping at this station. Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen: nothing to see here.

It’s also incomplete. The first line of the second paragraph finishes it: “Or at least we do for a while.” The saying is wrestling with itself; the unthinkable cannot always be easily corralled into narratives of shared understanding, and it’s this that Didion explores through the lens of the late 1960s, her own struggles with mental health and, notably the murders masterminded by Charles Manson. She calls the mercurial act of memory and rearranging “more electrical than ethical” – and at the opening night of Belvoir and State Theatre Company South Australia’s brilliant Mr Burns, no reference seemed more appropriate. Mr Burns is fittingly subtitled – A Post-Electric Play – but the comparison is closer than that; it’s a three-act play reckoning with the shape of the stories that make us human, give us faith, and create gods and monsters that we can comprehend and thus perhaps fight. In the play an unspecified – though clearly catastrophic and nuclear – disaster has struck the United States. A fire crackles; chairs form a bedraggled circle around it. They have clearly been salvaged and are hauntingly mismatched; Jonathon Oxlade’s set design consistently allows for the presence of unseen ghosts. A small group of people are talking. Drinking beer. Drinking Diet Coke. A rifle rests on top of a backpack. Led by Matt (the instantly likeable Brent Hill), they are trying to remember and recreate an episode of The Simpsons. The episode is Cape Feare (the one where the family goes into witness protection after Sideshow Bob threatens to kill Bart, culminating in a musical showdown on a houseboat). Of course, the episode is an extended visual and contextual reference to the 1991 film Cape Fear – itself a remake of the 1962 film, which was based on a 1957 novel. This being The Simpsons, the episode is dotted with numerous cultural touchstones: the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, Goldfinger, Reader’s Digest, late-night talk shows, The Night of the Hunter, and a collection of horror films – Psycho, Friday the 13th, Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare on Elm Street. This is important. The Simpsons is a product of American, and western, culture. It’s built on referential humour and parody, a clever cartoon that is itself now a critical cultural text, having shaped the language and comic expectations of a generation via these references; we think in quotations and metaphor, we remix ideas into memes. Of course a group of strangers, allied for now, would default to The Simpsons; it’s a base point for deeper cultural examination, a natural shared language. As they laugh about Moe’s panda-smuggling, or a road trip through a cactus patch, there’s a palpable sense of disquiet and danger; the group are never fully relaxed. When a stranger stumbles upon them, everyone pulls out a gun. Gibson (Mitchell Butel) brings with him a greater sense of the country’s destruction. He and the group ask about lost and long-loved faces in the hope someone may have run into them. The name of every survivor they have encountered has been written down just in case they can offer proof of life, or receive it, from a stranger they cross paths with. It’s desperately sad. Seven years later, the group is now running an amateur theatre company, presenting Simpsons episodes (complete with commercials) and chart hits to audiences. There’s a thriving reconstructionist circuit (we hear about Shakespeare and The West Wing troupes), but there’s real competition in the Simpsons specialty. It’s frequently funny – a discussion about which kind of wine people are ready to remember and luxuriate in (“people are ready for Status again”) – but every single person in the room is on edge as they perform. They’re afraid of illness from exposure. They’re afraid of violence blossoming, as commerce and capital is reintroduced to their lives. They have all been traumatised by the end of civilisation as they know it, and there is no clear path forward. In the third act, which takes place another 75 years after the second, we see how those campfire stories – the narratives that survived – have merged with fact and become myth. In the style of a passion play or an opera, the act is a hagiography of the Simpson family, a classical story of sung-through struggle. The music is choral, hopeful, tinged with Eminem’s Lose Yourself and Britney Spears’ Toxic, a little bit Broadway and a little bit ecclesiastical; enduring human turmoil repackaged with new gods. Part Cape Feare, part remembrance of the dead, the villain of the tale is no longer Sideshow Bob but Mr Burns (Butel), the elderly, evil owner of Springfield’s nuclear power plant. Of course. Bart (Esther Hannaford) is the boy prince and protagonist who must face this representation of the force that destroyed, more or less, the world that came before. Director Imara Savage, one of the sharpest talents on Australian stages, has created a production that crackles and burns – comic and melancholy and unsettling – and the cast (Hill, Butel, Hannaford, Jude Henshall, Ezra Juanta, Jacqy Phillips, Paula Arundell) is outstanding. In particular, Butel’s Mr Burns is a slippery incarnation of human fear, slick and playful and cartoonish and wrong. And Hannaford’s solemn Bart is heart-breaking: a boy against the weight of the world. Savage – alongside music director Carol Young, who brings Michael Friedman’s score to urgent life – interrogates the impulse to connect via shared narratives. When her actors share a remembered line from a Simpsons episode or sing out in harmony, they are themselves again, momentarily protected from a precarious new reality. Anne Washburn’s play tracks the birth, evolution and apotheosis of story amid the darkest of times. At the same time, it is an acknowledgement of the potential of theatre itself, how it provides a space for ritual in a secular world, a communal opportunity for feeling and reflection; how when at its best it changes with the times to best serve the people who will see it. Mr Burns never tries to explain to us why we need stories. Instead it places our impulse to make sense of the senseless through story as something ineffably human, enduring forever. • Mr Burns, a co-production with State Theatre Company of South Australia, runs at Belvoir St Theatre in Sydney until 25 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2016/feb/16/edf-extends-life-of-four-nuclear-reactors-hinkley-point-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-16T09:01:16Z","webTitle":"EDF extends life of four nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/edf-extends-life-of-four-nuclear-reactors-hinkley-point-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/feb/16/edf-extends-life-of-four-nuclear-reactors-hinkley-point-decision","fields":{"headline":"EDF extends life of four nuclear reactors","bodyText":"EDF plans to extend the life of four nuclear power plants in the UK and has said it is close to announcing a decision on its investment in two new reactors at Hinkley Point. The French energy company said the lives of the Heysham 1 and Hartlepool plants would be extended by five years until 2024, and the closure dates of Heysham 2 and Torness will be delayed by seven years to 2030. The decision will preserve 2,000 jobs and help with tight energy supplies as Britain manoeuvres to keep power flowing during future winters. The plants provide electricity for about a quarter of British homes. EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, announced the extensions as it reported a 68% plunge in profits last year and cut its annual dividend. The company, which has been hit by falling power prices, said net debt increased by €3.2bn (£2.5bn) to €37.4bn. The fall in EDF’s annual net profit to €1.19bn was caused by a tripling of provisions, asset writedowns and other one-off items to €3.64bn. EDF surprised markets by cutting its dividend to €1.10 a share after paying €1.25 for the previous three years. But the company restated the appeal of the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset. EDF has delayed deciding on the plan due to funding problems, according to reports in France. It said: “Hinkley Point C is a strong project which is fully ready for a final investment decision and successful construction. Final steps are well in hand to enable the full construction phase to be launched very soon.” A final decision has been pending since October, when China’s state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The deal with EDF and CGN to build Hinkley Point was backed strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne. At the time, EDF said work would begin within weeks to build the two reactors. The company’s share price has fallen by about 40% since the announcement. EDF’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, said on Tuesday that the decision on Hinkley Point was “coming closer”, according to Reuters. He said EDF was negotiating final details with CGN and looking at how to finance the operation in the light of low electricity wholesale market prices. Paul Dorfman of the UCL Energy Institute said EDF’s financial position cast doubt on the prospects for Hinkley Point. “Unfortunately, with the best will in the world, it may just not happen,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. “EDF shares have crashed to half their value a year ago; the budget for Hinkley alone is bigger than EDF’s entire market value.” Greenpeace said EDF and the French government were in disarray over the cost and risk of the Hinkley project. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s policy director, said: “EDF’s accounts show growing debts and falling earnings. Hinkley is a bad investment and most people with an ounce of financial acumen have now come to realise this. George Osborne stands alone in defending Hinkley’s honour.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/10/government-review-swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-10T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Government review likely to back Swansea Bay tidal lagoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/10/government-review-swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/10/government-review-swansea-bay-tidal-lagoon-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Government review likely to back Swansea Bay tidal lagoon","bodyText":"Plans for a pioneering tidal power lagoon in Swansea Bay are expected to be supported by a government-commissioned report this week, potentially unlocking a multibillion-pound series of projects harnessing electricity from the rise and fall of the tide around the UK. When ministers last year ordered a review to see if the technology could affordably provide green energy to the UK, it was widely seen as a way to kill off an ambitious project at Swansea proposed by Tidal Lagoon Power. But when the independent review by former energy minister Charles Hendry is published on Thursday, sources told the Guardian it will be broadly positive towards the £1.3bn prototype plan. Swansea is seen as the “pathfinder” ahead of five major plants around the country, at Cardiff, Newport, Colwyn Bay in north Wales, the Cumbrian coast and Bridgwater Bay in Somerset. Together they could provide about a tenth of the UK’s electricity needs and help meet carbon targets. Hendry has visited communities which would potentially be involved in or affected by the lagoons, which he said had attracted “high expectations”. Tidal Lagoon Power has spent £35m on the Swansea project, which would see a U-shaped breakwater built across the bay and the incoming and outgoing tide passing through 16 turbines, generating enough power to supply 150,000 homes with electricity. But the developer and government officials have not yet been able to reach agreement on a guaranteed price for electricity from the lagoon. Negotiations are continuing on a price that would be even higher than the one agreed for the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and paid for by a levy on energy bills. Shortly before the tidal review was commissioned in February 2016, the then prime minister, David Cameron, said his enthusiasm had been reduced because of fear of high costs. Ben Caldecott, associate fellow at the liberal conservative thinktank Bright Blue, said: “The key thing is for tidal to demonstrate it can be a cost-competitive renewable technology without subsidy – if not today, then soon. Other renewable technologies have achieved this.” Mark Elborne, president of General Electric UK, which is linking up with Tidal Lagoon Power to provide the generators in the Swansea turbines, said the government should take the long view on the technology. “On the face of it some might say the cost per megawatt hour for Swansea Bay looks pricey. However, even as a one-off project the fact that it is only partially index-linked means it already comes in cheaper than Hinkley’s £92.50 per MWh. But the point is it is cannot and should not be seen as a one-off project, because it is not,” he said. He added: “Swansea is a prototype for a series of much bigger lagoons across the UK. Because bigger lagoons are able to pass far greater volumes of water through their turbines they are guaranteed to generate far cheaper power.” The company believes that if the six projects were completed at scale, they could together provide 12% of the UK’s electricity for about the same subsidy as onshore wind or solar power today. Mike McNicholas, managing director of the infrastructure division at Atkins, another partner in the Swansea scheme, said tidal lagoons could demonstrate the UK was still capable of the sort of engineering ingenuity seen in the Victorian era. “As an island, tidal lagoons are a game-changing solution for harnessing our most reliable and abundant natural asset – the tide.” Industry also thinks that prospects for tidal power are rosier under a new ministerial team at the Department for Business of Energy and Industrial Strategy, and in the light of government backing for Hinkley and a third runway at Heathrow.

Five years after a magnitude nine earthquake triggered a giant tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people along the north-east coast of Japan and caused a triple meltdown at Fukushima, the plant has been transformed from the scene of a major disaster into a sprawling building site. Masuda can point to lower radiation levels in and around the plant, better conditions for its 1,200 Tepco staff and 6,000 other workers – including the recent provision of hot meals and a rest area – and progress in containing huge quantities of radioactive groundwater. In late 2014, the utility overcame arguably the most dangerous challenge since the meltdown, with the removal of hundreds of spent fuel rods from a storage pool inside a damaged reactor building. But work on removing the melted fuel – something no nuclear operator has ever attempted – has barely begun. All that Tepco knows for certain – although it was slow to admit it – is that fuel in three reactors melted down after the tsunami knocked out the plant’s cooling system on 11 March 2011. Of greatest concern, though, is reactor 1, where the fuel may have burned through the pressure vessel, fallen to the bottom of the containment vessel and into the concrete pedestal below – perhaps even outside it – according to a report by the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning. Reactors 2 and 3 are thought to have suffered partial meltdowns. Masuda and Tepco engineers who spoke to the Guardian conceded that they still didn’t know where the fuel is located. “To be honest, we don’t know exactly where the fuel is and have to carry out more studies,” Masuda said at a recent briefing. “But we do know that the fuel is in a solid state of cold shutdown. “No one has ever done what we’re doing, but 30 to 40 years is a target that we can work towards. There are so many people involved that it would be wrong to alter that deadline on a whim. We’ve established a goal and need to show ingenuity to reach it, not take the easy way out.” The technology needed to send robots deep into the reactors’ bowels – where radiation levels are dangerously high – has yet to be developed. Two robots specially tailored to negotiate debris inside damaged tunnels and pipes stalled last year when they closed in on the reactors’ highly radioactive innards. Yet Tepco is persisting with the government’s roadmap for the Fukushima cleanup, which envisions fuel removal to begin in 2021 and end between 30 and 40 years later, at an estimated cost of almost $20bn (£14bn). But Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany, said the decommissioning schedule was an attempt to convince the public that Japan was recovering from a major nuclear disaster. “The idea that fuel debris removal will begin in 2021 is not realistic – it’s just not going to happen,” he said. “The roadmap is based on political considerations, not technical ones. “This applies to the government’s and industry’s approach to the whole Fukushima crisis – to give the impression that things are retuning to normal and to weaken public opposition to the restart of nuclear reactors. “No one really knows how long it will take, but it will be decades and decades and decades.” As the deadline for the start of fuel removal edges closer, even industry regulators are beginning to question the methods set out in the current decommissioning plan. Last month, Toyoshi Fuketa, a nuclear regulatory authority commissioner, suggested removing all of the melted fuel could take much longer than four decades. “I wonder if it is desirable for work to extract fuel debris to still be going on 70 or 80 years from now,” Fuketa told reporters. “There are a number of other options, including removing as much fuel as possible and solidifying the rest.” Fukushima Daiichi’s stability is wholly dependent on water constantly being directed into the reactor basements to prevent the fuel inside from heating up. While the method has proved effective, it has led to a buildup of enormous quantities of contaminated water – a mixture of the coolant and groundwater that becomes radioactive when it flows from hills behind the plant into the reactor buildings. The contaminated water is then pumped out and stored in tanks that cover large areas of the Fukushima Daiichi site. Tepco is able to remove 62 radionuclides from contaminated water – but not tritium – and has so far been unable to get permission from local fishermen to release the treated water into the Pacific Ocean. While pumping out groundwater upstream and redirecting it into the sea has reduced the amount flowing into the reactor basements from 400 tonnes to 150 tonnes a day, the technology that was supposed to deliver a coup de grace to Tepco’s perennial water problem has encountered problems. The utility’s plans to activate a 32bn yen (£198m) impermeable frozen wall, which was completed earlier this year, have been frustrated by delays and questions about its effectiveness. It hopes to start filling the underground wall’s maze of pipes with water later this year. The site is nearing its current water storage capacity of 850,000 tonnes, and there are plans to add to the existing 1,000 tanks, bringing the amount of contaminated water at the plant close to one million tonnes. Tepco expects to have collected and treated all contaminated water pooled around the reactors by 2020, and will need to continue processing only coolant water for the reactors, according to Sadanobu Kanno, a general manager in the firm’s nuclear power and plant siting division. The slow progress at Fukushima is mirrored in the painstaking effort to make nearby towns and villages, abandoned five years ago, fit for human habitation. The disaster forced 160,000 people to flee their homes, 100,000 of whom are still displaced. About 10,000 children whose families fled after the nuclear disaster have yet to return to Fukushima prefecture, amid parental concern over the possible health effects of long-term exposure to relatively low doses of radiation. Their former hometowns have since been turned into temporary dumping grounds for more than 10m black bags containing soil and other low level radioactive waste cleared from areas around homes, schools and other public buildings. Here, too, progress is slow, with local authorities reporting that more than 40 communities have yet to be decontaminated. The unprecedented cleanup, involving 26,000 workers, aims to reduce outdoor radiation exposure to one millisievert a year – a target Japan’s environment minister recently criticised as unrealistically low. But in a blow to the government’s push to lift more evacuation orders in Fukushima communities over the next 12 months, a poll published on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the disaster showed that two out of three nuclear evacuees had given up hope of ever returning to their homes. “It is wrong for the central government to say return home and to lift evacuation orders, even though its own declaration of an emergency situation for the nuclear accident is still in place,” said Miyako Kumamoto, a 73-year-old evacuee, at a rally in Tokyo last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/live/2018/may/11/county-cricket-surrey-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-11T17:50:22Z","webTitle":"County cricket: Surrey v Yorkshire, Somerset v Hampshire and more – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/live/2018/may/11/county-cricket-surrey-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/live/2018/may/11/county-cricket-surrey-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-hampshire-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"County cricket: Surrey v Yorkshire, Somerset v Hampshire and more – as it happened","bodyText":"And here’s a roundup of today’s action: Here are your scores on the doors at stumps: Division One: Notts 133; Lancashire 157-4 Hampshire 198-8 v Somerset Surrey 366-7 v Yorkshire Essex 177; Worcestershire 47-0 Division Two Derbyshire 301-4 v Durham Kent 215; Sussex 69-4 Leicestershire 191; Glamorgan 82-0 Middlesex 356-6 v Gloucestershire Northants 256; Warwicks 100-4 Thanks for reading and commenting. We’re back tomorrow. Bye. Play has just been abandoned for the day at Taunton with Hampshire 198 for eight. It’s hard to assess the worth of that score. But I’m fairly sure that Somerset will be relieved since they bowled so poorly in the first session before Tom Abell’s three wickets and a fine final spell from Lewis Gregory rescued the situation. By the same token Hampshire will surely be disappointed by the way their innings subsided from 86 for one. My guess is that the loss of just over a session will not prevent a result here. The pitch is used but today it was most helpful to the quicker bowlers – even so it was mildly uplifting to see Somerset with an old-fashioned, balanced attack with two spinners, Jack Leach and Dom Bess. They should get some work later in the game. Those trying to impress Ed Smith – I’m thinking of James Vince and Craig Overton – will be disappointed, especially Overton who was unusually off-target and impatient. Ollie Pope has just reached his second century of the season and third in 10 first-class matches in all – 174 balls with 16 fours. He has helped Surrey turn this day around. They have recovered from 69 for four and 162 for six to reach 310 for 7 with a little more than 11 overs remaining in the day. Whether we get them all, due to the light, I’m not sure. Warwickshire are trying desperately to gain some control of this breakneck opening day at Edgbaston, with Ian Bell unbeaten on 19 and the score 56 for three in reply to Northamptonshire’s 256. Jonathan Trott was the man to depart just now, pinned lbw by Brett Hutton after a couple of trademark whips through the onside. Sam Hain is new to the crease and Hutton is probing way. The floodlights are on and we have 16 overs to go. Northants, from 52 for six at one stage this morning, are very much the team in the ascendancy. There are definite similarities to last week’s opening day at Chelmsford when Yorkshire were bowled for 50 and Essex replied with 142 before tea. In the first two sessions of both first days, batting was extremely tricky before it looked completely different afterwards. Despite Ollie Pope’s impressive unbeaten 75, Rikki Clarke is the man who has changed the momentum of this game with a 65-ball fifty. He has moved to 66 out of 274-6. Not good news if you are a Haseeb Hameed fan. He has been caught behind off Luke Fletcher for nought. Lancashire still looking good at 87-2 in reply to Notts 133, mind you. At Lord’s, Eoin Morgan is unbeaten on 47 for Middlesex (289-3) against Gloucestershire, while Dawid Malan has 61. We are up and running after tea at the Oval, where Ollie Pope reached an important half-century before the break and, in his unbeaten 28, Rikki Clarke topped 10,000 first-class runs. Surrey are 214-6 as I type. Wickets have certainly tumbled at Trent Bridge and New Road. Notts all out for 133, although Lancashire are 73-0 in reply. Alex Davies is unbeaten on 46 with Haseeb Hameed to bat at three. Essex have been bowled out for 177, although Worcestershire have yet to start their reply. Early breakthrough for Northamptonshire as Doug Bracewell follows up his earlier feats with the bat to get Dom Sibley caught at third slip. Slight juggle from Brett Hutton but he held on falling to his right. The Bears are nought for one and this is proving a very quick match so far. A wicket at Edgbaston and a vital one for Warwickshire as skipper Jeetan Patel removes Steven Crook for an enterprising 92. It wasn’t exactly one for the highlights reel, with a ball spinning down leg nibbled behind: some sharp work by Tim Ambrose the stumps. Crook’s stand of 122 with Doug Bracewell equalled a record 8th wicket partnership for the visitors against the Bears. Northants are a much healthier looking 225 for eight now. Oh dear... Notts are all out for 133 at Trent Bridge, with Graham Onions and Tom Bailey finishing with three wickets apiece and Jimmy Anderson, back to a more natural colour of hair, two. It’s fair to say that the two meetings so far this season between Notts and Lancashire haven’t been ones for batsmen. Surrey, meanwhile, are 157-5. Ollie Pope has 36 of them. Steven Crook is playing a gem of an innings at Edgbaston in what is proving a fine partnership of 106 runs with Doug Bracewell to see Northants 208 for seven from 47 overs. Warwickshire have been on the attack, naturally, but so two have this pair, slapping 23 fours between them. Crook is unbeaten on 83 and Bracewell is on 54. Olly Stone started brightly but has struggled a bit after the break, with only the odd venomous delivery in between some loose stuff. Breakthrough for Yorkshire as Joe Root bowls Dean Elgar for 61, playing all round one and losing his leg stump. Surrey are 137-5 now with Ollie Pope their last recognised batsman unbeaten on 30. All happening at Trent Bridge. Two wickets for Jimmy Anderson and a Samit Patel run out. Notts are 122-7 against Lancashire. Alastair Cook has gone for 37 at New Road, driving at Joe Leach and edging to first slip. A angry swish at the turf follows. Essex are 68-3 against the Pears. Here, Surrey are 113-4 with Jonny Bairstow standing up to the stumps for Steve Patterson. Dean Elgar has 42 and Ollie Pope 19. Surrey head into lunch at 92-4, losing Ben Foakes 25 minutes before the break – caught behind off Steve Patterson, with a touch of out-swing enticing him into playing forwards defensively. He fell for 18. South African Dean Elgar is holding the innings together with an unbeaten 37, not something that will particularly please new national selector Ed Smith, who would have hoped for more success from the likes of Stoneman, Foakes and even Rory Burns. It is a similar story at Trent Bridge, where Nottinghamshire are 80-4 in the 30th against Lancashire. Graham Onions has three wickets, while Jordan Clark has just removed Jake Libby on the stroke of lunch. Haseeb Hameed is back in Lancashire’s team having been dropped against Somerset last week. Essex have reached 64-2 against Worcestershire at New Road, with Alastair Cook unbeaten on 34. In Division Two, there are healthy starts for Derbyshire against Durham (107-0), Kent against Sussex (97-2) and Middlesex against Gloucestershire (121-1). Nick Gubbins is unbeaten on 70 for the latter. Leicestershire are 62-5 against Glamorgan at Grace Road. No shortage of entertainment at Taunton on what is likely to be a shortened day. Hampshire are 111-3 at lunch. The two captains have caught the eye. James Vince always does and there were some silky drives, one lofted against Jack Leach, in his 43-ball 44, which included 10 boundaries. Less predictably Tom Abell, filling the fourth seamer role very effectively, has 2-18 from 7 overs. He has found late swing and the edge of Vince’s bat on a rare moment when the Hampshire captain was defending. Somerset have their two spinners playing but in four overs there was no sign of turn. The faster bowlers have been profligate, maybe feeling the pressure of the captain having inserted the opposition. They bowled with far less discipline than against Worcestershire and Yorkshire earlier in the season. This may be a used pitch (they defeated Yorkshire on it) but it still possesses some life for the quicker bowlers. Marcus Trescothick is alive and well. He hobbled up to the press area to do a little commentary on BBC radio. He will have an operation on Monday and is, of course, optimistic about an early return. (He’s thinking July, everyone else reckons August is more realistic). And there is a sighting of Jamie Overton bowling on the edge of the square. It has been a breathless morning at Edgbaston, where Northants go into the lunch break with a near run-a-minute 118 but for the loss of seven wickets. Little doubt as to who the start of the morning has been, with Henry Brookes, 18, picking up three and effecting a run out from long leg with a slingshot throw. Olly Stone has bowled with good heat on his comeback from injury and picked up two, nicking off Adam Rossington first ball and then ending a counter-attacking stand of 50 from Steven Crook and Josh Cobb when the latter slapped to point on 29. Crook is unbeaten on 43, having made use of the attacking fields, but this pitch is no minefield so there is a whole heap of work to be done after vittles. Early indications suggest it’s not the usual batting paradise here at the Oval, with Dean Elgar doing well to keep out a Steve Patterson delivery which kept low just now. Surrey have advanced to 60-3 in the 20th over. If Elgar, who has 27, and Ben Foakes (nine) can navigate the rest of the morning without further damage, that will be a good result for the home side. As Ali watches wickets tumble at Edgbaston, it’s a similar case at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 39-4 against Glamorgan, for whom Timm van der Gugten has a couple of wickets. After 45 frustrating minutes when Somerset bowled four no-balls and a few four balls, as well as dropping a regulation catch at second slip (“old Tresco would have caught that one”, but Matt Renshaw could not hold on), the home side has a wicket. Jimmy Adams was, as they say, adjudged caught behind off Tim Groenewald, and departed grumpily. Out came James Vince and to his second ball he played that shot and the ball flew at catchable height to third slip. There was no third slip. Since then he has played that shot more effectively and he’s raced to 27 in no time. Somerset are looking ragged and there may be a few old timers in the Colin Atkinson Pavilion shaking their heads – it’s the old players’ dinner tonight. Tom Abell, flushed by his success at Lancashire, is having a bowl, not a good sign for the home side. Hampshire are racing along at five over. Maybe that Ali Martin was right. Hang on. Abell just dismissed Weatherley for 28. Now it’s Abell against Amla. And Leach is having a bowl. 86-2 Wowsers. Olly Stone enters the attack and strikes first ball with a beauty to find the edge of Adam Rossington’s bat. Fast, nipped away, found the edge of a straight defensive shot off the back foot and Northants are 47 for five, with Henry Brookes have taken two earlier and pulled off a run out to boot. Warwickshire breathing fire right now. A couple of key wickets already for Yorkshire, who have got rid of Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns – one man who is fighting to hold onto his England opening berth and the other who has made a pretty strong case to pinch it. Stoneman was lbw playing forwards at Tim Bresnan for 10 and Burns caught at first slip off a Jack Brooks’ beauty for nine. Surrey are 23-2. Swing on offer and a bit of nibble. Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire are 17-1 against Lancashire at Trent Bridge, with Steven Mullaney falling against his former county, and Essex are 21-1 against Worcestershire at New Road. Varun Chopra was the man to depart. Alluding to Vic’s earlier post ... here’s a bit of pointless but fascinating trivia on the origins of Somerset Day. Cheese lovers take note: there’s an official twitter account and hampers of cheese seem to be available to win! Henry Brookes is making some impression here at Edgbaston, with two wickets in two overs to follow the initial breakthrough from Chris Wright and leave Northants in a state of disarray at 20 for three after six overs. Wright had Ben Duckett caught behind off an inside edge before Brookes bowled Alex Wakeley with a beauty. Just nipped away a touch and trimmed the off bail. The 18-year-old, whose action is effortlessly smooth, then had Richard Levi caught at slip to another leg-cutter, as Richie Benaud would say. Marvellous effort that. It is absolutely perishing here in Malahide. I’m not sure I’ve ever been any colder at a cricket ground. So I thought I’d chip in with an update just to get the blood flowing through my fingers. The weather’s actually better than it was this morning, or at least the light has improved. But it’s still spitting, so the covers are on. The umpires are making a cursory inspection as I write this. In terms of team news, Pakistan say they’re going to play the same side that turned out against Northants, which means Imam-ul-Haq will make his debut, and they’ve a long tail, with Shadab Khan batting at No7. We know most of Ireland’s side, but haven’t heard whether they are going to pick a spinner or not. In the meantime, the players are skulking in the pavilion, the groundstaff are scurrying around trying to keep everything dry, and the fans are huddled in the stands with their hoods up. Welcome to Test cricket, Ireland. Bit of a surprise here, as Yorkshire opt for an uncontested toss and elect to bowl first. As expected, Alex Lees has come into their team in place of Gary Ballance, while Josh Shaw has come in for the injured Ben Coad, who misses out with an ankle problem. Dean Elgar returns for Surrey in place of Ryan Patel following a commitment in South Africa which forced him out of the recent Worcestershire draw here. Jade Dernbach returns in place of Stuart Meaker. A collector’s item at Taunton. Hampshire obviously wanted to bat first (a used wicket is being used for this game) so insisted upon a toss, which was duly held. Somerset won the toss and promptly put Hampshire in. So the toss was unnecessary after all. Dom Bess, who was not in the squad announced on the eve of the game, is in the team so Somerset are playing two spinners. No Mason Crane for Hampshire yet and Liam Dawson is injured. The press box is filling up on “Somerset Day” and there is great anticipation after two home victories, wins that must have come as a bit of a surprise to my esteemed colleague at Edgbaston, who had Somerset relegated in his pre-season predictions. He may yet be proven right. But he’s not completely infallible (it’s Middle Chinnock). If he happens to be wrong, I may remind him come September. Sadly they predict rain sometime in the afternoon, but the forecast not too bad thereafter. We have had a toss at Edgbaston and Northants are batting with the sun breaking through the haze. Olly Stone has indeed got the nod against his old club, so looking forward to seeing him steam in and a look at young Henry Brookes too. Highly thought of. Good morning from the Oval, where we have news. Joe Root will be captaining Yorkshire this weekend following the late withdrawal of regular captain Gary Ballance through illness. Ballance was feeling unwell and did not train with his White Rose team-mates when they arrived in London yesterday afternoon. He was assessed last night and sent home to Leeds. This will be Root’s fourth match in charge of Yorkshire in the County Championship, with the other three all coming in their title-winning season of 2014. His first was that record chase by Middlesex at Lord’s when Chris Rogers hit a double century in pursuit of 472, with him earning the nickname ‘craptain’ from his England team-mates. He then lifted the title at Nottinghamshire later in the season and skippered against Somerset, with Andrew Gale banned following a verbal altercation with Ashwell Prince in a Roses match. Alex Lees has replaced Ballance in Yorkshire’s squad and will likely open the batting. Surrey come into this match with a win and two draws from their first three matches, while Yorkshire have won two and drawn two. County cricket live is back, for what is the fifth round of matches and the last before the season switches to 50-over cricket for a spell. It’s also the final audition for any England hopefuls before Ed Smith sits down with Trevor Bayliss and Joe Root next Tuesday to pick their Test squad to face Pakistan, if national team #narrative is your thing. Anyway, greetings from a fresh and dry Edgbaston where Division Two pace-setters Warwickshire host Northamptonshire – a team they brushed aside by an innings and 48 runs at Wantage Road just three weeks ago. Be interesting to see if ex-Steelback Olly Stone, one of those hoping to catch Smith’s eye, gets a run out. The talk is it may be too soon after a hamstring twang. We’ll see. Vic Marks, meanwhile, is at Taunton. Social media tells me it’s Somerset Day today, so expect East Chinnock’s finest to take us on a stirring journey from Wookey Hole to the as-yet-constructed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station while he watches Tom Abell’s second-placed side take on Hampshire. My dud prediction of seventh for his old team will probably get an airing too. Groan. Elsewhere in Division One the battle of the blonds take place at Trent Bridge, where table-topping Nottinghamshire host Lancashire (champions-elect as per another shrewd call by yours truly) in a match that pits Stuart Broad against the peroxide pilferer Jimmy Anderson. Both were resting when the two teams met at Old Trafford in the first round and Notts gloriously romped to their fourth innings target of 10 just four wickets down. Graham Hardcastle is also on duty at the Oval, where Yorkshire take on Surrey after their epic win over Essex in the last round, while lowly Worcestershire host the champions at New Road. In Division Two, Mark Wood is back for Durham after being released early by Chennai Superkings and will be in the XI that takes on Derbyshire away, Jason Gillespie’s Sussex, as they are seemingly now known, are at south coast neighbours Kent, Leicestershire host Glamorgan and Middlesex, perhaps featuring Steven Finn and Eoin Morgan for the first time this season, play Gloucestershire at Lord’s. If Morgan plays it will end a near three-year first-class hiatus. Have a great day, all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/nov/01/britain-theresa-may-build-unstable-trident-heathrow-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-01T10:36:10Z","webTitle":"The Britain that Theresa May is trying to build has unstable foundations | Caroline Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/britain-theresa-may-build-unstable-trident-heathrow-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/01/britain-theresa-may-build-unstable-trident-heathrow-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"The Britain that Theresa May is trying to build has unstable foundations","bodyText":"Prime ministers like to build big things. They like to wear high-visibility jackets and watch concrete being poured. They like to cut ribbons. And they like a legacy. Theresa May is different from past prime ministers in many ways, but it seems she shares with her predecessors a penchant for big projects, even in the face of overwhelming evidence against them. In just a few months she has pushed a vote to renew Trident, given the go-ahead to Hinkley Point C and pledged her government’s support for the expansion of Britain’s busiest airport. Taken separately these decisions are big. Together they tell us about the kind of Britain this government is trying to build, literally as well as metaphorically: a country ill-equipped for the future and that won’t meet its own needs; a nation whose presence on the world stage will be defined by its ability to kill millions; a Britain failing to make the economic transition necessary to free itself from the worst effects of climate change. Communities that get the illusion of control, provided they make the decisions people in power want. The choices we’re offered say just as much about the Westminster’s mindset as the final outcomes. Do we want Heathrow or Gatwick? Nuclear power or gas? Safety provided by nuclear weapons or the danger of losing them? We weren’t offered no new runways or a truly decentralised, community-owned energy system. The government didn’t ask whether we want the security of not transporting nuclear weapons across our country. And, without a coherent official opposition on these issues, genuine debate about these alternatives is dangerously narrowed. It’s striking that support for these mega-projects hasn’t only come from the Conservatives and their friends in big business. The Labour party and the trade unions are backing them, too. An old-school consensus has emerged which sees everyone from Unite to the CBI competing over who can shout loudest about the benefits of building big things. Never mind the better choices buried in the process. But the truth is we do not live in an economy with only binary options. The government could have chosen not to support Heathrow – and instead followed the climate science to its logical conclusion and pledged action to tackle the surging demand for flying from the super rich. They know that 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of people – and that a simple tax on frequent flights could eliminate the need for new runways – but such evidence gets in the way of their love for laying tarmac. They talk of giving people back control: well try telling that to the people of Harmondsworth in west London – whose homes are set to be the collateral from this environmentally disastrous plan. The plan to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point is equally reckless. Bill payers will stump up billions for this colossal folly – and precious resources will be diverted away from building an energy system suited to this century. But of all of the mega-projects, it is the renewal of Trident that is potentially the most catastrophic. The arguments against Trident are well-rehearsed. But the very fact that building a new generation of weapons of mass destruction is pitched by politicians as central to our nationhood should give us pause for thought. What makes Britain need nukes so desperately when almost all other countries on earth maintain their safety without them? The Labour party’s position on Trident is particularly strange. It has stated that it is in favour of renewal – but the party has a leader who, quite rightly, says he would never fire the missiles if he became prime minister. Both positions have logic to them, but combined in one party and the end point is committing to building a nuclear weapons system based on the (flawed) theory of deterrence but with a cast-iron guarantee that the those submarines will do nothing more than float aimlessly around the ocean, in a constant state of readiness to do nothing. Perhaps one of the new vessels could be called HMS Pointless? Of course, if we scrap Trident we need to guarantee the jobs and economic security of those working at Faslane, Aldermaston and elsewhere. A “defence diversification agency” would help to ensure a just transition for the people whose jobs are directly dependent on Trident. It’s not just alternatives to Trident that are desperately needed. Instead of Hinkley, let’s lead the world in energy conservation. Imagine, for example, that home insulation was central to the government’s infrastructure plans. A nationwide scheme to keep people warm, cut fuel bills and tackle carbon emissions would create more than 100,000 jobs across the UK. Or imagine we redoubled our efforts to lead the world in renewables and energy storage technologies. That would create more jobs than nuclear weapons or power ever will. We know that green energy creates far more jobs per gigawatt and that every community in Britain can create its own power. Our energy system doesn’t have to be centralised, or owned by multinational firms and foreign governments. It can be built in Britain, located in every community and it can be beautiful. Infrastructure isn’t just about concrete and hard economic growth. It’s about social connections, too. The qualitative growth that could come from a community learning new skills to manage and run renewable energy projects they own. The conversations over fences, in the post office and pub. It’s the ties that bind us – and the networks that make us a whole greater than the sum of our parts. Indeed, I would argue that our biggest pieces of infrastructure aren’t bridges, or buildings – they’re the welfare state upon which we all rely, and our National Health Service. So when the government tells you it’s investing in infrastructure, and then ministers don hard hats at opening ceremonies, remember what they’re demolishing with one hand as they cut ribbons with the other. My challenge to both the government and the official opposition is simple: take a step back and think carefully about the kind of Britain we want to build. We’re a small country, but we should be big in ambition. Let’s pause for a moment before we pour more tarmac for more planes to land on, build obscenely expensive power plants or forge our path in the wake of submarines carrying weapons of mass destruction. This is a fork in the road – and we have a chance to build an economy that not only meets the challenges of the 21st century head-on but creates a better country in the process. Let’s not miss this opportunity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2017/may/13/do-state-institutions-resources-fight-hackers-public-sector-ransomware","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-13T19:09:23Z","webTitle":"Do state institutions have the resources to fight hackers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/13/do-state-institutions-resources-fight-hackers-public-sector-ransomware","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/may/13/do-state-institutions-resources-fight-hackers-public-sector-ransomware","fields":{"headline":"Do state institutions have the resources to fight hackers?","bodyText":"Last October the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust was subject to a cyber-attack that saw it forced to shut down its IT systems, resulting in the cancellation of almost 3,000 patient appointments. Until last Friday the incident was one of the few known examples of an attack on the NHS using ransomware, a type of software that encrypts a computer system’s files and refuses to unlock them until a payment is made. Once an obscure form of computer hacking, ransomware attacks are now ubiquitous. More than 600 million such attacks were carried out last year alone. Those demanding the ransoms often insist on being paid in bitcoins – the virtual currency that allows its owners to hide their identity. But what was unusual about Friday’s attack was its reach – 99 countries were hit. High-profile victims include French car manufacturer Renault, Germany’s rail service Deutsche Bahn and Spain’s Telefonica. Almost three-quarters of the victims were in Russia. In the UK, 48 NHS trusts and scores more GP practices were affected. Many others closed their IT systems down as a precautionary measure. As the crisis escalated yesterday into a full-blooded election issue, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, promised that “lessons would be learned” from what experts describe as one of the biggest cyber-attacks since the infamous Love Bug virus in May 2000 which largely infected personal computers rather than critical, corporate IT systems. But many experts believes lessons should have been learned long ago. “It’s not as though this has come as a shock to anybody,” said Paul Vlissidis, technical director at NCC Group, a cybersecurity firm. “For anyone who works in the NHS or the security industry, a lot of people have been saying for a long time that there’s going to be a big one that gets through.” Of the 29 NHS trusts that answered a freedom of information request from NCC, 28 revealed that they had been a victim of ransomware in 2016. Papworth heart and lung hospital in Cambridgeshire was subject to one such attack, according to its ICT director, Jane Berezynskyj, who told a conference last year the malware had started encrypting the hospital’s files just after its daily backup had been completed. “We were very, very lucky,” she acknowledged. NHS trusts have been warned to back up their computer systems regularly but it is unclear how many follow the guidance. NHS staff have told the Observer that hospital IT teams were scrambling to fix their systems several weeks ago – ever since Microsoft alerted the world to the vulnerability of its operating system back in March. The system’s vulnerability was exploited by a hacking collective called Shadow Brokers which released a hacking tool – thought to have been developed by the US military security organisation, the National Security Agency – on to the internet, allowing others to launch ransomware attack weeks later. By yesterday afternoon it was estimated that around 120,000 systems around the world were infected. It is common practice for security agencies like the NSA to develop tools to exploit computer systems. But these tools can then end up being acquired by criminal gangs and state actors, according to experts. “It’s our governments, via the intelligence agencies, that share a responsibility for creating vulnerabilities in our communication networks, surveilling our smart phones and televisions and exploiting loopholes in our operating systems,” said Dr Simon Moores, chair of the International eCrime Congress. One theory suggests an NSA contractor left the hacking tools on an unsecured computer from where they were stolen by the Shadowbrokers collective, about whom little is known. “They are very good hackers with experience in operational security,” said Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team. “You see it in all the choices they make,” Raiu added, pointing out that they used specialist encryption tools and hardware to protect their identities. “They’re not amateurs, they’re very highly skilled which makes it very hard to catch them.” But even if they were apprehended others would take their place. According to Moores, malware programs are sold on darknet markets “for the price of a good curry”. This is a concern for the managers of archaic NHS IT systems. “The problem is that the old IT systems were never designed to withstand the forces now ranged against them,” Moores said. “You may note that US hospitals haven’t been so badly hurt if only because they have the money to use more up-to-date systems rather than coax older systems to keep going.” Cash-strapped NHS hospitals have been reluctant to spend money to upgrade their IT systems. Those in special measures complain that they have been prevented from allocating resources to tackle the problem. As a result, many NHS IT systems have been cobbled together down the years by piling new software on old software, creating an unwieldy and complex infrastructure that is not fit for purpose. An article in the British Medical Journal noted: “Many hospitals use proprietary software that runs on ancient operating systems. Barts Health NHS Trust’s computers, attacked by ransomware in January, ran Windows XP. Released in 2001, it is now obsolete, yet 90% of NHS trusts run this version of Windows.” Overhauling these systems requires skilled IT professionals. But a report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee noted in February that “the government faces a real struggle to find enough public sector employees with the skills to match the pace of change”. Until that skills gap is closed, the UK’s public sector will always be one step behind the hackers, a concern for security experts who question whether other critical IT systems such as those in the nuclear power and energy transmission sectors may be equally vulnerable. Raiu predicted that Friday’s attack would force governments to take action against crypto-currencies. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in the near future governments ban the use of bitcoins.” Kaspersky Lab’s analysis suggested that as of yesterday afternoon only around 60 people had paid the $300 bitcoin ransom demanded to unlock their computers. He suggested that the number would grow in the coming days as companies and individuals researched how to purchase bitcoins. “We don’t recommend that you pay the ransom,” Raui said. “Make a backup and maybe a solution to decrypt the data will become available in the near future.” The one crumb of comfort from the chaos unleashed on the world’s IT systems is that it could have been worse. The ransomware’s global spread was embedded with a “kill switch”. This compelled the ransomware to search the web for an address that, having been found and activated, stopped it from spreading. Fortunately for the world’s systems, a UK security expert stumbled across the address and activated it. It suggests the hackers had appreciated the attack’s devastating potential and gave themselves an insurance policy to bring the hack to an end. Their successors may not be so risk averse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jun/11/if-hard-brexit-dead-odds-on-chaotic-one-shortened","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-11T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"If hard Brexit is dead, the odds on a chaotic one have shortened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/if-hard-brexit-dead-odds-on-chaotic-one-shortened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jun/11/if-hard-brexit-dead-odds-on-chaotic-one-shortened","fields":{"headline":"If hard Brexit is dead, the odds on a chaotic one have shortened","bodyText":"Investors’ ability to take a rosy view of an even deeper Brexit mess is remarkable. Sterling, the market’s usual prism for viewing the UK’s departure from the European Union, fell 2% on Friday but the pound is still higher than it was on the morning of 18 April, the day Theresa May announced her fateful plan to go to the country to secure a stronger negotiating hand. Investors’ mood of semi-cheerfulness flows from the idea that May is now so weakened that she, or the next Tory leader, won’t be able to pursue a hard Brexit that seeks to take the UK out of the EU single market and customs union. A market-friendly plotline – a soft form of Brexit that secures cross-party support – is indeed possible. But before investors run away with the idea that the Brexit landscape has been transformed, they should consider the alternative. The original fault lines may simply have widened. A safe passage out of the EU may have become trickier to find. The immediate problem is that the negotiating clock is now ticking. May’s biggest mistake – bigger than the botched manifesto, the U-turns and her arrogantly aloof approach to campaigning – was to trigger article 50 before calling the general election. If she felt she needed a personal negotiating mandate, she should have secured popular backing for her version of Brexit and only then embarked on the process. As it is, the UK is now saddled with a minority government that must revisit basic Brexit questions. The Democratic Unionist party says it does not want a hard Brexit, which presumably implies staying in the customs union at least. So how will May hope to keep the Eurosceptic hardliners in her own party happy? The argy-bargy could take weeks, or months, to address, and may only lead to May’s resignation or another election. Whatever Westminster dance follows, the EU27 are not obliged to grant the UK a time-out. Why would they? Their negotiating power is growing by the day. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, grasped the point: “We do not know when Brexit talks start,” he said. “We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a ‘no deal’ as result of ‘no negotiations’.” Well, quite. The two-year deadline for negotiating departure from the EU was tight in the first place. It starts to look daunting if the UK spends the first six months forming an unstable government that then collapses and then holds a second general election that produces another wobbly administration. Those would be perfect conditions for the UK crashing out of the EU in 2019 without a deal – not from choice, but because we couldn’t get our act together. The deeper problem, of course, is that 48% of the country voted Remain last year and the victorious 52% of Leavers never agreed on what form of Brexit they wanted. David Page, senior economist at Axa Investment Managers, puts it this way: “The difficulty for any government would be that there is no Brexit consensus to deliver: supporters were drawn to Brexit for diverse (and sometimes diametrically opposed) reasons. The problem for this government is that its new fragility increases the difficulty in driving through its version of Brexit, raising the chances of a chaotic Brexit with no deal in place.” In the immediate aftermath of the election, one can understand why investors were still sanguine. The trade incentives for both the EU27 and the UK are intact. Common sense could yet prevail and soft Brexit could be the result. It’s too soon to panic. Yet the chances of panic further down the line – either in the form of a plunge in sterling or a wobble in the gilts market – have surely increased. In other circumstances, one might say a cry of alarm from financial markets is exactly what’s required – it might help to force consensus. In the case of Brexit, however, it’s hard to be hopeful it would he heard. The UK has just held a “Brexit election” in which neither main party wanted to talk in detail about Brexit. Renewables and nuclear are the way out of future crises in Qatar One former energy minister warned a few years ago that if there was chaos in Qatar, the tiny gulf state that supplies a third of the UK’s gas imports, then the UK would be “up shit creek”. Reality has not proved so apocalyptic. Despite the diplomatic crisis facing Doha last week, the country’s vast shipments of frozen gas to Britain are unlikely to be affected – although transport costs may rise modestly. But what if the crisis was to escalate? And what about in two decades’ time, when an exhausted North Sea leaves the UK importing as much as 93% of its gas, rather than the 60% of today? On the face of it, such a prospect sounds alarming. However, Britain increasingly relies on imports for many things. Few people stay awake at night fretting over the 40% of our food that is imported. Similarly, few would have even noticed the UK flipping from a net exporter of gas before 2004 to an importer now. The reality is there is plenty of gas out there in the world, and it can come from increasingly far-flung places. That was illustrated last week by the arrival of a US tanker packed with liquefied natural gas in Świnoujście, a Polish port. It was the first US shipment of LNG to central Europe, and the US’s fast-growing position as an energy powerhouse suggests this is a sign of the future, rather than an aberration. Nor is there a lack of infrastructure in the UK. There are three LNG terminals in the UK to bring the stuff in, as well as four gas pipelines to Europe. As one expert told the Observer, when it comes to infrastructure for gas imports, “we are pretty well endowed”. There are alternatives to increasing dependence. One is to frack for shale gas – but there are huge unknowns about whether Britain’s geology will make it economically viable to extract it, and about its political acceptability. The other is to focus on renewable and nuclear power, and storage and energy efficiency, to displace the need for gas to generate electricity and heat Britain’s homes. That is surely the best long-term solution. Directors just love a large slice of rich Burberry pie Calculating executive pay is fiendishly difficult, which is why Vince Cable, when he was business secretary, required companies to publish a “single figure” for how much their boardroom directors received each year. It is not a perfect solution, but the figures are intended to make it easier to compare pay changes over the years and between different companies. Largely, it works. But the publication of Burberry’s annual report last week also shows it doesn’t pick up all pay awards. The “single figure” for Christopher Bailey – the company’s design guru who next month will hand over day-to-day management to a new chief executive – puts his total for 2017 at £3.5m. Leaf on a few pages, and it turns out Bailey is also being handed 600,000 shares – worth a cool £10.5m. A tiny footnote explains these shares are not included in the “single figure” as they “were awarded to Christopher prior to his appointment to the board and are not subject to performance”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/sep/21/nuclear-plant-project-osbornes-commits-2bn-guarantee","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-20T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: Osborne seeks to ease doubts with £2bn guarantee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/21/nuclear-plant-project-osbornes-commits-2bn-guarantee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/sep/21/nuclear-plant-project-osbornes-commits-2bn-guarantee","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: Osborne seeks to ease doubts with £2bn guarantee","bodyText":"George Osborne has vowed to confront anxieties over Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear energy sector after announcing a £2bn government guarantee for the delayed and controversial Hinkley Point power plant project in Somerset. Speaking in Beijing on the second day of his five-day tour of China, the chancellor said the project in south-west England was “a win-win-win for the UK and … a great example of how the relationship with China has a direct material benefit to the people living in our country”. “I think we have to confront any anxieties that exist out there about Chinese investment in British civil nuclear power,” Osborne told a press conference in Beijing. The initial backing from the British government would pave the way for the construction of Britain’s first new nuclear power station for a generation, Osborne said, as he redoubled his arguments for nuclear in the face of opposition from environmental groups.Addressing concerns over Chinese involvement, Osborne said: “The truth is this: the reactor – which is actually a French reactor – can only go ahead if it is signed off by our nuclear safety experts and there are plenty of rules that exist to protect the British people from the misuse of civil nuclear power and to make sure that our nuclear power stations are completely safe. “For me personally, it is a tragedy that for two decades we gave up on building these nuclear power stations. This government is determined to get back into building nuclear power stations. We are going to secure reliable low-carbon energy for the future. But instead of me committing tens of billions of pounds of British taxpayers’ money to these nuclear power stations – which is money I would otherwise be able to spend on the health service or the education system or indeed give lower taxes to people – instead of that we have created a model where we can attract Chinese investment into civil nuclear power.” Osborne said Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point “opens the door for majority Chinese ownership of a subsequently nuclear project in Bradwell.” London and Beijing had also agreed to set up a “cutting-edge” £50m nuclear research centre, the chancellor announced. The Hinkley plans have been beset by problems and the plant’s developer, EDF, the French energy group, recently admitted it may be further delayed. Amid concerns over when Chinese backers will commit investment to the plan, the project has come under intensifying criticism from the energy industry and the City. Analysts have questioned the economics of a project that, at £24.5bn, could cost as much as the combined bill for Crossrail, the London 2012 Olympics and the revamped Terminal 2 at Heathrow. But there has been no sign of the government wavering in its commitment. EDF has already won a generous financial aid package from the government through its “contract for difference” mechanism but has yet to sign the definitive deal it needs with Beijing investors. The Treasury said Osborne’s announcement of an initial government guarantee for the project would smooth the path to a final investment decision by EDF, supported by China General Nuclear corporation and China National Nuclear corporation. A breakthrough is expected when the Chinese premier visits the UK next month, leaving EDF in a position to finally give the green light to the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK for 20 years. The government hopes the construction and operation of Hinkley Point C will create thousands of jobs in Somerset and more widely in the nuclear industry across the UK, as well as boosting Britain’s energy security. The new plant is expected to produce enough energy to supply 7% of the country’s needs, powering around 6m homes, the Treasury said. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said Osborne’s approval of an infrastructure guarantee was a “clear sign” of the government’s commitment to Hinkley Point C. “It is further progress towards a final investment decision on a project which will provide reliable, affordable low-carbon electricity for decades,” he added. Last week, three leading environmentalists who broke ranks to give their support to a new generation of nuclear plants joined together to urge the government to scrap plans for Hinkley Point C. George Monbiot, Mark Lynas and Chris Goodall said the soaring cost of, and delays to, the Hinkley project left ministers with no option but to pour the estimated £24.5bn-worth of investment into other low-carbon technologies. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said: “This announcement is a PR smokescreen to give the impression that this project is moving forward when it’s actually bogged down in a swamp of troubles. Hinkley hasn’t got funding or safety clearance, and everyone outside the nuclear industry and our blinkered government thinks it’s absurd, yet the chancellor is ignoring them all to plough ahead with this overpriced, overrated and overtime project.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-byelection-results-a-test-for-mr-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T19:05:58Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the byelection results: a test for Mr Corbyn | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-byelection-results-a-test-for-mr-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-byelection-results-a-test-for-mr-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the byelection results: a test for Mr Corbyn","bodyText":"What happens when you know all about an impending catastrophe but somehow cannot take it seriously? Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of finding out. It cannot be much cheer that the opposition won just one out of two seats it has held for more than half a century. Last night’s capture of Copeland for the Conservatives is a big political event by any measure. Copeland – and its predecessor seat – had been Labour since 1935. It was the first time a governing party had won a byelection from the main opposition party since 1982. It is an exceptional result for Theresa May and a humbling one for Mr Corbyn. Some of that is down to local factors, in particular the Labour leader’s dislike of the nuclear power industry on which west Cumbria is so economically dependent. It is worth recalling that even when Labour ran on a more visceral anti-nuclear manifesto in 1983, voters in Copeland backed the party. The region is one of many in which traditional Labour voters still balk at switching to the Tories, but when so many jobs are at stake it can happen. Copeland is also a whiter, wealthier constituency than average – and also importantly one with a larger manufacturing base than that usually found. It is the sort of seat that Labour needs to keep hold of in the north. The Tory win underlines Mrs May’s and the Tories’ growing ascendancy. It also hints at the larger potential of Mrs May’s conservatism to capture the centre ground of English politics – though she will have to persuade her party too. Parliamentary byelections always tell an important story, but care is needed in putting those stories into a national context. Labour held on in Stoke Central, a contest in which many initially wrote them off. The Liberal Democrats’ recent surge was not repeated either. In some ways the biggest loser this week was Ukip. When the two byelections were triggered, many assumed that the two seats, Stoke in particular, might be Ukip’s for the taking. Perhaps they might have been if the view that Brexit has revolutionised everything had been right. But it wasn’t. Ukip’s arrogance, divisions and obsessions were not what the voters turned out to want. Paul Nuttall, the party leader, staked his future on winning in Stoke. His flaws were ruthlessly exposed, in the press and on the stump. His future must therefore be in doubt. Another round of the Ukip leadership soap opera may beckon. Ukip is not dead. But claims that it is poised to sweep Labour aside have underestimated the good sense of the voters. Yet the byelection results support a second important conclusion as well. They seriously undermine the lazy assumption, peddled especially by some of the rightwing press but swallowed also by some in the Labour party, that the Brexit referendum has redefined British party politics at a stroke. Both of these constituencies were very clear Brexit supporters in 2016. Yet their votes for Brexit did not give the byelections a new shape. Instead their shape is recognisably an old one. In Stoke, the shifts in party share of the vote between 2015 and 2017 were small. Even in Copeland, they were modest. These byelections look more like traditional contests between England’s four main parties (five if you count the Greens) than local reruns of the Brexit argument. They were arguably at least as much about May v Corbyn as about Britain and the EU. This is not good for Mr Corbyn. The Tories have, according to our latest poll, an 18-point lead over Labour. Labour MPs and trade unionists are right to fret about the party’s prospects. It is a concern that Mr Corbyn refuses to shift tack from campaigning on issues such as the NHS and social housing which failed to energise voters. Politicians are often blinkered, inclined to see what they want to see and have supreme confidence in their own abilities. However, unwarranted optimism must evaporate when confronted by hard truths. Labour should have retained both seats with ease if it was an effective opposition. In some of the earlier byelections in this parliament – such as Oldham West, Sheffield Brightside and Tooting – Labour did quite respectably. But not this week. There is nothing here for Labour to celebrate. The 2015 election was already a low base, from which Labour has once again declined. These results point to the continuing erosion of the Labour party as a credible governing party in modern Britain under Mr Corbyn. Maybe this is not terminal decline, but that is hardly a consolation for Labour wellwishers. Yes, Labour survives. But to what end? What is today’s Labour party for? This is a question which needs a better answer than Mr Corbyn is offering. • This article was amended on 27 February 2017. An earlier version said the Conservative’s victory in Copeland was the first time a sitting government had won a byelection since 1982. It was the first time a governing party had won a byelection from the main opposition party in that time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/oct/08/power-struggles-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T21:53:50Z","webTitle":"Power struggles over the Hinkley Point nuclear power station | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/oct/08/power-struggles-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/oct/08/power-struggles-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"Power struggles over the Hinkley Point nuclear power station","bodyText":"‘This decision shows the European Commission agrees that this is a good deal for consumers,” claimed Ed Davey, energy and climate change secretary, as the Hinkley Point nuclear power station got the go-ahead in Brussels. For breath-taking cheek, that statement takes some beating. The commission, after a sceptical interim report, only approved Hinkley Point after it said it had knocked chunks off the bill on behalf of UK taxpayers by insisting on tougher “gain-share” conditions, whereby a small portion of EDF’s projected huge profits will be recouped in later years. Instead of slapping itself on the back, the government should explain why it wasn’t able to achieve those savings under its own steam during its long negotiations with EDF, the French state-backed firm that will build and operate the plant. Davey should also note that the commission did not suggest Hinkley Point is “a good deal for consumers”. Instead, it accepted that the project does not breach state-aid rules because the UK had shown there was “a genuine market failure”. That is very different from Davey’s spin that UK consumers have somehow got lucky. Indeed, who could possibly describe Hinkley Point as good value? The UK will still be paying £92.50 per megawatt hour, which is roughly twice the current wholesale price of power. What’s more, the payments to EDF will rise with inflation for 35 years. The project only makes financial sense if the cost of energy produced from fossil fuels soars in future years and if renewable sources fail to become cheaper. Maybe life will turn out that way. But, on day one, UK consumers are out-and-out losers from this deal: the cost of increased energy security via nuclear power is higher bills. What Davey should have said is this: “The EC has agreed the UK has the right to pay massive subsidies for nuclear power because its energy policy has been a shambles for 30 years.” ScotRail goes Dutch The loss of three rail franchises in quick succession looks like a trend. FirstGroup has lost Capital Connect, the Caledonian Sleeper and now ScotRail. They all hurt, but the latest will inflict the biggest blow to corporate pride in Aberdeen. As things stand, the only FirstGroup trains that will run on Scottish tracks from next April will be those that creep across the border on its TransPennine Express service. Chief executive Tim O’Toole struggled to explain the ScotRail shock. His stock exchange announcement was an extended boast about the wonders of the service for 10 years under FirstGroup and the gongs that have been accumulated (“Rail Operator of the Year” – and won only last week, don’t you know?). The only part left unsaid – though not by Scottish Labour politicians and unions – was the oddness of a Scottish Nationalist government handing ScotRail to a Dutch group, Abellio. The only consolation for FirstGroup is that loss of ScotRail is not seriously damaging, profits-wise. Some £13m was on the cards. That will be forgotten if the company can land the East Coast franchise, due to be announced next month. If it can’t, it’s back to hoping that school buses and Greyhound coaches in the US can re-invigorate a corporate turnaround plan that, like the share price, is currently going backwards. Tesco’s cash call A rights issue “would be an astute strategic move by Tesco provided it acts swiftly and before its competitors”, thinks HSBC analyst David McCarthy. He has been bearish and correct about Tesco for ages so his views are worth following. That’s especially so when he is turning “neutral” on the stock on the basis that a lot of the bad news is already reflected in a share price that has halved in a year. But does Tesco need a rights issue? Yes, it probably does. As McCarthy points out, on most standard measures of balance-sheet strength, Tesco has strayed miles from targets set only a year ago. That’s what happens when top-line profits fall steeply at a business with fixed costs, such as rents. Fresh cash – £3bn minimum – would remove investors’ concerns about the balance sheet, McCarthy argues. It would also relieve the pressure to flog assets and give new chief executive Dave Lewis freedom to clear the decks and take the fight to the opposition. But note that detail about launching any rights issue swiftly. Actually, Mike Coupe at Sainsbury’s, in the midst of his own strategic review, is the one who should take note. If Sainsbury’s is also contemplating a cash call on shareholders, it probably doesn’t want to be second in the queue after a financially-reinforced Tesco."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-power-station-makes-no-sense-on-so-many-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T18:47:50Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point power station makes no sense on so many levels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-power-station-makes-no-sense-on-so-many-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-power-station-makes-no-sense-on-so-many-levels","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point power station makes no sense on so many levels","bodyText":"In a rational world, the concerns of the UK intelligence agencies would kill the idea of Chinese state involvement in our nuclear power stations. Here, we will stick to a financial appraisal of Hinkley Point. The answer is the same: the project makes no sense. After 30 years of stop-start policymaking in Westminster, energy generation involves necessary compromises between three competing goals – cleanliness, cost and reliability. Hinkley will achieve one of those ambitions – nuclear is clean in the sense that it produces little carbon – but it fails the other two tests by absurdly wide margins. First, cost. The latest £18bn figure is lower than previously advertised and developer EDF and its Chinese co-travellers can boast that consumers won’t pay a penny until electricity is produced. But, once the reactors are running, we’ll pay through the nose. The price for Hinkley’s output is £92.50 per megawatt hour in 2012 money – twice the current market rate – and will rise with inflation for 35 years. The terms are attractive only if you believe the price of oil will return to about $150 a barrel and stay there; almost nobody thinks that. How about reliability? This, supposedly, is Hinkley’s trump card. The UK needs a secure base load of energy, runs the argument, for days when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. Further, we can’t rely too heavily on imported gas. But look at the record of EDF’s European pressurised reactor (EPR) design, the model to be built at Hinkley. Similar plants are nine years behind schedule in Finland and six years late on EDF’s home patch in Normandy. The moral should be simple: if you want secure supplies by a given date because you need to avoid a capacity crunch, don’t order an EPR. The latest estimate for Hinkley’s arrival is 2025. Believe it when you see it – the contract allows delivery any time before 2033. By then, the frontline political careers of David Cameron and George Osborne will be over. They will not be around to explain to consumers why Hinkley seemed a good idea at the time. Electra boss right to be angry about backdoor bid for control “Ill-judged, ill-informed and ill-founded.” This is not usually how chairmen of investment trusts talk about claims made by their largest shareholder. But Roger Yates at Electra Private Equity is right to be angry about the antics of Edward Bramson, the activist investor from Sherborne who wants a couple of seats on the board. Bramson is a frustrating fellow. He seems to think he has a formula for improving Electra, but he refuses to say what it is. In last year’s battle, which he lost, he claimed more than £1bn of value could be released from Electra’s portfolio of investments but offered no evidence as to how. In the current confrontation, which will end with a vote on 5 November, he has dropped his eye-catching figures but his analysis of Electra’s alleged shortcomings remains thin. The reality is that Electra does roughly what it is supposed to: it aims to generate a return on equity of 10%-15% a year and has achieved 13% on average over the past decade. Costs, one suspects, could be lower, but Electra is not out of line with its industry. There are many better targets for a dose of activist agitation. Bramson’s true ambition, Electra’s board thinks, is to gain control by the backdoor. It is probably right there, too. In the circumstances, there is no point seeking compromise. Instead, Yates is appealing for support from other shareholders. It worked last year, but Bramson now controls 29.75%, rather than 20%. He will still need others’ votes, which in practice means fund managers Fidelity, Aviva and Insight since all have stakes in both Electra and Sherborne. None of the trio would comment on its intentions on Wednesday, which is par for the course in this saga. Get off the fence, chaps: if your boasts about being responsible stewards of other people’s money mean anything, Bramson should not be your man in this quarrel. Is Pearson’s short pain turning into a chronic ache? “We are in the middle of what we believe will be a short but difficult transition,” said John Fallon, chief executive of Pearson, in February 2014, unveiling a restructuring plan to keep pace with the digital revolution in school and college textbooks in the US. For a while, a prediction of brief pain followed by recovery seemed accurate. The share price had rebounded from £10 to £15 by spring this year. Now it’s back at a tenner after a nasty profit warning. Trading conditions have “yet to improve”, says Fallon. A short transition is stretching into the middle distance. Fallon says Pearson is gaining share in markets that are shrinking, and that earnings haven’t been helped by the strength of the pound and disposals, such as the FT. OK, but the net result is that earnings per share for 2015 will now arrive at the bottom end of a revised 70p-75p range. Six months ago, investors were hoping Pearson would return to 80p, a figure last achieved in 2012. If 70p is the new normal, shareholders will worry that the next surprise could be a transition to a lower dividend. Last year’s payment was 51p, which leaves little room for more setbacks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/dec/19/uk-energy-auction-coal-nuclear-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-19T10:04:08Z","webTitle":"£1bn subsidy in energy capacity auction will boost coal and nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/19/uk-energy-auction-coal-nuclear-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/dec/19/uk-energy-auction-coal-nuclear-generation","fields":{"headline":"£1bn subsidy in energy capacity auction will boost coal and nuclear power","bodyText":"Consumers will need to stump an extra £1bn a year in 2018 to encourage power stations to stay open and keep the lights on, the government confirmed on Friday. A “capacity market” auction undertaken this week by National Grid has ended with a price of £19.40 per kilowatt (kW) being agreed as a subsidy. EDF, the owner of the UK’s existing nuclear fleet, is one of the major provisional winners but other “big six” firms such as E.ON, npower and SSE have also succeeded. The government wanted 48.6GW of power to be guaranteed to be available during 2018. It expected to encourage new gas-fired power stations to be built under new 15-year contracts. In fact 68% of the capacity is to be provided by existing power stations and only 5% by new build. More controversially nearly 19% of the power will come from either coal or biomass. The decision to allow coal plants to bid in the auction has been highly controversial because it potentially extends the life of heavy carbon-producing generation which is bad for global warming. But EDF’s nuclear fleet is also providing 16% of the capacity. This will also be a bonus for Centrica which owns 20% of this EDF-operated business. Centrica has also had two gas stations included. 45% comes from gas fired plants and less than half a percent by those promising demand side reduction. Energy secretary Ed Davey said the auction had been a great success and would act as a guarantee to keep the lights on. He estimated it would add £11 to the average household energy bill in 2018/19. “This is fantastic news for bill-payers and businesses. We are guaranteeing security at the lowest cost for consumers. We’ve done this by ensuring that we get the best out of our existing power stations and unlocking new investment in flexible plant,” he said. Many of the contracts have been awarded for only one year. These are provisional results of the auction. All capacity agreements are subject to final confirmation from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which is expected no later than 5 January 2015. The final price below £20 per kW is way down from the £75 kW price where the auction started on Tuesday. The price is gradually reduced in a series of bidding sessions leaving only those able to offer low cost generation. Nuclear is well known to have very low operating costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/dec/28/sellafield-tory-conservative-byelection-cumbria-unions-copeland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-28T13:46:51Z","webTitle":"Sellafield unrest could dent Tory byelection chances, unions warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/28/sellafield-tory-conservative-byelection-cumbria-unions-copeland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/dec/28/sellafield-tory-conservative-byelection-cumbria-unions-copeland","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield unrest could dent Tory byelection chances, unions warn","bodyText":"“Serious industrial unrest” at Europe’s biggest nuclear site could threaten the Conservatives’ chances of winning a forthcoming byelection, unions have warned. The byelection in the marginal Cumbrian seat of Copeland has been described as “Theresa May’s to lose”. But the Conservative candidate hoping to overturn Labour’s 2,564 majority will have to explain to thousands of workers at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site why the government is trying to downgrade their final-salary pension scheme. Trade unions representing many of Sellafield’s 10,000 workers have written to the government warning they cannot support either of the options being considered. The Guardian has seen a letter sent shortly before Christmas to Lady Neville-Rolfe, minister of state at the business department. It comes from the Prospect union, which represents more than 5,000 Sellafield engineers and specialists. The letter, signed by Prospect’s deputy general secretary, Dai Hudd, on behalf of his union, the GMB, Unite and Aslef, tells the minister “serious industrial unrest” cannot be ruled out by workers employed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The NDA is the public body that owns Sellafield, a huge site in Copeland that processes nuclear waste from the old Windscale nuclear power station, where a fire in 1957 caused the UK’s worst nuclear accident. It says: “Employees across the NDA estate fought hard to secure the statutory pension protections that currently apply. There will be an understandable adverse reaction with any proposals that trample over those protections. “They will certainly not respond well to a raid on their pension benefits intended to achieve arbitrary savings agreed between the NDA and the Treasury, and agreement to which the workforce and their representatives played no part. “If the NDA proceeds with its proposed consultation in its current form there will inevitably be a significant reaction from the members affected. The likelihood of serious industrial unrest cannot be ruled out.” The two money-saving proposals on offer involve either a series of changes including increasing the pension age from 60 to 65 or state pension age (whichever is higher), or breaking the final-salary link for the pension scheme, according to Prospect. A 60-day consultation period on the options opens on 9 January. According to Hudd, either proposal will affect thousands of Sellafield employees as well as thousands of employees at other nuclear sites, some of which are also in the constituency. Each member of the scheme would lose tens of thousands on average, he claimed. “I expect the reaction will be particularly robust because this group of members were granted statutory pension protection in the legislation that effectively privatised the industry and these proposals would mean overriding those protections,” he told the Guardian. “There are few constituencies where a single industry (indeed employer) is as significant as the nuclear industry and Sellafield is to Copeland. For the government of the day to attack the pension terms for the employees in this industry in the run-up to a crucial byelection, there is incredibly bad timing to say the least.” A spokesman for the NDA said: “Government policy is that all public sector final-salary pensions schemes should reformed by 2018, and 4 million public sector workers have already moved to new pension arrangements. “Specific decisions on how to change the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s estate pension schemes have yet to be taken. We expect to begin formal consultation in the new year.” More than 10,000 people are employed at the Sellafield site, which measures 6 sq km and is the largest nuclear site in Europe, containing more than 1,000 nuclear facilities. Almost half of the UK’s nuclear workforce is based at Sellafield, which is home to among the largest inventories of untreated waste in the world. The NDA purpose is to deliver the decommissioning and cleanup of the UK’s civil nuclear legacy in a safe and cost-effective manner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/apr/02/doctors-reject-ama-chiefs-stance-on-hazelwood-closure-and-health","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-02T03:30:31Z","webTitle":"Doctors reject AMA chief’s stance on Hazelwood closure and health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/02/doctors-reject-ama-chiefs-stance-on-hazelwood-closure-and-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/apr/02/doctors-reject-ama-chiefs-stance-on-hazelwood-closure-and-health","fields":{"headline":"Doctors reject AMA chief’s stance on Hazelwood closure and health","bodyText":"Members of the Australian Medical Association have threatened to quit over comments by the national president, Dr Michael Gannon, that the impact of job losses from Victoria’s Hazelwood power plant closure should be considered as well as the health benefits. Gannon has been accused of contradicting clear AMA policy on clean air and going back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor, but the head of Australia’s peak medical body has denied both accusations. The AMA’s former vice president Dr Stephen Parnis told the Doctors for the Environment Australia conference on Sunday that Gannon’s comments were “a wilful distortion of AMA policy”. On Wednesday Gannon told Guardian Australia the health benefits of closing down brown coal power plants need to be considered alongside the health impacts of unemployment and blackouts. While he said the closure of the coal-fired plant was “good news” for children with asthma, the elderly and people who suffered respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, “there is also the health effects of unemployment that need to be considered”. “The Australian Medical Association has clear positions about the risk of providing energy supply through fossil fuels and specifically the risk of brown coal, but somewhere in this we would call for common sense,” he said. “We need stable base-load power as well, and we need grown-up conversations about gas and nuclear power while technology is developed to deliver renewable energy.” The AMA has received several letters of complaint from its members, including threats to quit the organisation, and accusations that Gannon has gone back on his pledge to be less political than his predecessor. One letter accused the AMA of supporting political statements instead of an “evidence-based approach” to health. “Yes, doctors know that unemployment is destructive to health, but [that] didn’t prevent the AMA from making a stand against the tobacco industry, with resultant lack of jobs,” the letter said. “Unless this issue is addressed urgently, the world is likely to overshoot the 2C guardrail of warming, creating huge health, social and economic disruption. I would hope the AMA looks at the science rather than the politics, and actually leads rather than follows the politicians from both our major political parties.” A response by the AMA’s director of public health, Simon Tatz, sought to reassure that the AMA “believes that climate change poses a significant worldwide threat to health, and urgent action is required to reduce this potential harm”. “While I can understand your concern at the comments that were recently made, I urge you to consider the AMA’s stated policy positions on climate change and human health,” Tatz said. On Sunday Parnis said Gannon’s comments were a “wilful distortion of AMA policy” and could be interpreted as “trying to put a handbrake on the health benefits of what was a commercial decision to close the Hazelwood power station”. “I have some hesitation in saying that, but I think it was a distortion, a misrepresentation of the AMA policy, of which I remain very proud,” he said. Parnis also suggested Gannon had not acknowledged the health effects of the power station on the people of the La Trobe valley over decades, which Gannon has disputed. Parnis had not spoken publicly about the AMA since he left his role as vice president in May, but told Guardian Australia he though the issue was too important to stay quiet. Parnis oversaw the renewal and review of the clean air policy in 2015 and told Guardian Australia he “took exception” to Gannon’s comments, as did a number of other members. “It’s hard to be clear about the level of antipathy towards what was said,” he said. “There is a spectrum of opinion in a broad church like the AMA, but I certainly didn’t hear anyone happy with them.” Gannon said he was aware of the complaints, but said neither he nor the AMA equated the loss of jobs at Hazelwood with the environmental and health benefits that would come from its closure. “The AMA is one of the leading advocates on the issue of climate health,” he said. “It’s just that the AMA has a global view on all of these issues, and I think we can walk and chew gum at same time.” Gannon said he was pointing out there were health impacts from unemployment and carbon abatement, but was at no stage suggesting it was of equal priority to the health benefits of closing a power station which relied on “the dirtiest form of coal”. “We need to be cleverer and smarter about carbon abatement and the necessary changes in society to reduce the impacts of climate change,” he said. “The necessary changes in changing our energy mix and reducing pollution will have victims and we just need to think about that.” Asked to elaborate on his earlier comments suggesting the right balance had not yet been struck before closing Hazelwood, Gannon said a safe base-load power had to be ensured as Australia moved towards a greater renewable proportion in the energy mix, and cited the South Australian blackout. “We just need a secure energy supply, and that does not for one minute diminish very clear AMA policy which is there,” he said. “Every member that telephoned or emailed the AMA was responded to and they were pointed in the direction of our policy which talks about all of this – the need to reduce the carbon footprint of our society.” Gannon said he wasn’t being political as the power plant was being shut down by a French multinational corporation, and said while climate change was “highly political” he had not been taking a political line."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-accused-backing-down-hinkley-point-c-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T19:00:41Z","webTitle":"Theresa May accused of avoiding security and cost issues of Hinkley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-accused-backing-down-hinkley-point-c-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/theresa-may-accused-backing-down-hinkley-point-c-deal","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May accused of avoiding security and cost issues of Hinkley","bodyText":"Theresa May was accused of backing down on security concerns about Chinese involvement in nuclear power and failing to drive a better deal for taxpayers, following the announcement on Thursday on building the £18bn Hinkley Point C plant. May’s surprise decision to review the first planned nuclear power station for a generation when she arrived in Downing Street had been regarded as marking a break with George Osborne’s enthusiastic courtship of China, and a greater willingness to take on big business. But after the Chinese ambassador publicly raised concerns about future trading relationships if Britain pulled the plug on the deal, May gave the go-ahead. On Thursday Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat business secretary, said that the prime minister had ducked an opportunity to revisit the economics of the Hinkley contract – which will entail the Treasury promising a guaranteed floor price for the electricity generated, paid for through householders’ bills, over the reactor’s lifetime. “Over the last few weeks we have been marched up the hill and back here,” Cable said. “Maybe she just wanted to demonstrate that this had her fingerprints on it.The biggest issues around Hinkley are the price, and the technology, and those remain unchanged. The big question is about the economics of it, and that is still unresolved, and worrying.” The government has guaranteed a price of £92.50 to EDF for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, despite concerns that that is more than double the current market rate. Cable called for May to take a tougher approach to other looming infrastructure decisions, including the proposed third runway at Heathrow, and the HS2 high-speed rail project. “There are problems with each of the three Hs,” he said. The government insisted the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset was being approved with “significant new safeguards” to make sure China and other foreign investors could not own stakes in British nuclear plants without UK government approval. However, Labour and environmental groups described the new security measures as mere “window dressing” and “hot air”, which would change very little about the project, since the price would remain the same and the power to block mergers on security grounds already existed in law. Under the new proposals, EDF, the French firm building the plant with a £6bn investment from a Chinese-state nuclear firm, will not be able to sell on its ownership without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a “special share” that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns. But in a signal that the requirements may not be very stringent, both EDF and China General Nuclear (CGN) said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed would let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK. The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said the government had “backed down with a whimper” over its security concerns about Chinese involvement, saying it had announced “new powers they already possess”. He told Greg Clark, the business secretary: “They have claimed they introduced significant new safeguards into this package. The secretary of state already has such powers. Will the secretary of state acknowledge that he can prevent the sale of any element of critical infrastructure?” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the government’s review seemed “to have been a lot of hot air”. The Chinese are particularly keen to proceed with a new nuclear plant at Bradwell in Essex because it will be their own design built under the UK’s tough safety regulations, allowing the company to use it as a showcase to the rest of the world. CGN sources indicated they hoped to submit their formal plans for approval this autumn. “We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy,” CGN said. “CGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years’ experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs.” Clark said the new security restrictions were an improvement, claiming EDF would have otherwise been at liberty to sell its stake on. His department for business, energy and industrial strategy confirmed that this was the only new security requirement for Hinkley to proceed. Before an announcement in the Commons, Clark said: “Britain needs to upgrade its supplies of energy, and we have always been clear that nuclear is an important part of ensuring our future low-carbon energy security.” The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, tweeted that it was excellent news that the Hinkley project was going ahead and that it would be a boost for jobs in France. Michel Sapin, the French finance and economy minister, said it was an “undeniable success for French industry” and would be “a big contribution to supporting employment in France”. Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF group, said: “The decision of the British government to approve the construction of Hinkley Point C marks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-byelections-as-much-about-labour-as-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T13:57:45Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on byelections: as much about Labour as Brexit | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-byelections-as-much-about-labour-as-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-byelections-as-much-about-labour-as-brexit","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on byelections: as much about Labour as Brexit","bodyText":"Parliamentary byelections always tell an important story, but care is always needed in putting those stories into a national context. Yesterday’s two byelections in formerly deep-dyed traditional Labour seats fit that mould. The big headline is Trudy Harrison’s capture of Copeland for the Conservatives. The Tories and their press supporters will understandably be cock-a-hoop. Labour dismay at the loss will trigger more recriminations. Yet Labour held on in Stoke Central, a contest in which many initially wrote them off, and even increased their margin of victory compared with 2015. The threatened Ukip landslide, widely taken for granted beforehand, never happened. The Liberal Democrats’ recent surge was not repeated either. The Conservative victory in Copeland is without question an exceptional result for Theresa May and a humbling for Jeremy Corbyn. Some of that is down to local factors, in particular the Labour leader’s dislike of the nuclear power industry on which west Cumbria is so economically dependent. The region is one of many in which traditional Labour voters still baulk at switching to the Tories, but when so many jobs are at stake it can happen. No governing party has won a byelection from the main opposition party since 1982 and yesterday was only the fourth time this has happened since 1945. The Tory capture of Copeland thus sends a big message. It underlines Mrs May’s and the Tories’ current and growing ascendancy in English politics. But it also hints at the larger potential of Mrs May’s form of conservatism to capture the centre ground of English politics – though she will have to persuade her party too . Yet in another sense the Tory win was hardly a bolt from the blue. The Copeland result was broadly in line with the latest Guardian/ICM national opinion poll, which had reported an enormous 18-point Tory lead over Labour. Crudely extrapolated, that poll would have pointed to a four per cent Tory win in Copeland and a six-point Labour win in Stoke. In fact Ms Harrison took Copeland by seven points, while Gareth Snell won by 12 in Stoke Central – not an enormous difference. The results therefore confirm the very obvious and well-established national truth, that Mrs May’s Tories are much more popular than Mr Corbyn’s Labour party, and getting more so. Yet the byelection results support a second important conclusion as well. They seriously undermine the lazy assumption, peddled especially by some of the rightwing press but swallowed also by some in Labour and repeated in Mr Corbyn’s speech today, that the referendum redefined British party politics at a stroke. Both these constituencies were very clear Brexit supporters in 2016, yet their votes for Brexit did not give the byelections a new shape. Instead their shape is recognisably an old one. In Stoke, the shifts in party share of the vote between 2015 and 2017 were small. Even in Copeland they were modest. These byelections look more like traditional contests between England’s four main parties (five if you count the Greens) than local reruns of the Brexit argument. They were arguably at least as much about May versus Corbyn as about Britain and the EU. In some ways, therefore, the biggest losers this week were Ukip. When the byelections were triggered, many assumed that the seats, Stoke in particular, might be Ukip’s for the taking. Perhaps they might have been if the view that Brexit has revolutionised everything had been right. But it wasn’t. Ukip’s arrogance, divisions and obsessions were not what the voters turned out to want. Paul Nuttall, the party leader, staked his future on winning in Stoke. His flaws were ruthlessly exposed, in the press and on the stump. His future must therefore be in doubt. Another round of the Ukip leadership soap opera may beckon. Ukip is not dead. But claims that it is poised to sweep Labour aside have underestimated the good sense of the voters. Nevertheless, both contests were in seats that Labour has held since before the second world war. These are seats which it should have retained with ease if it was an effective opposition. In some of the earlier byelections in this parliament – such as Oldham West, Sheffield Brightside and Tooting – Labour did quite respectably. But not this week. The Labour vote was down by two points from 2015 in Stoke and by five in Copeland. There is nothing here for Labour to celebrate. The 2015 election was already a low base, from which Labour has once again declined. These results point to the continuing erosion of Labour as a credible governing party in modern Britain under Mr Corbyn. Maybe this is not terminal decline, but that is hardly a consolation for Labour wellwishers. Yes, Labour survives. But to what end? What is today’s Labour party for? This is a question which needs a better answer than Mr Corbyn is offering."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/apr/03/donald-trump-shock-tactics-north-korea-work","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T17:30:45Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump’s shock tactics on North Korea may just work | Ian Birrell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/03/donald-trump-shock-tactics-north-korea-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/03/donald-trump-shock-tactics-north-korea-work","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump’s shock tactics on North Korea may just work","bodyText":"Song Byeok used to paint propaganda pictures for North Korea’s dictators. But when famine struck, his family was starving like millions of others, so they tried to flee. His father drowned crossing a swollen river to China and Song begged soldiers to help him. Instead they sent him to a labour camp, where the hunger and torture was so extreme he envied those dying all around him. “I just wanted to get it over quickly,” he said. This slight man told me he lost almost five stone, along with a finger that rotted away. The prisoners were woken at five each morning, forced to run everywhere carrying heavy materials, beaten constantly by guards. The only food was boiled corn soup. As people withered away, they were sent to hospital units. “If you woke the person next to you might have starved to death, but you would not tell the guards until after the next meal so you could have their food,” he said. Eventually there were so many corpses lying around that the camp had a clear out, sending Song home to die. But he survived, escaped the nightmare of life in the world’s most locked-down state, and today paints subversive pictures of the regime that once held him trapped in fear. Some mock the Supreme Leader, since few artists were permitted to draw his sacred face. Other pictures have birds on barbed wire, symbolising freedom. “The lives of North Korean citizens are worse than those of pets in this country,” he said, when we met last year in South Korea’s capital Seoul. His tale is tragic. It is also typical of those fortunate few who have escaped North Korea. One female dissident told me that 30 women in her army unit were raped by their commander. Another learned that his fiancee’s face was smashed to a pulp in retaliation for his defection. A third was thrown into a concentration camp as a child for his grandfather’s transgressions, where he survived by eating lizards and was forced to stone dangling bodies of execution victims. Such is the harsh reality of life behind the bamboo curtain. There are, sadly, many nations with hideous human rights records. But no other place on Earth has an estimated 120,000 people stuck in those gruesome gulags and punishes three generations of a family if one member upsets those in charge. North Korea is often seen as a joke, a crazy place ruled by a crazy guy with a sharp haircut. But a nation of 25 million is being suffocated by a bunch of barbaric, corrupt rulers who are entirely rational in how they protect their own interests and pampered lifestyles. That maverick image and shuttered society helps a weak nation keep both enemies and modernity at bay. This is why, for once, I agree with Donald Trump when he demands solutions for this long-running sore that stains our world. The American president intends to press China’s leader Xi Jinping on this issue when they meet at his Florida home later this week. “China has great influence over North Korea,” he said correctly. “And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won’t.” He declined to say what action he would take if they refuse, as frequently before, but he added: “If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will.” His secretary of state has already said pre-emptive military action is an option. North Korea is a nuclear power, so sabre-rattling talk from Trump is scary stuff. And yes, he is acting out of self-interest. Last year alone, Kim Jong-un carried out more ballistic missile tests than his father did in almost two decades of rule. Few outside Pyongyang know if there is any truth in his boasts that North Korea will soon have the missile range to reach America, but clearly the arsenal is advancing very fast under the third generation of this vile family dictatorship. Since no one knows how Kim would react if confronted by significant internal challenge – although the omens are alarming – this neofascist regime must be thwarted before its threat intensifies still further. Bear in mind that this is a country kept always on a war footing and fed ceaseless claims that an attack by South Korea and the US is imminent. I saw glimpses of this at propaganda shows in Pyongyang in 2013 featuring thousands of well-drilled people promoting a highly twisted history, then at a circus with stunning military performers on horseback (plus the revolting sight of ice-skating bears and baboons). Sanctions, aid and attempts at engagement have made little impact. So if the world is to avoid potentially terrifying conflict and free 25 million imprisoned people, change must come through China – its strongest ally and main source of food, arms and energy. Beijing is often annoyed by its unruly neighbour but is more fearful of North Korean collapse. It does not want hordes of hungry refugees pouring over its border. Nor does it want a unified, thriving and democratic Korea, friendly to the US and hostile to its own growing influence. Trump’s tough task is to exert enough pressure on China for it to see national interests are better served by ending support for such a rogue nation. Whether for reasons of realpolitik or human rights, the rest of the world should also stop turning a blind eye to bloodstained depravity. North Korea has become more repressive, bolder and better armed under Kim Jong-un. Perhaps it takes a maverick president to stop this maverick dictator."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2016/nov/25/children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-25T11:23:04Z","webTitle":"The Children review – Kirkwood's slow-burning drama asks profound questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/25/children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2016/nov/25/children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court","fields":{"headline":"The Children review – Kirkwood's slow-burning drama asks profound questions","bodyText":"Lucy Kirkwood astonished us in 2013 with the epic scope of Chimerica, dealing with global politics. She now follows it with a three-character play which, although smaller in scale, still impresses by its capacity to raise big issues; in particular how people in the future will react to the poisoned legacy of the present. The problem with most post-apocalyptic plays is that they confront us with a totally unrecognisable world: Kirkwood, however, suggests people still listen to Radio 4 and dance to James Brown. Hazel and Robin, two retired nuclear scientists living in a coastal cottage in the wake of a disaster at a local power station, seek to preserve a semblance of normality. Even though electricity is rationed and a Geiger counter is on hand to check for signs of radiation, Robin now farms, the super-organised Hazel practises yoga and the pair keep in touch with their eldest daughter. But when Rose, a fellow nuclear physicist whom they haven’t seen for 38 years, suddenly turns up, their precariously ordered existence is disrupted. Has Rose come to reignite her old affair with Robin or does she have some darker purpose? We are well into Kirkwood’s two-hour play before we have an answer. While Ibsen could get away, as in Rosmersholm, with a play that recapitulates the past to explain the present, I wished that Kirkwood had cut more quickly to the main moral dilemma. But, once it shifts into fourth gear, her play grips compulsively. Kirkwood brilliantly contrasts two women with polarised, but equally valid attitudes. It is not simply that Hazel has four children while Rose has chosen childlessness. It is that Hazel, even in a time of crisis, exudes domestic efficiency and argues: “If you’re not going to grow, don’t live.” Rose, you feel, takes life as it comes and is more reckless. The skill of the play lies in debating which of the two, when the chips are down, has the more active conscience. It’s a slow-burn play but one that raises profound questions about whether having children sharpens, or diminishes, one’s sense of social responsibility. James Macdonald’s production and Miriam Buether’s design are equally meticulous in creating a world of precarious normality: the cottage itself is almost spartan in its severity. The performances are also very good. Deborah Findlay as Hazel is the epitome of rural capability yet subtly hints at her unresolved rage, based on past experience, towards her unwanted visitor. Francesca Annis as Rose cleverly suggests a woman who nurses private and public secrets and who is insouciantly aware of her sexual power. The hardest part is that of Robin, but Ron Cook admirably conveys the unreformed roguishness of a one-time laboratory lech. Kirkwood takes her time. She has, however, written a genuinely disturbing play: one not simply about nuclear power but about the heavy price we may pay in the future for the profligacy of the present. Whether you are a parent or not, the play leaves you an abundance of ideas on which to ruminate. • At the Royal Court, London, until 14 January.

Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia (BCA) also called for no further changes to the renewable energy target (RET), given it was the foundation significant investments. She also said there was no need for state-based targets. Westacott, representing the biggest businesses in the country, argued that in the medium to long term, an EIS was both technology-neutral and would provide the policy signal currently missing to drive investment in energy. “Australia’s 2030 emissions target has been set,” Westacott said. “What’s missing is the signal that will support the investment needed for the electricity system. “A signal such as an emissions intensity scheme for electricity is both fuel- and technology-neutral and preserves the broadest range of options to meet future emissions reduction targets. “It also creates an incentive for investment in lower emissions generation technologies.” But she warned that if an EIS was imposed too quickly, it could lead to multiple closures in regional communities and place more pressure on energy security. “Without access to competitively priced gas, an emissions intensity scheme could lead to multiple closures within one region in the short term, placing pressure on system security and regional communities all at once,” Westacott said. She said an emissions cap should be applied to coal-fired power stations to ensure they do not extend their operating lives. “While less efficient than an emissions intensity scheme, the transition may be easier to manage and provide clearer signals for new investment in the electricity system in the short term,” she said. The BCA’s submission is the latest to urge the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to recommend an EIS for the energy sector, effectively imposing a carbon price. Other groups calling for an EIS or carbon market mechanism include Energy Networks Australia, retailer Energy Australia, electricity provider AGL, the Climate Change Authority, the National Farmers Federation and the CSIRO. Energy policy remains front and centre for the federal government following Malcolm Turnbull’s meeting with gas chiefs to address domestic shortages and his plan for a 50% expansion in the Snowy Hydro scheme. Finkel is investigating the best way to provide security for the national electricity market at a time of rapid change in climate and technology. After the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, openly canvassed an EIS as one of Finkel’s options, conservatives in the Coalition party room including senior government minister Christopher Pyne objected vociferously. It led to Turnbull and Frydenberg dumping the scheme within days and was noted by the former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi as one of the last straws that drove him to establish his own party. Notwithstanding the split, Finkel’s preliminary report gave guarded support to an EIS 24 hours after the government ruled out the scheme. The Coalition won the 2013 election on the back of Tony Abbott’s anti-carbon tax policy and subsequently dismantled the carbon market system implemented by the Gillard government, with support from the Business Council. On Thursday, Westacott said numerous modelling exercises had demonstrated an emissions intensity scheme for electricity would manage carbon abatement objectives at the least cost. “An emissions intensity scheme provides a subsidy for less emissions-intensive generation with the cost of the scheme paid for by more emissions-intensive generators,” Westacott said. “The net effect should be no increase in price for customers.” As the government prepares for the closure of the Hazelwood on March 31 with the loss of 1,000 jobs, Westacott said better market information was required to support the transition of the electricity sector, including three years’ notice for power station closures. “To enable effective system planning and support efficient decision making, the quality of market information could be improved by publishing aggregate fuel supplies for each region over a period of time,” Westacott said. “To support a managed transition of the electricity sector, a three-year notice period for the withdrawal of large generators and consumers could be considered. This would also give communities time to adjust. “We also need stable policy frameworks with minimal government intervention in markets to support electricity investment. Policies that suddenly shift from one place to another or see governments entering markets risk jeopardising, or at the very least confusing, this investment.” As the Turnbull government continues to attack state renewable energy targets, Westacott backed the federal government by saying state based RETs were not necessary but urged the Coalition not to change the federal RET again. “Although renewable energy targets are a source of market distortion, the RET has underpinned significant investments and it should be left alone,” Westacott said. “To make further changes would have a chilling impact on investment right across the sector. There is also no role for state-based renewable energy targets.” The BCA has argued the recommendations must ensure security of supply and restore community confidence in the national electricity market while creating conditions for energy investment to improve energy affordability. It also recommends all energy options should be kept on the table, including nuclear power, coal, gas-fired generation and capture and storage. Finkel is expected to make recommendations within the next four months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2020/may/24/coronavirus-live-news-6m-australians-download-tracing-app-as-experts-fear-second-wave-in-us-summer","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-24T23:33:45Z","webTitle":"Austria's president apologises for Covid-19 curfew breach – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/24/coronavirus-live-news-6m-australians-download-tracing-app-as-experts-fear-second-wave-in-us-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/may/24/coronavirus-live-news-6m-australians-download-tracing-app-as-experts-fear-second-wave-in-us-summer","fields":{"headline":"Austria's president apologises for Covid-19 curfew breach – as it happened","bodyText":"We’ve launched a new blog at the link below - head there for the latest coronavirus news from around the world: UK Doctors condemn secrecy over false negative Covid-19 tests Doctors’ leaders have condemned ministers and Public Health England (PHE) for throwing a “shroud of secrecy” over how many coronavirus tests on NHS staff and patients produce wrong results. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) has demanded an end to “evasion” and the “wall of silence” around how many swab tests result in false negative readings. The tests, in which samples are taken from someone’s throat and nose, are vital in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in hospitals because they are used to check whether NHS personnel and inpatients have the virus and might unwittingly pass it on. A top White House official on Sunday likened China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union’s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, Reuters reports. National security adviser Robert O’Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. “They unleashed a virus on the world that’s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we’re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus,” O’Brien said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The number of confirmed cases rose by 115 to 144,921, health ministry data showed, and the death toll increased by 35 to 28,367 - an increase of just 0.1% for both tallies. The weekend totals for new cases and deaths were also both the lowest since France began easing its strict coronavirus restrictions on 11 May. Epidemiologist Laurent Toubiana, director of the IRSAN health data institute, suggested the worst of the epidemic had passed and said the coronavirus may not come back, unlike previous pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu. “If we do not see a quick resurgence of the epidemic, we might get a break for a few weeks,” he said on BFM TV. Despite the easing of restrictions, social distancing rules remain in place in France and Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne told France Inter radio the government did not want people to travel abroad this summer. She also said Paris parks must remain closed for now as the capital is still a “red zone” for circulation of the coronavirus. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you on the blog now. I’ll be bringing you the latest updates from around the world. It’s always good to hear from you – get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. The Daily Mail - usually one of Boris Johnson’s supporters in the press - has called on the prime minister to sack Dominic Cummings, trailing its headline with the following: In the clearest way, Dominic Cummings has violated the spirit and letter of the lockdown. Boris Johnson says he ‘totally gets’ how the public feels about this. Clearly he totally doesn’t. Neither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust. Do they think we are fools? For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs. No buts. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world No. 2 hot spot for coronavirus cases. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the US, but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the new countries. Brazil became the No. 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The decision follows comments by the national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, to CBS. “We hope that’ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we’re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,” O’Brien said. It’s safe to say Dominic Cummings has received a rather... mixed reception across tomorrow’s front pages. In the US, discrepancies in how different states are reporting testing and infection figures is causing “frustration and confusion”, AP reports. Elected officials, businesses and others are depending on coronavirus testing and infection-rate data as states reopen so that they will know if a second wave of contagion is coming and whether another round of stay-at-home orders or closings might be needed. But states are reporting those figures in different ways, and that can lead to frustration and confusion about what the numbers mean. In some places, there have been data gaps that leave local leaders wondering whether they should loosen or tighten restrictions. In others, officials are accused of spinning the numbers to make their states look better and justify reopening. In a continuing theme for the outbreak in the United States, a lack of federal leadership persists. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been lumping together tests that measure different things. Such errors render the CDC numbers about how many Americans are infected uninterpretable, creating a misleading picture for people trying to make decisions based on the data, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvards Global Health Institute. “It is incumbent on health departments and the CDC to make sure they’re presenting information thats accurate. And if they cant get it, then don’t show the data at all,” Jha said. “Faulty data is much, much worse than no data.” “Eid is not Eid with the atmosphere of coronavirus - people feel a sense of fear,” worshipper Akram Taher said in Gaza. Muslims around the world have been marking a sombre Eid al-Fitr, as coronavirus lockdowns worldwide restrict celebrations. Mass prayer gatherings have been banned in many countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and Syria. Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, began a five-day round-the-clock curfew from Saturday after infections more than quadrupled since the start of Ramadan to over 72,000 - the highest in the Gulf. In Afghanistan, the Taliban announced a three-day ceasefire to mark Eid al-Fitr in a surprise move following months of bloody fighting with Afghan forces after the signing of a landmark agreement with the United States. In Somalia, at least five people were killed and more than 20 wounded in a blast during Eid festivities, police said. New York recorded 109 deaths from Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, which represents a slight increase on the previous day. State governor Andrew Cuomo called on New Yorkers to remain vigilant. “What do we really think, this is the last time we are going to have a public health emergency?” Cuomo said. “Let’s make sure we are better for what we have gone through.” Over on the UK side, the Guardian’s Carole Cadwalladr and Paul Lewis tally the dissenting advisors: Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of “hard negotiations”, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. Flights will restart under an easing of restrictions, despite the 6,767 new cases that brought India’s total to over 131,000. Airlines are preparing to resume about a third of their domestic flight operations from Monday, even without clarity over what quarantine rules may apply to passengers. The western state of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu in the south and West Bengal in the east - business hubs and home to India’s busiest airports - had said they were not prepared to open for flights as coronavirus cases rose, state government officials said. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu agreed to operate limited flights from Monday, while southern state of Andhra Pradesh would allow flights from Tuesday, India’s civil aviation minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, said on Twitter. “It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state government to recommence civil aviation operations in the country ... Domestic flights will recommence across the country from tomorrow,” he said. West Bengal urged the central government to postpone the resumption of passenger flights to Kolkata as it focuses on rescue work after Cyclone Amphan hit the city. Limited aviation operations in West Bengal will commence from Thursday, Puri said. India’s federal structure gives its 28 states flexibility to set their own rules, complicating government efforts to kickstart the economy.

Chile’s healthcare system is “very close to the limit,” President Sebastian Pinera has said, following a rapid rise in infections in recent days that has brought the country’s total close to 70,000. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. “We are very close to the limit because we have had a very large increase in the needs and demands for medical care, and for intensive care unit beds and ventilators,” Pinera said during a visit to a hospital in Santiago, which has the highest concentration of cases. Here’s the latest sticky development to the Dominic Cummings story. Dominic Cummings is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees has made a complaint to the police after reporting that he saw Cummings and his family on 12 April walking in the town of Barnard Castle before getting into a car, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Mirror can reveal. (For those who’ve missed an episode or two in the saga, here’s a run-through of the chief advisor’s movements.) Up to speed? Read Matthew Weaver and Vikram Dodd’s report on the latest. More details on South Africa’s plans for easing the lockdown easing have just come through. President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the controversial ban on the sale of alcohol would be lifted for home consumption when the country moves into level three of a five-tier coronavirus lockdown next month. South Africans were prohibited from buying alcohol and cigarettes when the country locked down at the end of March, in an attempt to prevent a surge in violence and ease pressure on hospitals’ emergency wards. Alcohol will be sold for home consumption under strict conditions, on certain days and within limited hours. The ban on tobacco products, however, will remain in place “due to the health risks associated with smoking”, the president said. In what has become a regular fixture of recent weeks, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has once more encouraged a rally in the country’s capital to back his administration, days after Brazil passed Russia to become the world’s No 2 coronavirus hotspot after the US. Surrounded by security guards wearing masks, but not wearing one himself, Bolsonaro was shown in a livestreaming video on his Facebook page greeting protesters waving Brazilian flags. The rally came as the US president, Donald Trump – a close ally of the far-right Brazilian leader – considers a ban on travel from Brazil amid the worsening outbreak there. The pro-Bolsonaro demonstration also follows a brewing political scandal revolving around an accusation by former justice minister Sergio Moro, a popular anti-graft crusader, that Bolsonaro aimed to interfere in police investigations. Brazil’s federal supreme court released a video last week of an April 22 ministerial meeting in which Bolsonaro said he wanted to change security officials, their bosses or even ministers to stop his family and friends from getting “screwed”. Brazil’s health ministry announced on Sunday 16,508 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total above 347,000, while the death toll increased by 965 to 22,013. Austrian president Alexander Van der Bellen has apologised after staying at a restaurant past the 11 pm closing time mandated by the government as part of its anti-coronavirus measures. “I went out for the first time since the lockdown with two friends and my wife,” Van der Bellen tweeted on Sunday, adding: “We then lost track of time while chatting. I’m sincerely sorry. It was a mistake.” The president linked to an article in the Kurier newspaper according to which a police patrol found the president and his wife on the terrace of an Italian restaurant in central Vienna shortly after midnight on Sunday morning. Restaurants and cafes were allowed to re-open last week on the condition they adhere to a number of rules, including the 11 pm closing time. The restaurant’s owner told the Krone newspaper that he thought he had followed the rules by stopping service at 11 pm, believing customers were allowed to stay on the terrace past that time. The restaurant could potentially be fined for a breach of the new restrictions and Van der Bellen says he will “take responsibility” if the restaurant owner suffers any losses as result of the incident. South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. “Cabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,” he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. France has said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 144,921 from 144,806 on Saturday. The number of people in hospital rose to 17,185 from 17,178, while the number of people in intensive care fell to 1,655 from 1,665. Israel’s cabinet has curtailed the involvement of its internal security agency, Shin Bet, in the cellphone tracking of people infected by the coronavirus, saying the measure would be a last resort. The cabinet had circumvented parliament in March and approved emergency regulations to allow the use of the technology, usually deployed for anti-terrorism. Privacy watchdog groups have challenged the practice in court. In light of falling contagion rates in Israel, phone tracking is now warranted “in specific and special cases only, where location … cannot be completed with epidemiological investigation using other methods”. This may be reviewed if infections surge. Global toll passes 340,000 The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 5,344,539, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been 342,695 deaths officially linked to coronavirus around the world. Boris Johnson has backed Dominic Cummings, following reports his chief strategist broke lockdown rules on more than one occasion. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting “responsibly, legally and with integrity”. The US is likely to impose travel restrictions on Brazil on Sunday, the White House national security adviser has said, after the South American country became the nation with the second most coronavirus cases. The country became the No 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country’s toll up to 6,380. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. The service took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. South Africa’s AngloGold Ashanti has suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. The mining company said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. Contact tracing and sanitisation processes are under way. China’s top diplomat Wang Yi has said the US should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, instead of smearing the country. State councillor Wang’s comments came as he expressed his sympathy to the US for the pandemic, where the death toll is approaching 100,000. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Italy has recorded 50 new deaths – but worst-hit Lombardy’s figures are missing due to late reporting. The number of new infections rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has backed his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, amid pressure for his resignation after it was revealed he broke lockdown rules on multiple occasions. Here are some of the key points from the UK briefing for those who missed it. Johnson described Cummings as having acted “responsibly, legally and with integrity”. He said the adviser had “followed the instincts of every father and every parent” in travelling to find the right kind of childcare at the moment when “both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated” and he does not “mark him down for that”. The PM avoided directly answering whether he was aware at the time that Cummings was travelling to Durham, and if he approved it. There were 50 new coronavirus deaths in Italy on Sunday. However, the civil protection authority said the latest figures did not include deaths in the worst-hit Lombardy region due to late reporting. New cases rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered. Gyms and swimming pools will reopen in all regions apart from Lombardy on Monday as part of Italy’s phased easing of restrictions. South Africa’s AngloGold Ashanti said on Sunday it had suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. This follows the news that 53 employees at the world’s deepest mine had tested positive. AngloGold Ashanti said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. “This process has indicated 164 positive cases with only a handful of tests left to process,” the company said in a statement, adding that the “vast majority” of cases were asymptomatic. Operations at Mponeng mine have been “temporarily halted” to complete contact tracing and “sanitise the workplace”. The UK’s daily coronavirus briefing has started, led by Boris Johnson. It comes as several Conservative MPs have called for Dominic Cummings to resign following reports that he breached the lockdown on more than one occasion. My colleague Aaron Walawalkar will steer you through it here: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country’s toll up to 6,380. The US is likely to impose travel restrictions on Brazil on Sunday, the White House national security adviser has said, after the South American country became the nation with the second most coronavirus cases. Robert O’Brien told CBS’s Face the Nation he believed there would be a decision on Sunday about suspending entry for those coming from Brazil. The country became the No 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. “We hope that’ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we’re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,” O’Brien said. He said restrictions for other countries in the southern hemisphere would be considered on a country-by-country basis. The national security adviser’s comments follow Donald Trump saying on Tuesday he was considering imposing a travel ban. “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either. We’re helping Brazil with ventilators … Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it,” Trump told reporters at the White House. The US imposed travel restrictions on China in January, and on Europe in early March. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. Services have been allowed in Hesse, the state Frankfurt is in, since 1 May, under the condition they follow strict distancing and hygiene rules. The service in question took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. “This situation shows how important it is that all of us stay alert and avoid becoming careless, especially now during the easing of restrictions. The virus is still there and will spread,” Hesse state health minister Kai Klose said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen to 178,281, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 31 to 8,247.

The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, was branded a “killer” by his opponents after he popped out for a Saturday night hot dog on the day a further 965 of his citizens were reported to have died from Covid-19, Tom Phillips reports. Insults hurled at Bolsonaro as he grappled with his fast food dinner included: “assassino” (killer), garbage and fascist. One female dissenter can be heard screaming: “Get to work, you bum!” Here is the report in full: Spain has recorded 70 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing its toll to 28,752, the country’s health ministry says. The number of diagnosed cases rose to 235,772 from 235,290. On top of that, here is some very welcome artistic succour. The Venice Film Festival will go ahead as scheduled at the beginning of September, according to Luca Zaia, the governor of the region around the Italian city. Organised by the Biennale di Venezia company, Venice is the world’s longest-running film festival, Reuters reports. In January it announced that Cate Blanchett would preside over its 77th edition. Due to the lockdowns imposed on the film industry across the world to limit the spread of the virus, the festival will probably be attended by fewer productions, said Zaia, who is also a board member of the Biennale di Venezia. The Cannes Film Festival, the world’s largest, was forced to postpone its latest edition in May due to the virus epidemic. Italy plans to lift all travel curbs from 3 June and travellers from European Union countries will be able to enter without going into quarantine. The country recorded 119 new deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic on Saturday, bringing the death toll in Italy from the outbreak to 32,735, the third-highest total in the world after the United States and the United Kingdom.

Rob Smyth has all the action: Here’s a useful video for anyone wondering what has been happening with the Dominic Cummings lockdown breach story in the UK. This morning he said he did not travel to Durham a second time when he was asked by reporters on his doorstep, before going to Downing Street – from where he appears not to have emerged as yet. Staying in Jerusalem, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre reopened to visitors today after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. The church, situated in Jerusalem’s Old City, is the site where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified, entombed, and resurrected. The Christian authorities managing the site closed it to visitors in March to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but clerics maintained prayers inside the shuttered church throughout its closure. Upon its reopening, church authorities limited entrance to 50 people at a time, and required that those entering the cavernous site maintain social distance and avoid touching any of the church’s stones, icons or other religious items. A typical day before the Covid-19 outbreak would bring thousands of faithful who kissed or placed their hands along the church’s surfaces. As priests from the various Christian sects entered the church, a handful of faithful waited outside for the basilica’s church to open for the public, AP reports. Authorities in Israel have gradually reopened schools, houses of worship and markets as the spread of coronavirus has slowed. The country’s health ministry has reported over 16,700 confirmed cases of the disease and 279 deaths. More than 14,000 have recovered. Here is Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israel prime minister, wearing a face mask inside court as his high-profile corruption trial opens. Oliver Holmes reports here: Istanbul has become the world’s largest diaspora hub for Uighurs fleeing Chinese persecution. They are celebrating Eid, but for many the pain of being away from their homeland is acute. Bethan McKernan has this report. Celebrating the Muslim holiday is a freedom Gül and her four children did not have at home in China’s western Xinjiang province, the Uighur homeland, where over the last few years the authorities have suffocated the ethnic minority’s cultural practices and turned the entire region into a police state subject to strict surveillance even inside their homes. Up to 1 million people have disappeared into re-education camps in what China says is a necessary measure to stamp out extremism. “I miss my homeland and my family every day. I cry a lot with the pain,” she said at her home in Istanbul’s Zeytinburnu neighbourhood. “I love life in Istanbul. I wish they could be here too. My children have freedom here we could not imagine before.” Full piece: The French government does not want its citizens to travel abroad this summer and recommends they take their holidays in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne says. Earlier this month, president Emmanuel Macron said it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer and that even trips within Europe may have to be limited to reduce the risk of a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic. Borne, in an interview with France Inter radio, also said that next week the government would decide on possibly loosening rules on French domestic travel, currently limited to a maximum 100 kilometres from home. She said Paris parks had to remain closed for now, as the capital was still a “red zone” for virus circulation, Reuters reports. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has repeatedly called on the government to reopen parks as Parisians, who mostly live in apartments without gardens, tend to congregate around the closed parks where it is difficult to respect social distancing rules. Our US coronavirus live blog, which will include reaction to the controversy over Donald Trump’s golf trip, is now up and being steered by Martin Pengelly. The city of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, conducted 1,146,156 nucleic acid tests – which are used to identify the virus – on 23 May, the local health authority has confirmed. This compares with 1,470,950 tests a day earlier. Wuhan began a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers – infected people who show no outward sign of illness – after confirming on 9-10 May its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since the city’s release from a virtual lockdown on 8 April. I’m back with you for the next couple of hours – do email nick.ames@theguardian.com or tweet @NickAmes82 if you’d like to get in touch. Underground production at AngloGold Ashanti’s Mponeng mine in South Africa will remain closed until further notice after 53 employees tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities have announced. The mine, the deepest in the world, restarted operations on 22 April after closing entirely during a nationwide lockdown, and was operating at 50% capacity. The department of health in Gauteng, the province where the mine is located, said on Twitter that 53 employees at the mine had so far tested positive for the virus, and that a further 104 tests were still being processed. “The management of the mine has indicated that the underground production will remain closed until further notice,” the statement said. The company did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment outside of business hours, Reuters reports. In the US, president Donald Trump is making headlines for his decision to spend Saturday playing at his golf course in Virginia. Public health experts, including the White House’s own Dr Deborah Birx, have said that golf is OK with social distancing and other measures observed. But Trump, not wearing a mask, was filmed shaking hands with a playing partner. You can read more about this from my colleagues in the US on their live blog: Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus-linked ban on gatherings of more than eight people. Police fired tear gas and water cannon at the pro-democracy protesters who gathered on Sunday in the most intense clashes for months, AFP reports. As the demonstrators and police were facing off in the semi-autonomous financial hub, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, insisted in Beijing that the proposed law must be imposed “without the slightest delay”. The planned legislation – expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition – comes after Hong Kong was shaken last year by months of massive, often-violent protests, and repeated warnings from Beijing that it would not tolerate dissent. With campaigners warning the proposal could spell the end of the city’s treasured freedoms, thousands gathered and chanted slogans in the busy Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts, while some masked protesters set up makeshift barricades to stop police vehicles. Vincent, a 25-year-old protester, told AFP: People may be criminalised only for words they say or publish opposing the government. I think Hong Kongers are very frustrated because we didn’t expect this to come so fast and so rough. But... we won’t be as naive as to believe that Beijing will simply sit back and do nothing. Things will only get worse here. At least 120 people were arrested, police said, as attempts to clear the roads in the area continued into the evening. In the UK, a former English Football Association chief executive has warned that clubs could face “insolvency” amid the pandemic. Former English Football Association chief executive Mark Palios has warned the cost of the coronavirus to lower-league clubs could be even larger than the £200m forecast by officials. Rick Parry, the chairman of the English Football League, which governs the three divisions below the Premier League, estimated the cost of lockdown earlier this month. But Palios, the chairman of third-tier Tranmere, believes the financial damage could be worse. Palios told Sky News: Whilst you may look at the ‘hole’ which has been articulated as £200m to September – I think it’s bigger than that. There is a real financial maelstrom coming towards the league at this point in time. I personally believe we haven’t seen the worst of it yet, and during the course of the summer you’ll see a lot more financial stress on the clubs as we move onwards and continue to pay wages. I think what you’ll see is a lot of clubs will stumble down the road to insolvency. Teams in third-division League One have still to agree on how to end their season, with Palios – whose club sit in the relegation zone – calling for relegation to be scrapped. “We don’t want to have a decision foisted upon us that is going to affect us financially,” said Palios. “Why would you … in terms of certain clubs, foist on them an even worse position?” Palios said the impact of the coronavirus meant EFL rules that hit insolvent clubs with points penalties should be relaxed. Although points deductions can be appealed against on the grounds of “force majeure” events, Palios also called for a clarification of rules regarding clubs which entered administration. “This is a consequence of a pandemic, so I think they need to be considering that clubs may need to go to the protection of administration,” he said. I’m taking a lunch break now but my colleague, Aaron Walawalkar, will steer you through the next hour or so. What do we now know about Covid-19 – and can you get it twice? Nicola Davis has answers to your questions, based on current knowledge and the latest research from scientists. Dominic Cummings, the under-fire adviser to Boris Johnson, has been seen entering 10 Downing Street. Significant? We don’t yet know, but our UK coronavirus blog will keep you firmly up to date as this story continues to pan out. The United States should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, rather than spreading lies and attacking the country, the Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi says. Sino-US ties have nosedived since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, with the administrations of president Donald Trump and president Xi Jinping repeatedly trading barbs over issues related to the pandemic, reports Reuters, especially US accusations of cover-ups and lack of transparency. The two top economies have also clashed over Hong Kong, human rights, trade and US support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan. State councillor Wang, speaking at his annual press conference on the sidelines of China’s parliament, expressed his deep sympathies to the United States for the pandemic, where the death toll is expected to surpass 100,000 in the coming days, the highest number of any country. “Regretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China,” said Wang, who is also China’s foreign minister. “Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and concocted too many lies about China and plotted too many conspiracies. I want to say here: Don’t waste precious time any longer, and don’t ignore lives. “What China and the United States need to do the most is to first learn from each other and share their experience in fighting against the epidemic, and help each country fight it.” In Germany, there are more football matches in the country’s top division – the Bundesliga – today. It restarted last week behind closed doors amid intense scrutiny and, thus far, things appear to have gone relatively smoothly. This picture, showing medics in protective suits checking the body temperature of a person about to enter Schalke 04’s stadium before their match with Augsburg, gives a flavour of the strict measures being taken to ensure it takes place safely. A British man has been detained in an Indian prison after being accused of breaching the country’s strict coronavirus lockdown rules, reports Nazia Parveen. Sohail Hughes, 29, had been on an extended holiday to visit family in the Gujarat region before undertaking a pilgrimage of mosques when he was detained last month. His family, who have a launched a petition to have him freed, have claimed he is being unlawfully held by Indian officials. Hughes’ sister, Aatika, said he was forced to take refuge in a mosque in Bhopal after being caught out by the swiftly implemented lockdown laws requiring people to stay off the streets. Aatika, 35, says her brother, alongside dozens of other men, had his passport seized before being kept in quarantine for more than a month inside a hostel. While in quarantine Hughes has been repeatedly tested for Covid-19 and has always been negative. Here is the full report: The key stories from the last few hours ... Conservative MPs are among those calling for Dominic Cummings, adviser to the UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to resign. Cummings is under fire from all ends of the political spectrum after the Guardian reported claims he breached government lockdown guidance on more than one occasion. Eid al-Fitr celebrations are under way across the world but there are concerns that a surge in Covid-19 cases could result. Festivities have been constrained in many places as a result of the pandemic. Russia has reported its highest daily Covid-19 death toll. The country recorded 153 coronavirus deaths over most recent 24-hour period measured, its highest daily toll during the pandemic, raising total fatalities to 3,541. Sweden has run the least-restrictive lockdown of any developed country but that strategy is coming under fire. Anneka Linde, the predecessor of the country’s state epidemiologist, has told the Observer that tougher measures should have been put in place earlier in the pandemic. The number of confirmed coronavirus case in Afghanistan has topped 10,000, while the Taliban has announced a ceasefire over Eid. Concerns are high as, despite the government-mandated lockdown, people continue to break the regulations. First indications of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine against coronavirus may be available in the autumn. That is according to the head of the GAVI vaccine alliance, Seth Berkley, who cautioned in a Swiss newspaper that it would be a long road from there to broad availability. If you are just joining today’s global coronavirus news blog, remember you can email me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or direct message me @NickAmes82 with any tips, feedback or observations. Your input is valued enormously. Meanwhile, in Spain, preparations are afoot for the next phase of lockdown loosening – but there are significant differences in vision between Madrid and Barcelona when it comes to bringing back the national staple of sitting on a terraza for food and drink. Stephen Burgen and Sam Jones have this report. Leaders of Italian towns and cities are struggling to get citizens to comply with social distancing rules after the reopening of bars led to group gatherings on streets and squares. Italians had some of their civil liberties restored last Monday alongside the reopening of bars, restaurants and all other retailers, and many have taken advantage of the fine weather to socialise outside or go to parks and beaches. But with the pandemic far from over, leaders of some towns and cities have had to reimpose restrictions following scenes of people mixing closely together and without face masks. In Brescia, one of the areas in Lombardy hardest hit by coronavirus, bars will now have to close by 9.30pm, while in Verona, in Veneto, bar customers must be seated at a table. Bars will also have to close by 9pm in Perugia, Umbria. According to police data, 20% more Italians ventured outside on Saturday compared with Friday, with a rise in the number of people using public transport. Six hundred and 51 fines were issued nationally on Friday, 10% of them in Rome. Two people infected with Covid-19 were charged for breaking the quarantine. Luciana Lamorgese, the interior minister, called for people to act more responsibly. “Before this reopening Italians demonstrated much responsibility, but today the difficulties with nightlife are arising: young people, after so long indoors, have lost their limits,” she said. “I hope the sense of responsibility returns and that they adapt to the new conditions as, more than ever, we need to stay attentive as going backwards would harm everyone.” People also flocked to Italy’s beaches over the weekend – at least those that have reopened. The civil protection authority reported 119 new deaths from coronavirus on Saturday and 669 new infections, of which 441 were in Lombardy. Today, Italians can celebrate mass in church with the community for the first time since 8 March. In this picture, chairs are sanitised before mass is celebrated by the parish priest Don Carlo Chiomento, of Candiolo near Turin. First indications of the effectiveness of a potential vaccine against coronavirus may be available in the autumn, the head of the GAVI vaccine alliance has told a Swiss newspaper, forecasting a long road from there to broad availability. “Unfortunately, we really do not know which vaccine will work and whether there will be one at all. If we’re lucky, we’ll receive indications in autumn as to [a potential vaccine’s] effectiveness,” the GAVI head Seth Berkley told NZZ am Sonntag in an interview published today. “But there will still be a long way to go from there until an approved active substance becomes available in large quantities for the global population.” Calling for globally coordinated efforts both to produce and share an eventual vaccine, Berkley said international agreement was needed to build up manufacturing capacity to rapidly produce a vaccine once one is found. “[Countries] should work together in order to share in each other’s vaccines in case one’s own are not good,” he said, adding it was possible some vaccines would work better for younger people and others for older age groups. He urged the World Health Organization to issue clear guidelines on a vaccine’s use and distribution to prevent a vaccine first being made available to the rich at the expense of the people most in need, Reuters reports. Should an effective vaccine become available in an initially limited supply, it should first be used to immunise health personnel, he said. The number of confirmed coronavirus case in Afghanistan has topped 10,000 amid continued surges of transmission in the capital, Kabul, and Herat – while the country woke up to a rare period of calm after recent violence. Around half of the tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive across the country. The health ministry tested 1,206 suspected patients, of whom 584 came out positive. Two patients also died overnight, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 10,582 and the death toll to 218. There have been 1,075 recoveries. Most of the new infections were reported in Kabul, with 324 cases coming back positive from 571 tests. Kabul is the country’s worst-affected area for transmissions, with 3,784 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. The eastern province of Nangarhar and western province of Herat, which have both seen surges in the number of new infections in recent days, recorded 135 new cases combined. Herat is the country’s worst-affected area for deaths, with 35 patients losing their lives to Covid-19. Sunday is the first day of Eid in Afghanistan and concerns are high as, despite the government-mandated lockdown, people continue to break the regulations. According to a Guardian tally, Afghanistan recorded 3,920 new cases in the seven days before Eid – a record high. Wahid Majroh, the country’s deputy health minister, warned the nation on Saturday that the “catastrophe” of coronavirus is spreading across the country and said the nation has only two options for Eid: “You either stay at home and safe, or go out to visit your relatives and friends – which [can] cause everyone in your family [to become] infected”. He said the ministry is concerned about people breaking lockdown rules. “When people were heeding, the daily number of infections was was just about 250 – but now, as the people continue to break the rules and we test more, the number is rising.” Majroh, who escaped an assassination attempt unharmed on Saturday, said the ministry is preparing more hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. Early last week, he said the country had run out of hospital beds for them in most areas. Meanwhile, Afghans woke up to a rare period of calm as the Taliban announced a ceasefire for the three days of Eid. Its leadership instructed fellow fighters to stop their “offensive operations against the enemy … and defend only if attacked”. The Taliban’s move is only second ceasefire in around 19 years of war; they made a similar announcement in 2018. “All Mujahedeen should be aware that nobody can go the enemy’s control areas and from the opposite side, nobody is allowed to get into Mujahedeen’s areas,” the Taliban said in a statement. The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, welcomed the move and said he has instructed Afghan forces to “comply with the three-day truce and to defend only if attacked”. Moving on to Indonesia, which has reported 21 new coronavirus deaths and 526 new infections in the most recent 24-hour count. That means the country has recorded 1,372 deaths and 22,271 infections. More daily Covid-19 figures are coming through from south-east Asia. Malaysia has reported 60 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total number of known infections to 7,245. The country’s health ministry said the number of fatalities remained unchanged at 115. Here is a very thought-provoking piece from Simon Tisdall, arguing that an age of revolution in the post-coronavirus world is inevitable – and the biggest question is what form it takes. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the pandemic “a wake-up call … for business and government to think, act and invest for the common good”. This sounds almost socialistic. A revolutionary agenda for the post-pandemic world also includes meaningful steps to address poverty and the north-south wealth gap, more urgent approaches to linked climate, energy, water and mass extinction crises and, for example, the adoption of so-called doughnut economics that measures prosperity by counting shared social, health and environmental benefits, not GDP growth. It may seem like pie in the sky. But so too did the idea of millions working from home, and halting road and air travel, until it happened almost overnight. Whether recognised as such or not, this is a revolutionary manifesto that, if it is pursued – as a growing body of opinion believes it must be – will demand the utter transformation of current political behaviour and organisation. The whole article is here, and well worth a few minutes of your time: Russia this morning reported 153 coronavirus deaths over the previous 24 hours, its highest daily toll during the pandemic, raising total fatalities to 3,541. The country’s coronavirus crisis response centre also said 8,599 new cases had been documented, a reduction of 835 on the previous day – pushing the nationwide tally of infections to 344,481. Sweden has run the least-restrictive lockdown of any developed country but, with its overall Covid-19 death toll expected to pass 4,000 this weekend, that strategy is coming under fire. Anneka Linde, the predecessor of the country’s state epidemiologist, has told the Observer that tougher restrictions should have been put in place earlier in the pandemic. Linde, who oversaw Sweden’s response to swine flu and Sars as state epidemiologist from 2005 to 2013, had until now expressed support for her country’s approach under her successor, Anders Tegnell. But she has now become the first member of the public health establishment to break ranks, saying she has changed her mind as a result of Sweden’s relatively high death toll compared with that of its neighbours, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. “I think that we needed more time for preparedness. If we had shut down very early … we would have been able, during that time, to make sure that we had what was necessary to protect the vulnerable,” Linde told the Observer. Here is the full story, from Richard Orange: Socially distanced Eid al-Fitr prayers are taking place across the world – as seen here at a mosque in Zagreb, Croatia. A 107-year-old Iranian woman who was infected with coronavirus has recovered, according to Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency. The woman, Saltanat Akbari, was admitted to the Khansari hospital in the central city of Arak. She was released from the hospital after spending “some time” in isolation. “She defeated the virus with the help of doctors and nurses at the hospital,” Fars said. Iran is one of the most affected countries in the Middle East with a total of 133,521 infected cases and 7,359 deaths. Our UK coronavirus live blog is now up, running and in the hands of Jedidajah Otte. It will be well worth keeping an eye on, as trailed two posts ago. Singapore has confirmed 548 more coronavirus cases, taking its tally to 31,616. The vast majority of the newly infected people are migrant workers living in dormitories, the health ministry said. Three are permanent residents. To date there have been 23 deaths from Covid-19 in the country. Just in case you missed it, the big story in the UK involves Dominic Cummings, the most senior adviser to prime minister Boris Johnson. Last night, we reported claims that, further to Friday evening’s exclusive that he breached lockdown rules, he has done so on other occasions. It is a story that will dominate the British news agenda today. Matthew Weaver’s piece is here: The festival of Eid al-Fitr, which ends the fasting month of Ramadan, began at dawn today. It is a time of joy and celebration, but there are concerns in the Middle East that those festivities could bring about a surge in coronavirus cases – so they have been constrained in many places. Michael Safi, in Amman, and Harriet Sherwood have reported this story for us. “It’s sad, it hurts,” said Mohammad, who runs a sugarcane juice stall. “Normally we’d wake up, take our kids to pray, and visit family and friends. It was cheerful, we felt joy.” This year? “We’ll eat, drink and sleep,” he said. “And we’ll hang around annoying our wives,” said his father, grinning behind him. Contact with family and friends is part of the festival. “We’ll visit them,” said Abdul Kareem, queuing outside a bakery. “But it’ll be on WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook.” The owner of a nearby shoe shop, Wissam, watched the bustle from his door. “This isn’t right,” he says of the busy scene. “There’s a virus out there.” Full story: Good morning, afternoon or evening, wherever you are. I’ll be taking you through the next eight hours, more or less, of live Covid-19 news and updates from around the world. As always, it would be good to hear from you. Send any news tips, observations, comments or feedback to nick.ames@theguardian.com, or by all means drop me a direct message on Twitter @NickAmes82. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks as always for following along. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses – but not Covid-19. The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were “pure fabrication”. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had “isolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses … But their highest similarity to Sars-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.” US opens up for summer. There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times filled the entire front page of Sunday’s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths. Argentina extends lockdown. Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city’s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began. Brazil cases near 350,000. Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the health ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world’s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America’s largest country still lags. New Zealand reports no new cases. New Zealand’s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country’s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths. Australian states ease restrictions. In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June. Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals “incredibly closely” because Belt and Road projects could “build up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm”. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative. French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started. French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other. Boris Johnson’s chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges. In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported seeing him making a fresh trip hundreds of miles to Durham. In Australia, a Darwin pub has been fined more than AU$5,000 (US$3,270) for repeatedly failing to adhere to strict coronavirus laws. Police and environmental health officers issued a caution to Lola’s Pergola on 15 May for failing to serve separate meals to people consuming liquor, patrons not being seated while drinking and social distancing not being implemented. One week later, further observations confirmed reports from concerned patrons that alcohol was being served without meals. Advice about the chief health officer’s directions was provided to the owner at the time. But the next day, the venue had to be cautioned again and the following day the infringement notice was issued. More than 11,000 compliance checks have been completed and 57 fines issued. UK low-income households denied coronavirus support by benefit cap Tens of thousands of poor households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government’s benefit cap. The number of low-income households affected by the cap in London has doubled since the crisis started, according to analysis seen by the Observer. Households already at the cap when the crisis hit have been missing out on £320 a month in additional support. For private renters with children, this is £532 a month. A further 22,000 households are now at the cap and are missing out on an average of £185 a month. It has led to an outcry that there is now a two-tier system, in which workers on the government’s furlough scheme have access to far more support than some of those reliant on welfare. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, is calling for the cap to be increased during the pandemic. The government introduced new help for those claiming universal credit, however, the cap was not increased or suspended.

The virology lab in Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, was working on three live strains of bat coronavirus, but none of them match the one that has caused the Covid-19 pandemic, its director has said. Wang Yanyi told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN that the closest genetic match to the virus spreading around the world was only 79.8%, adding that claims made by US president Donald Trump and others that the virus could have leaked from the facility were “pure fabrication”. She said: “Our institute first received the clinical sample of the unknown pneumonia on December 30 last year … We didn’t have any knowledge before that, nor had we ever encountered, researched or kept the virus. In fact, like everyone else, we didn’t even know the virus existed. How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?” The attempt by the laboratory to refute the claims is nevertheless likely to add more fuel to the conspiracy rumours. The interview came amid fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. The New York Times marked the looming threshold with a front page listing nearly 1,000 Covid-19 death notices, gleaned from hundreds of US papers. The headline spoke of an “incalculable loss”. Charities call for new youth corps to tackle UK virus jobs crisis A coalition of British youth charities is urging the government to back a “national youth corps” to create opportunities for school and university leavers facing the toughest labour market for decades. The alliance of 12 organisations argues that decisive intervention can “turn this looming disaster into an opportunity”. The new youth corps would guarantee at least the minimum wage for 16- to 25-year-olds in a range of work and training opportunities until the end of 2021. There have been at least nine separate shootings in the United States linked to conflicts over coronavirus public health restrictions, from mask-wearing to social distancing rules, according to The Trace, a nonprofit news outlet focused on gun violence. At least four people have died and seven have been wounded in the shootings, The Trace found, looking at data from the Gun Violence Archive, which assembles real-time data on shootings based on news reports. The coronavirus-linked incidents include arguments over mask-wearing on public transit and in businesses, including a man in Colorado who reportedly shot and wounded a Waffle House employee who confronted him over not wearing a mask, and a man in Texas who reportedly shot a bus passenger after being told he could not board the bus without a mask. Thailand on Sunday reported no new coronavirus cases and no new deaths, with a total of 3,040 confirmed cases and 56 fatalities since the outbreak began in January. Sunday was the fourth day in this month that there were no new daily cases, said Panprapa Yongtrakul, a spokeswoman for the government’s coronavirus task force. There are 2,921 patients who have recovered and returned home since the outbreak started. Verna Yu reports for the Guardian: In Hong Kong, small groups of activists and pro-democracy politicians have begun marching to China’s liaison office, arranging themselves in groups of eight in order not to breach the government’s social distancing rules. “A characteristic of a dictatorial country is that they use national security as a pretext to suppress freedom of speech,” Roy Tam, a district councillor shouted through a loud hailer. Eight activists from another group, League of Social Democrats, arrived to demonstrate in front of the office minutes later. “Hong Kong people defending our human rights,” they chanted. “Don’t forget the June 4 massacre! Human rights are higher than the regime! Down with Communist Party dictatorship!” You can read the full report here: Get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com.

Australian mining magnate Clive Palmer will lodge documents with the country’s high court this week, arguing Western Australia’s border closure is unconstitutional, as the state again recorded no new cases of Covid-19, AAP reports. Palmer wanted to visit WA for meetings with businesspeople, senator Mathias Cormann and potential 2021 state election candidates for his United Australia party, but was rejected due to coronavirus restrictions. “Closing down the border is not only an act of stupidity by WA premier Mark McGowan, but it is against the Australian constitution and I am confident the high court will see it that way as well,” Palmer said in a statement on Sunday. “The WA premier needs to act now to ensure a successful future beyond Covid-19 by opening his borders to allow trade and travel from Australian states into WA. It is a matter of national importance that the borders be open.” Palmer said he would lodge the legal documents on Monday and hoped to have a directions hearing in the high court by the end of the week. McGowan said on Friday that he endorsed the WA police commissioner’s decision not to grant Palmer an exemption from the travel ban. The premier has continued to insist WA’s interstate borders will remain closed for months, despite criticism from some, including NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. WA’s coronavirus tally remains at 560, including just two active cases. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has dismissed calls for his treasurer to face questioning before a Senate inquiry over the AU$60bn (US$39bn) reduction in the estimated cost of the government’s jobkeeper wage subsidy program. In a press conference, Morrison denied the revision - along with the new estimate only 3.5 million workers will be covered by the scheme, not 6.5 million - raised any issue with the government’s overall economic competence. He said when the Treasury had calculated its original estimate that the program would cost $130bn over six months, they were very uncertain economic times, and the government had moved very quickly to launch the scheme. “On the day it was a big gulp for the government to understand what we needed to do but we didn’t flinch. We knew this was necessary and we responded quickly. We made the estimates based on the best information we had available to us and that provided to be overly cautious.” He said there had been no loss to the taxpayer - “in fact it’s been the reverse”. Morrison said the move by Labor senator Katy Gallagher to call the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, to appear before the Senate Select Committee on Covid-19 was “a political stunt”. A government spokesperson said the arrangements for the Covid-19 committee were for ministers who served in the lower house to be represented by their Senate representative ministers, akin to Senate estimates hearings. Here are the most important developments in the pandemic in Australia so far today: Scott Morrison urges state leaders to justify economic damage from ongoing border restrictions. In Australia, Scott Morrison has urged several state leaders who are still maintaining domestic border restrictions to justify the potential economic damage. The prime minister did not go as far as some of his Coalition colleagues in calling for premiers such as Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland to swiftly lift border restrictions, but he emphasised that the national cabinet had never agreed to internal border closures and leaders should be accountable to their voters. Pompeo implies Belt and Road projects may threaten US info sharing with Australia. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be put at risk if the Australian state of Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals “incredibly closely” because Belt and Road projects could “build up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm”. Beauty salons to reopen in New South Wales from 1 June. State health minister, Brad Hazzard, has announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons will all be open from 1 June. “Of all of the requests I’ve had as health minister in the last three months, this has been the one that I think has topped the barrel ... I didn’t even know there was such a thing as acrylic nails, but I’m very pleased to say that they are now open,” Hazzard said. He said salon operators would have to have a Covid-safe plan and stick to physical distancing measures. Six million Australians download tracing app. Six million Australians have now downloaded the Covidsafe app, less than a month after it was launched to help health authorities trace coronavirus infections. In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in homes and outdoors as well as overnight stays in hotels from next month, AAP reports. Victoria will further ease restrictions by the end of May, as schools and some outdoor facilities go back to a new normal from Tuesday. The total number of coronavirus cases in Victoria is 1,603. Global cases pass 5.3 million. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 5,311,089 confirmed infections. At least 342,104 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Both figures are likely to be significantly higher, however, due to underreporting and differing definitions and testing rates. Wuhan lab had three live bat coronaviruses: Chinese state media. The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city where Covid-19 first emerged, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the new contagion wreaking chaos across the world, its director has said, AFP reports. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims made by US President Donald Trump and others the virus could have leaked from the facility were “pure fabrication”. Brazil cases near 350,000. Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the Health Ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world’s virus hot spot behind the United States. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America’s largest country still lags. US records 1,127 new deaths in 24 hours. The US has recorded 1,127 deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to AFP, citing Johns Hopkins figures.The current US total is 97,048, according to the Johns Hopkins Universitytracker. The US is likely to record 100,000 deaths before 1 June, the date at which the Centers for Disease Control predicted the country would mark that many deaths.The US toll is far higher than any other country. The UK, with the next worst number of deaths, has lost 36,757 lives. New York Times covers front page with 1,000 Covid-19 death notices. The New York Times has filled the entire front page of Sunday’s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country. The entire list, which continues inside, numbers nearly 1,000 names – a fraction of the total loss of life in the US during the outbreak so far. Argentina extends lockdown to 7 June. Argentina extended until 7 June a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires on Saturday and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city’s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days, Reuters reports. The coronavirus pandemic “appears to be taking a different pathway in Africa,” the World Health Organization said, after it took 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases and 3,100 deaths. “Case numbers have not grown at the same exponential rate as in other regions and so far Africa has not experienced the high mortality seen in some parts of the world,” the agency said. Downing Street is facing accusations of a cover-up over a 264-mile journey by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, at the height of the national lockdown. There were reports that No 10 knew Cummings had made the trip to Durham, a northern city, after developing coronavirus symptoms. New York’s daily death toll falls below 100 for first time since March, as Trump causes controversy with golfing trip. 84 deaths were recorded in New York – 62 in hospitals and 22 in nursing homes. It’s “still a tragedy”, said state governor, Andrew Cuomo, but the figure had been over 100 for the past five days, so this is a significant drop. Donald Trump teed up fresh controversy by leaving the White House for his golf course in Virginia. Secret Service agents accompanying the president were photographed wearing masks. Trump was not seen to cover his face. Zoos, reptile parks and aquariums across the state will reopen from 1 June, with some restrictions. New South Wales treasurer Dominic Perrottet: “[Taronga] zoo as we know employs hundreds of people here in Sydney, but also right across the state, aquariums and reptile parks employ many people. There are many mums and dads and kids who are animal lovers and I want them to enjoy these great institutions.” At Taronga and Western Plains zoo in Dubbo, physical distancing measures will apply, with tickets available online only, and a limited number of visitors at any one time. Shows, such as the seals and bird shows, will continue but must be pre-booked. There will be no live keeper talks or animal interactions, such as giraffe feeding. Taronga’s sky safari is closed. There will hand sanitiser stations throughout the zoo and the cafes will be takeaway only. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 5,311,089 confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide. At least 342,104 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Both figures are likely to be significantly higher, however, due to underreporting and differing definitions and testing rates. Conspiracy rumours that the biosafety lab was involved in the outbreak swirled online for months before Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought the theory into the mainstream by claiming that there is evidence the pathogen came from the institute, AFP reports. The lab has said it received samples of the then-unknown virus on 30 December, determined the viral genome sequence on 2 January and submitted information on the pathogen to the WHO on 11 January. Wang said in the interview that before it received samples in December, their team had never “encountered, researched or kept the virus.” “In fact, like everyone else, we didn’t even know the virus existed,” she said. “How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?” The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city where Covid-19 first emerged, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the new contagion wreaking chaos across the world, its director has said, AFP reports. Scientists think Covid-19 - which first emerged in Wuhan and has killed some 340,000 people worldwide - originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal. But the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims made by US President Donald Trump and others the virus could have leaked from the facility were “pure fabrication”. The attempt by the laboratory to refute the claims is likely to add more fuel to the conspiracy rumours promoted by Trump and others. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre has “isolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats.” “Now we have three strains of live viruses... But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%,” she said, referring to the coronavirus strain that causes Covid-19. One of their research teams, led by Professor Shi Zhengli, has been researching bat coronaviruses since 2004 and focused on the “source tracing of SARS”, the strain behind another virus outbreak nearly two decades ago. In Australia, Scott Morrison has urged several state leaders who are still maintaining domestic border restrictions to justify the potential economic damage. The prime minister did not go as far as some of his Coalition colleagues in calling for premiers such as Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland swiftly lift border restrictions, but he emphasised that the national cabinet had never agreed to internal border closures, and leaders should be accountable to their voters. Morrison said border restrictions were in place in some form in Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, but he said this was never part of the national health panel’s advice. “The states and territories where they’re making those unilateral decisions, they are accountable to the people in their own states for those decisions, and justifying why they need to be there, and the health protection they believe it may offer and indeed the economic damage that it can create. So it is very much an onus on those premiers to be able to justify those decisions, which was not a decision of the national cabinet, as to why that is the right thing to do for those states.” Morrison said the focus now needed to be on creating as many jobs as possible and “I’d be urging all premiers to do just that.” France’s mosques nevertheless called on Muslims to stay at home to mark the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. They said they would gradually resume services from 3 June. France’s Jewish community took a similarly cautious line. Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia stressed that believers should not “rush towards the reopening of the synagogues”. The latest figures for those seriously ill from the virus fell Saturday, with 1,665 patients still in intensive care for the coronavirus: 36 fewer than 24 hours ago. But the government has had to fight a series of legal and battles to control the pace of the gradual loosening of France’s two-month lockdown. It has refused Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo’s call to reopen the capital’s parks and gardens, over fears this could accelerate infections in the city, already hard-hit by the virus. Heavily criticised for what critics say was their inadequate preparation in the run-up to the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have taken a cautious line in handling the exit from the lockdown. Many of its experts judge that it is too soon to say that the virus has been brought under control in France. French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened – provided proper precautions were taken, AFP reports. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Last Monday, the France’s Council of State, which instructs the government on legal issues, ordered it to lift its sweeping ban on all religious services, in place since the lockdown. The ruling said that such a ban on freedom of worship caused “damage that is serious and manifestly illegal”, ordering the government to lift the ban within eight days. But priests, pastors, rabbis and imams will still have to ensure that the correct safety measures are in force. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other. “My cell phone is crackling with messages!” Father Pierre Amar, a priest in Versailles, told AFP. At one church in Neuilly-sur-Seine, just outside Paris, some worshippers turned up at short notice on Saturday morning, having heard that mass would be celebrated. “We knew 30 minutes in advance, we ran to come,” said Eliane Nsom, who went with her three daughters. Around 40 people attended the service. More on Australia’s Covidsafe app, which has been downloaded by 6 million people. But is it actually useful? Nearly a month since launch, the contact tracing app has barely been used – just one person has been reported to have been identified using data from it. It set a target of 40% of the Australian population using the app for it to be effective. While close to 6 million Australians now have the app, the number of new downloads has declined in the past few weeks. No actual number was tied to the 40% figure, but based on estimations of the number of Australians with smartphones, it is now about 1.5m under that target. And the language from public officials has been toned down. No longer is it the key to freedoms, but an add-on to existing contact tracing methods, to work in concert with social distancing rules and continued testing to keep a lid on outbreaks. So how did it go from being the key to allowing Australians to get back to the footy to being barely relevant? In Australia, New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard also said a secondary school student in NSW may have tested positive to Covid-19. He said the student went back to school on Tuesday and on Wednesday developed mild symptoms and got tested. He said the student was now well and further information would be announced later. He warned that there is “no room for complacency” as numbers of new Covid-19 infections in the state remain low. “If you have the slightest sore throat, itchy throat, temperature, cough, a cold, runny nose, go and get tested. You may be saving yourself but you may be saving your family and others in the community.” He said while there may be a temptation in the winter period to dismiss cold and flu-like symptoms, people should not. “No, it is winter and Covid-19 season, so go and get tested,” he said. Back to Australia now: New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, has announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons will all be open from 1 June. “Of all of the requests I’ve had as health minister in the last three months, this has been the one that I think has topped the barrel ... I’ve even had text messages in the middle of the other meetings, telling me how bad acrylic nails were. I didn’t even know there was such a thing as acrylic nails, but I’m very pleased to say that they are now open,” Hazzard said. He said salon operators would have to have a Covid-safe plan and stick to physical distancing measures. US president Donald Trump is tweeting about hydroxychloroquine again: Here is a recent article about the dangers of the drug by my colleage Sarah Boseley, the Guardian’s health editor: Hydroxychloroquine: Trump’s Covid-19 ‘cure’ increases deaths, global study finds Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug Donald Trump is taking to prevent Covid-19, has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world, a study has shown. A major study of the way hydroxychloroquine and its older version, chloroquine, have been used on six continents – without clinical trials – reveals a sobering picture. Scientists said the results meant the drug should no longer be given to Covid-19 patients except in proper research settings: The China Daily reports that there have been three new coronavirus cases in China in the last 24 hours. The day before, China recorded no new confirmed cases for the first time since the outbreak began. Beijing’s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said. More from that interview with Mike Pompeo: He said every nation had a sovereign right to make decisions for itself and Victoria also had “some rights” but he added that BRI projects needed to be looked at closely. Some projects “may just be straight-up commercial transactions” and that would be “fine”, but nearly every one had costs and risks attached to it. Pompeo said the US would do the right thing to defend and keep America safe and work with “great partners like Australia”. He added, however, that the US “will not take any risk to our telecommunications infrastructure, any risk to the national security elements of what we need to do with our Five Eyes partners”. We’re going to protect and preserve the security of those institutions, so I don’t know the nature of those projects precisely, but to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect, we will simply separate. We’re going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and partners and allies across the world, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, will do the same.” The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be put at risk if the Australian state of Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals “incredibly closely” because Belt and Road projects could “build up the capacity of the Chinese Communist Party to do harm”. The Victorian state government has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement with Beijing that would allow for cooperation under President Xi Jinping’s signature infrastructure program known as the Belt and Road Initiative. But that deal is still in its early stages with no projects locked in, and the state government has promised to “consider both Victoria’s and the national interest before agreeing to any specific activity”. The New York Times has filled the entire front page of Sunday’s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country. The US death toll stands at more than 97,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, by far the highest in the world, and the Times said it had been considering how to mark expected milestone of 100,000 deaths. The entire list, which continues inside, numbers nearly 1,000 names – a fraction of the total loss of life in the US during the outbreak so far. In an article for Times Insider, assistant graphics editor Simone Landon explained the treatment was a way of personalising the tragedy as readers and staff developed data fatigue from the constant reporting of the pandemic. Landon led a team of researchers in searching obituaries in hundreds of US newspapers that listed Covid-19 as the cause of death and extracting names and key personal details “that depicted the uniqueness of each life lost”, such as: “Alan Lund, 81, Washington, conductor with ‘the most amazing ear”. Tom Bodkin, its chief creative officer, said the all-text treatment referenced early newspaper designs, but that he could not remember another front page without an image in his 40 years at the paper. “This is certainly a first in modern times,” Bodkin said.

New York Stock Exchange traders hope to prove they are still a big noise A line from the 1983 movie Trading Places is being used to trail the partial return to open outcry trading on the New York Stock Exchange this week, after the physical floor (but not the electronic market) was closed in March as part of the coronavirus lockdown. “We’re back, Mortimer,” was how veteran floor trader Peter “Einstein of Wall Street” Tuchman put it. Tuchman, who is sometimes called the “most photographed trader on Wall Street”, is recovering from a nasty bout of the virus himself, so it is difficult to begrudge him his enthusiasm. But is this week’s return of open outcry trading at the NYSE – where safety concerns will only permit about 25% of the normal numbers of brokers back – really such a big deal? Mexican health authorities registered 3,329 new cases of the novel coronavirus in the country and 190 new deaths, a health official said on Saturday, bringing the total number to 65,856 cases and 7,179 deaths. Argentina extended until 7 June a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires on Saturday and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city’s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days, Reuters reports. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases, President Alberto Fernandez said in a televised press conference. Commercial activity in some of the city’s more populated neighbourhoods and access to public transportation will also be rolled back. Some businesses had been allowed to reopen under a previous lockdown extension. The lockdown, due to expire on Sunday, has been in place since March 20, though officials have relaxed restrictions in some areas of the country. Argentina has a commercial flight ban until September 1, one of the world’s strictest travel measures during the pandemic. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began. The country has 11,353 cases, mostly in Buenos Aires, where the city’s low-income neighbourhoods have been particularly hard hit, government data showed. The death toll is at 445. Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the Health Ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world’s virus hot spot behind the United States. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America’s largest country still lags. Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has been fiercely criticized for his handling of the outbreak, which has led to the exit of two health ministers amid his insistence in opposing social distancing measures while advocating the use of unproven drugs for treatment. The former army captain has seen his opinion poll ratings drop as an unfolding political crisis adds to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand’s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub: There are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered. The total number of confirmed cases remains 1,154, and the total – including probable – at 1504. There are no new deaths to report, so the death toll remains at 21. One person remains in hospital – they are not in ICU. There have been another 3,302 tests completed, for a total of 259,152. Staying with the latest from Australia for a moment, the opposition is urging the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to call Donald Trump to clarify whether Australian exporters are being disadvantaged by the US-China trade deal. Growing trade tensions with China have been one of the biggest concerns in Australian political and business circles over the last couple of weeks, as Beijing has imposed tariffs of around 80% on Australian barley imports and suspended beef imports from four abattoirs on technical grounds. China announced recently it would immediately allow barley imports from the US, which was seen as a measure to meet commitments in the first phase of Xi’s trade deal with Trump. In January, China pledged to buy an extra $US200bn of American farm products and other goods and services over two years. The moves come after China railed against Australia for early and vocal calls for an independent inquiry into the origins and handling of coronavirus - a watered down version of which won broad support at last week’s World Health Assembly, including from Beijing. Penny Wong, the Labor opposition’s foreign affairs spokesperson, said it would have been better for the government to have followed “the usual diplomatic practice” of trying to secure some support from other countries before publicly announcing the inquiry push. But in an interview with the ABC’s Insiders program this morning, she also called on Morrison to check in with Trump “to ensure that our interests are not affected and not undermined by that [trade] deal between President Trump and President Xi [Jinping]”. Wong said: “Scott Morrison is always very keen to tell us when he has spoken to President Trump. Well, I think it is time for him to pick up the phone and speak to him now and ensure that the US-China trade deal does not come at the expense of Australian exporters and Australian jobs.” In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in homes and outdoors as well as overnight stays in hotels from next month, AAP reports. Victoria will further ease restrictions by the end of May, as schools and some outdoor facilities go back to a new normal from Tuesday. The total number of coronavirus cases in Victoria is 1,603 – a net increase of one since yesterday – two new cases were confirmed, according to the state’s health department, but a duplicate case was removed from the total, too. There were no new deaths, which leaves the total for the state at 19. The state will loosen its grip on social distancing restrictions from 1 June, allowing gatherings of up to 20 people at homes and outdoors, overnight stays in hotels as well as the opening of campgrounds. Twenty people will be allowed at weddings, while up to 50 people will be able to attend funerals. The same number of people, 20, will be able to visit libraries and other community facilities, entertainment and cultural venues, as well as beauty and personal care services. The US has recorded 1,127 deaths from coronavirus in the last 24 hours, according to AFP, citing Johns Hopkins figures. The current US total is 97,048, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US is likely to record 100,000 deaths before 1 June, the date at which the Centers for Disease Control predicted the country would mark that many deaths. The US toll is far higher than any other country. The UK, with the next worst number of deaths, has lost 36,757 lives. More on the wage subsidy scheme in Australia. So far, the government has not given any indication it is planning to extend the scheme to excluded workers, such as casuals employed for less than a year, university and local government staff, temporary visa holders and employees of foreign-owned companies. However, a scheduled review in June may look at tweaks to the scheme, including the potential to extend targeted support to the worst-affected sectors beyond the expiry in September. The government has been spinning the updated figures as good news. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky News this morning that the original forecast was never “an objective or a target”. “It does mean that we’re in a better position as we work our way towards recovery and that is fantastic news,” Taylor said, adding that “we’ll see what comes out of” the review in June. In Australia, the government is facing sustained pressure to widen its wage subsidy scheme to cover a broader group of workers, after revelations on Friday that the six-month “jobkeeper” program is now expected to cost the budget AU$70bn (US$46bn) rather than AU$130bn. The Labor opposition’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, described the news as “a $60bn black hole in the economic credibility of the Morrison government” and she reinforced calls for the $1500 fortnightly payment to be extended to a more of the workforce, including short-term casuals. Speaking on the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday morning, Wong said the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, should have “the courage” to accept a forthcoming invitation to appear before the Senate’s Covid-19 inquiry to explain the error. “We’d say to Josh, when you’ve got a budget blunder of this size, I reckon it is about time you fronted up and explained it.” The Guardian’s Amanda Holpuch and Nina Lakhani report from New York, with Khushbu Shah in Atlanta: In case you missed this story: In the US, Monday is Memorial Day – the traditional start of the American summer. Shutters are going up, doors are being unlocked, barriers removed. Every state is relaxing quarantine rules to some extent, betting that the country finally has Covid-19 under control. There are signs that for some Americans quarantine fatigue is overcoming fear of infection. With the economy reeling, others have dismissed the pandemic as a political plot – for them relaxing quarantine rules can’t come soon enough. But people on the front line are worried, and experts warn the outbreak has proved a “trust-destroying disaster” that could have devastating consequences. On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said new localized outbreaks were “inevitable” as mitigation measures are relaxed. He said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures – testing, quarantine and contact tracing – continued to be adhered to. Fauci said he was hopeful that the US would be ready, though a recent study by Harvard University found that only nine states were conducting, or near to conducting, the minimum recommended testing. Hours after Fauci spoke, Donald Trump ignored health guidance and ordered houses of worship to open for in-person services at the weekend. These disparate responses to the pandemic are not just happening in the White House, but across America. Six million Australians have now downloaded the COVIDSafe app, less than a month after it was launched to help health authorities trace coronavirus infections, AAP reports. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the app is playing a significant role in Australia’s response to the pandemic and several countries have expressed interest in learning from its positive impacts. “Australia continues to be a world leader in testing, tracing, and containing the coronavirus and I would encourage all Australians to contribute to that effort and download the COVIDSafe app today,” Mr Hunt said in a statement on Sunday. Only state and territory health officials have access to contact information from the app which is triggered when people come in close contact with someone who has the virus - that is 1.5 metres or less for a duration of 15 minutes or more. Government Services Minister Stuart Robert said the take up of the COVIDSafe app was downloaded faster than any other Australian government app and has consistently remained in the top three apps in Australian app stores. “Millions of Australians are doing their bit as part of our health response,” he said.

In Australia, 6 million people have downloaded the government’s COVIDSafe tracing app in under a month. The app is able to tell when a person has come into close contact - 1.5m - of an infected person (or a person later found to be infected) for 15 minutes and more, allowing authorities to contact people who may have been exposed to the virus. Meanwhile in the US, experts and frontline workers fear the country is not ready to ease restrictions for the summer – and warn there could be a disastrous second wave of infections. On Friday, White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci said a full-blown second wave could be avoided if the holy grail of containment measures – testing, quarantine and contact tracing – continued to be adhered to. Global deaths pass 340,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, at least 340,805 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. There are 5,288,392 confirmed infections. Both figures are likely to be significantly higher, however, due to underreporting and differing definitions and testing rates. The coronavirus pandemic “appears to be taking a different pathway in Africa,” the World Health Organization said, after it took 14 weeks for the continent to reach 100,000 cases and 3,100 deaths. “Case numbers have not grown at the same exponential rate as in other regions and so far Africa has not experienced the high mortality seen in some parts of the world,” the agency said. Downing Street is facing accusations of a cover-up over a 264-mile journey by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, at the height of the national lockdown. There were reports that No 10 knew Cummings had made the trip to Durham, a northern city, after developing coronavirus symptoms. New York’s daily death toll falls below 100 for first time since March, as Trump causes controversy with golfing trip. 84 deaths were recorded in New York – 62 in hospitals and 22 in nursing homes. It’s “still a tragedy”, said state governor, Andrew Cuomo, but the figure had been over 100 for the past five days, so this is a significant drop. Donald Trump teed up fresh controversy by leaving the White House for his golf course in Virginia. Early on a fine morning in Washington DC, the president was seen by reporters “in his typical golf wear of white polo shirt and white baseball cap … before he departed the White House” for an undisclosed location. Secret Service agents accompanying the president were photographed wearing masks. Trump was not seen to cover his face. He later arrived at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, where he was pictured playing a round.

However, unlike in Britain, visitors will be asked to voluntarily self-quarantine at home. Spain will reopen to overseas tourists from July, the prime minister announced on Saturday afternoon, adding that the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals as the country emerges from one of Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns. The prime minister said central and regional governments had been planning and coordinating the return to tourism for weeks.

Thailand has begun testing a coronavirus vaccine on monkeys after a positive trial in mice, the country’s minister of higher education, science and research and innovation has said.Suvit Maesincee said researchers hoped to have a “clearer outcome” of the effectiveness of the vaccine by September. China has recorded no new confirmed cases for the first time since the outbreak began. Beijing’s National Health Commission said on Saturday there were only two suspected cases in mainland China: in Shanghai and in the north-eastern Jilin province. New asymptomatic cases fell to 28, from 35 a day earlier, it said.

But the prime minister said he was “sceptical” about whether Australia would ever build its own nuclear power stations to provide electricity to domestic customers, given the country had plentiful access to coal, gas, wind and solar sources. Turnbull made the observations in a radio interview on Wednesday, a day after he named Dr Alan Finkel, a vocal advocate of nuclear power and the outgoing chancellor of Monash University, as Australia’s next chief scientist. He was asked to weigh in on the issue during a visit to South Australia, where the state Labor government has launched a royal commission into options for participation in the nuclear fuel cycle. Turnbull praised the premier, Jay Weatherill, for setting up the inquiry. “I was just talking about this with the cook in the cafe downstairs, when I was having some coffee and breakfast with Steve Marshall [the SA Liberal leader],” he told Adelaide radio station FiveAA. “As Brett, the chef, was saying, and I think a lot of South Australians feel like this and it’s a perfectly reasonable view: we’ve got the uranium [and] we mine it; why don’t we process it, turn it into the fuel rods, lease them to people overseas; when they’re done, bring them back – and we’ve got very stable geology in remote locations and a stable political environment – and store them? “That is a business that you could well imagine here.” Turnbull was less confident about the possibility of a domestic nuclear power industry. “Would we ever have a nuclear power station in Australia, or like the French do, dozens of nuclear power stations? I would be a bit sceptical about that,” he said. “I’m not talking about the politics. We’ve got so much other affordable sources of energy, not just fossil fuel like coal and gas but also wind, solar. The ability to store energy is getting better all the time, and that’s very important for intermittent sources of energy, particularly wind and solar. But playing that part in the nuclear fuel cycle I think is something that is worth looking at closely.” Turnbull was environment minister in the Howard government, which commissioned a study into the feasibility of nuclear power by a task force led by the former Telstra chief, Ziggy Switkowski, who is now chairman of NBN Co. The 2006 report suggested that up to 25 nuclear reactors could be built in Australia, producing a third of the country’s electricity by 2050. But it also found nuclear power would be much more expensive to produce than coal-fired power if a price was not put on carbon dioxide emissions. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said on Wednesday that the cost of setting up a nuclear industry from scratch was expensive. Shorten said it would be interesting to see what the South Australian royal commission proposed. “All the research and data I have seen is if you are going to start with a nuclear industry, that decision should have been made decades ago,” he said. Shorten instead called for an emphasis on renewable energy sources, which he said provided “exciting prospects for an energy revolution in Australia which generates jobs, investment and a cleaner environment”. “I don’t want Australia to miss the technological and economic opportunities of embracing climate change and renewable energy,” he said. “Labor is the only party who has proposed that 50% of our energy mix by 2030 should be powered from renewable energy. I am excited by the opportunities of battery storage, I am excited by the ability to expand solar power into small businesses.” The Australian Conservation Foundation described Turnbull’s comments as “ill-considered” and warned that radioactive waste was “a complex and contested policy area”. “Radioactive waste presents serious environment, security and public health challenges – and it lasts a lot longer than any politician’s tenure,” said Dave Sweeney, a foundation campaigner. Greenpeace dismissed nuclear power as “an expensive distraction from the real solutions to climate change, like solar and wind power”. “It leaves a legacy of radioactive waste which remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years,” said Emma Gibson, head of program for Greenpeace Australia Pacific. “We only have to look at the Fukushima disaster in Japan to be reminded of the health, social and economic impacts of a nuclear accident, and to see that this is not a safe option for Australians.” Turnbull is seeking to bolster the Liberal party’s popularity in South Australia, where the government suffered political difficulties after his predecessor, Tony Abbott, backed away from a pre-election promise to build 12 submarines locally. During his visit to the state on Wednesday, Turnbull sought to avoid specific commitments on the future submarine contract, but pointed to the government’s “competitive evaluation process” to resolve the issue. He also sought to counter the challenge from the South Australian senator Nick Xenophon, whose fledgling political party is promising to contest key seats. Turnbull told local ABC radio that the candidates might be very different from Xenophon. The prime minister faced questions about tax reform as a result of his repeated statements that all options remain on the table. Asked if he would only increase the goods and services tax if it was part of a suite of measures, such as the abolition of state states, Turnbull said: “It certainly has to be part of a suite of measures. No one, I think, is seriously suggesting doing it in isolation.” Turnbull said the GST had to be considered in a broader context. “That involves what you’re doing with inefficient state taxes, what you’re doing with the states exploiting their own tax bases, what you’re doing about improving efficiencies,” he told FiveAA. “You can’t just treat the commonwealth government as an ATM because everybody has got to improve the way they’re delivering services.” The stark message to state premiers and territory chief ministers builds on remarks Turnbull made to Guardian Australia last week. “A state government can’t say: ‘Nothing to see here, give us more money’,” he said on Friday. Shorten said the prime minister wanted to tell the states how to run the states. The Labor leader said Turnbull should focus on fixing the unfairness in the tax system, including superannuation concessions favouring high income earners. “I believe Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberals have an undeclared plan to put a GST on everything and to increase the cost of the GST,” Shorten said. “I represent working people in this country, people who can’t afford to pay more taxes.” Shorten said while Turnbull had floated lots of ideas since taking over the Liberal leadership, the government’s next budget would be “a test of the Liberal thought-bubble machine”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/29/from-feast-to-farce-how-the-big-hinkley-point-c-party-and-project-got-put-on-ice","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T17:59:11Z","webTitle":"From feast to farce: how the big Hinkley Point C party was put on ice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/from-feast-to-farce-how-the-big-hinkley-point-c-party-and-project-got-put-on-ice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/from-feast-to-farce-how-the-big-hinkley-point-c-party-and-project-got-put-on-ice","fields":{"headline":"From feast to farce: how the big Hinkley Point C party was put on ice","bodyText":"It was the lunch that never was. Cantonese-style pork crackling, Somerset brie and mackerel ceviche with creme fraiche were all on the menu for the 150 VIPs invited to Hinkley Point on Friday. The guests were due to celebrate a third nuclear power station at the site finally being approved. In keeping with the rest of the decade-long battle to build Hinkley Point C, however, the celebrations did not go as scheduled. By Friday morning the marquee was being packed away and the guests were nowhere to be seen. The menu had the distinctive flavours of the West Country, France and China to it to reflect the interests coming together to deliver the power plant. EDF, the French energy company, is building the new nuclear plant in Somerset with financial support from China General Nuclear Power Corporation. Planning for the party began a week ago, when EDF announced that it would make a final decision on whether to go ahead with the controversial £18bn project at a board meeting on 28 July. The French company had not been expected to make a decision until later in the year, so the announcement was a surprise. After 10 years of debate about the cost, safety and quality of the Hinkley Point C project, the final stretch looked to be in sight. EDF received another boost on Wednesday when shareholders agreed to buy €4bn (£3.4bn) of new shares in the company, providing another tranche of funding for Hinkley Point C. The agreement involved the French government, which owns 85% of EDF, buying €3bn of shares. By then, however, the Hinkley Point party was already in trouble. When Theresa May met François Hollande last week Britain’s prime minister told the French president that she would like to review the project herself. David Cameron and George Osborne had been enthusiastic cheerleaders. On Wednesday night May called Hollande again to confirm the government’s new timetable. Despite the French government being the biggest shareholder in EDF, it appears the 18 members of the company’s board headed for the crucial vote on Thursday afternoon with no knowledge of May’s rethink. Before the board meeting, the saga took another twist. An EDF director opposed to the new nuclear plant resigned and said he would not attend the meeting. Gérard Magnin said the project was “very risky” in his resignation letter. His departure followed that of EDF’s chief financial official, Thomas Piquemal, earlier this year, which was also linked to concerns about the cost of Hinkley Point C Magnin has a background in alternative energies and is the founder of Energy Cities, an association designed to help local authorities move towards newer forms of energy. He said in his letter that he was concerned about EDF’s strategic direction and its growing reliance on nuclear. Magnin’s resignation suggested that EDF was about to approve Hinkley Point C, and so it turned out. At around 6.30pm UK time on Thursday, news emerged that the remaining EDF directors had approved the project by just 10 votes to seven. EDF hailed the news in a statement, calling Hinkley Point C a “unique asset for French and British industries”. Two hours later, however, the UK government made a more sombre announcement. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial secretary, said: “The government will now consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.” This was not what EDF was expecting. It had been preparing to sign the contracts to start Hinkley Point C with the government and its Chinese partners on Friday. It swiftly cancelled plans to hold media interviews with Vincent de Rivaz, the boss of its UK arm, and for the celebratory lunch with VIP guests. A delegation from China that had flown over for the signing of the documents realised the trip had been in vain. Jean-Bernard Lévy, EDF’s chief executive, did not know about the delay until he left an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, which was meant to celebrate the company’s decision to build Hinkley Point C. Lévy is understood to have read the UK government statement on the internet. There could still be a celebratory lunch in the autumn if May’s government approves the project, but the hangover from the lunch-that-never-was could be painful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/14/toshiba-fuels-crisis-fears-delays-earnings-writedown-nuclear-westinghouse","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"Toshiba fuels fear of crisis after delaying earnings report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/toshiba-fuels-crisis-fears-delays-earnings-writedown-nuclear-westinghouse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/feb/14/toshiba-fuels-crisis-fears-delays-earnings-writedown-nuclear-westinghouse","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba fuels fear of crisis after delaying earnings report","bodyText":"Toshiba has unexpectedly delayed the release of a key earnings report and details of its rumoured withdrawal from overseas nuclear projects – including one in the UK – amid reports that it could suffer net losses of 500 billion yen ($4.4bn). The delay sent shares in the Japanese conglomerate down by 8% in Tokyo, and added to speculation that its financial problems could become an existential crisis. Toshiba’s chairman, Shigenori Shiga, is to resign to take responsibility for the massive writedown looming over its troubled US nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric, according to Japan’s public broadcaster NHK. Shiga, whose resignation was expected, is a former chairman of Westinghouse. Toshiba was scheduled to release details of its writedown of Westinghouse on Tuesday afternoon, followed by a press conference by its president, Satoshi Tsunakawa. But in a brief statement, the company said it was “not ready” to release the report, a delay some have interpreted as a sign that the company is in even deeper financial trouble than it has previously reported. Toshiba later said it had asked regulators to allow it to delay the release of its earnings and details of the nuclear writedown by a month while it investigates possible managerial wrongdoing at Westinghouse. Tsunakawa signalled this month that new nuclear projects would be reviewed in response to the anticipated multibillion-dollar writedown related to the purchase of a nuclear construction and services business by Westinghouse. The company was expected to confirm on Tuesday that it is withdrawing from new nuclear projects outside Japan, dealing a blow to plans for the planned power station at Moorside in Cumbria. Westinghouse, Toshiba’s US-based nuclear developer, produces the AP1000 reactors that were to be used at the £10bn station at Moorside, near Sellafield. Toshiba also has a 60% stake in NuGen, the company that was to build the Moorside facility. Toshiba is rumoured to have approached Korea Electric Power as a potential buyer for its stake in NuGen, according to the Nikkei business paper. The construction of a new nuclear station in the UK had carried hopes of creating thousands of jobs and boosting the country’s energy security. Instead, Toshiba’s withdrawal from the UK nuclear power market would leave a gaping hole in the British government’s nuclear strategy, said Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary. “The government’s energy policy is in chaos. We have become increasingly reliant on the decisions of foreign companies whose interests lie with their owners and not British consumers,” Long-Bailey said. “If Toshiba pulls out … the government must intervene immediately and provide public support and financial stability for Moorside and the community of west Cumbria. “That means taking a public stake in exchange for public support to protect energy supplies and jobs. Labour backs new nuclear and an expansion of renewable energy to keep the lights on and meet our climate change targets.” Hours before Toshiba cancelled its earnings announcement for April-December, the Nikkei said the company was preparing to warn that it may not be able to continue as a “going concern” as a result of massive losses linked to Westinghouse and doubts about its restructuring plans, but did not provide details. “The delay shows that the company is in a mess,” said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management. “We can assume that the company is not delaying its earnings release for good news. The market speculates that Toshiba will be releasing figures worse than what is being reported already.” The delay follows growing expectations that the charge for the writedown in its US nuclear business could be as high as 700bn yen ($6.2bn) – enough to wipe out the group’s shareholder equity. During the past few decades, Toshiba has been wholly or partly involved in the construction of 20 nuclear reactors in Japan, none of which is currently operating following the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011. Westinghouse has built 91 reactors around the world, of which 67 are still operating, 12 are closed and four are in long-term outage. Toshiba’s withdrawal from the Moorside project “will see all parties with a vested interest running to the government in a desperate bid to secure billions in taxpayers’ funding”, said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany. “Decades ago the nuclear industry moved into a post-fact world – unforgivably, successive governments and opposition parties have been willing accomplices. But as the Toshiba meltdown shows, eventually reality catches up with you.” If Toshiba’s liabilities exceed its assets at the end of the current fiscal year, it will be demoted to the second section of the Tokyo stock exchange, a move that could make it harder to secure money from banks and other lenders. The conglomerate, whose portfolio ranges from construction to consumer electronics, plans to generate funds by selling off its profitable flash memory business. Toshiba, which employs 190,000 people, twice delayed planned earnings releases in 2015 as it reeled from a $1.3bn accounting scandal. Fallout from the scandal contributed to a group net loss last year of ‎479.4bn yen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/15/bridgwater-business-toasts-hinkley-point-c-go-ahead-somerset","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T16:21:13Z","webTitle":"'It puts us on the map': Bridgwater business toasts Hinkley Point C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/bridgwater-business-toasts-hinkley-point-c-go-ahead-somerset","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/bridgwater-business-toasts-hinkley-point-c-go-ahead-somerset","fields":{"headline":"'It puts us on the map': Bridgwater business toasts Hinkley Point C","bodyText":"Malcolm Pyne, butcher and entrepreneur, cracked open a bottle of bubbly at his store and takeaway in Bridgwater to celebrate the announcement. “This is fabulous news for the town and for Somerset. It really puts us on the map. I feel a bit tingly to be honest. We’ve been here before, thinking it’s going to happen but it really looks like this is it now. The lady [Theresa May] has spoken.” Pyne and his wife, Julie, took a risk when proposals for a new power station at Hinkley Point emerged nearly a decade ago, and expanded from a high street shop into their current out-of-town store close to the M5, judging that north Somerset was set for a boom. They already supply local beef, pork and lamb to the existing site and are building a new meat-producing plant to cope with the extra demand Hinkley Point C will create. “We’ll also be increasing our staff from 40 to 60,” said Pyne. “Hinkley provides fantastic business opportunities.” The government’s announcement was largely welcomed on Thursday by Somerset council leaders, business bosses, schools and colleges. EDF says that over the 10 years of construction, 25,000 new “employment opportunities” will be created and at the peak there will be 5,600 people working at the site. It estimates that at any one time 900 people will be employed at Hinkley Point C during its 60 years of operation. It has been at pains to claim that wherever possible it will use local people and companies to build and operate the plant. Duncan McGinty, the Conservative leader of Sedgemoor district council, said many of the new jobs would be well-paid and rewarding. “Hinkley Point C will be the UK’s largest engineering and construction project in modern times. This is a great opportunity,” he said. He accepted there would be some disruption as new infrastructure – roads, park and ride sites, accommodation blocks for workers – are built. He said action was being taken to make sure Hinkley did not leave other firms with a shortage of skilled workers, and plans to build new homes to try to prevent Bridgwater people from being displaced by new arrivals were on the drawing board. But he was convinced that the face of the town, long dismissed by many as second best to neighbouring Taunton, would improve. “There will be better shops, restaurants, hotels,” he said. Colliers International, a commercial property specialist, said the project was important not only to north Somerset but to the whole region, and could help create a new “south-west powerhouse”. Tim Davies, head of the Bristol office, said: “Irrespective of whether you agree with nuclear power, the commercial benefits that the development will bring to the region cannot be underestimated. “What is needed now is for work at Hinkley Point C to get under way as soon as possible, as this will unlock extensive opportunities along the massive supply chain required, and will benefit sectors including construction, industrial, offices and hospitality.” The construction union Ucatt welcomed the government’s decision. Brian Rye, its acting general secretary, said: “The go-ahead was vital for construction, which desperately needed the confirmation of such a major project following a slowdown in the industry caused by the Brexit vote. It is also good news for the overall economy as it helps to guarantee the stability of our future energy supply. “The construction of Hinkley Point C will create 25,000 job opportunities over the lifetime of the project and during that time 1,000 construction apprentices will be created.” Of course, not everyone was wholly positive. Chris Morgan, a west Somerset councillor who lives in Stogursey, one of the villages closest to Hinkley Point, expressed not jubilation but relief. “It’s gone on so long we almost got to the point where we didn’t think it was going to happen,” he said. “People are very anxious around here. Some have moved away because of the plans; others are going to have years of upheaval while the construction takes place.” Bridget Woodman, deputy director of the energy policy group at the University of Exeter, claimed the decision was a huge missed opportunity. She said: “The prime minister had a moment of common sense earlier in the summer when she realised that the viability of the project needed careful scrutiny, but in the end she has caved in to French and Chinese pressure to go ahead despite all the evidence stacking up that subsidising the station will cost electricity consumers billions of pounds over its lifetime, not to mention all the taxpayer underwriting for clearing up its radioactive waste when it stops operating. “This is a case of short-term politics winning out over the longer-term economic and environmental benefit of the nation. By going down the nuclear route, the prime minister has missed the opportunity to have a meaningful debate about the future development of the UK’s electricity system and the role that renewables and demand management can play in delivering cheaper, less environmentally damaging and more secure power than Hinkley Point.” Matilda King, 72, a retired civil servant, worried about possible disaster. “Look around here. All this – and all of us – could be gone if it does go bang.” she said. Allan Jeffrey, a former science teacher and a spokesperson for the campaign group Stop Hinkley, lives a few hundred metres from EDF’s visitor hub in the Angel Place shopping centre in Bridgwater. The front windows of his terraced house are adorned with anti-nuclear posters, the shelves inside heaving with files documenting Britain’s nuclear history. He summed up his reaction simply as “disappointed”, but remained convinced that the project would not go ahead in the end. “We’re told that nuclear power is safe but we’ve seen the devastating effects of accidents in Chernobyl and Japan,” he said. “This is old-fashioned technology when we should be investing in renewables.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/sep/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-station-enemies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-21T10:32:12Z","webTitle":"Judge the Hinkley Point nuclear station by its many enemies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/sep/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-station-enemies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/sep/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-station-enemies","fields":{"headline":"The quality of Hinkley Point's enemies suggests it's an idiotic venture","bodyText":"“You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies,” said Oscar Wilde. In the case of the UK government’s bid to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, the quality of its enemies suggests the plan is idiotic. On Monday, the chancellor George Osborne announced £2bn in government loan guarantees in a bid to get the French-Chinese consortium behind Hinkley to finally commit to the much-delayed £24.5bn project. Energy secretary, Amber Rudd, accompanying Osborne on his trip to China, said the new Hinkley plant was “reasonably priced and value for money” and would provide a chunk of the low-carbon electricity needed to meet the UK’s climate change targets. Last week, Vincent de Rivaz, the CEO of French energy company EDF, said the Hinkley deal was “the right technology, at the right price, at the right time”. It’s true that the UK needs secure, low-carbon energy and that renewables are intermittent. The problem is that, apart from those with political or real capital riding on the deal, virtually no-one thinks the Hinkley plant is the answer. Let’s start with well-known energy analyst Peter Atherton, who is no tree-hugger. He said the deal is “one of the worst ever signed by a British government”, who are buying the “most expensive conventional power station in the world”. He calculated Hinkley would be pumping out vast profits by the end of the 35-year index-linked deal: £5bn a year, paid for by you and me. “The numbers are eyewateringly attractive for EDF and its partners; not so good for the national purse,” he said. Osborne’s loan guarantees - a taxpayer bailout for lenders if the project fails - are “a clear case of socialising risk and privatising profits”. The hard-headed number crunchers at HSBC agree, noting the high costs and vast delays to EDF’s two other new plants in France and Finland: “We see ample reason for the UK government to delay or cancel the project.” Turning to the sober suits at the Financial Times, the message remains the same: that the costs are far too high, more expensive than every kind of renewable energy, bar offshore wind. “Backing out might upset the French and embarrass the government. But a wish to spare ministerial blushes is no excuse for saddling the country with costs it cannot afford,” concluded the FT editorial. There’s more. Lord Turnbull, who knows his way around Whitehall, having led the civil service, recently told Osborne the Hinkley deal was a “bottomless pit and a big white elephant”. Another peer, Lord Howell is a former Conservative energy secretary, a fracking fan and also happens to be Osborne’s father-in-law. He warned the reactor design planned for Hinkley C has never “been completed successfully” and that it was “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. Paul Massara, boss of RWE NPower, one of the UK’s Big Six, said: “We will look back and think that nuclear was a expensive mistake.” You’ll notice that not one of these Hinkley enemies I have cited are green activists, whose opposition can perhaps be taken for granted. But even those environmentalists who did back the deal, enraging many of their colleagues, have changed their minds. On Friday, George Monbiot, Mark Lynas, and Chris Goodall declared: “Hinkley C bears all the distinguishing features of a white elephant: overpriced, overcomplicated and overdue. The delay [to 2023 at the earliest] that was announced recently should be the final straw. The government should kill the project.” But as it stands, the government appears to be doing the opposite. It is not just trying to drag the Hinkley deal over the line, but is also aiming the get Chinese companies building other new reactors, of a completely different design. Energy security is serious, affordability is serious and tackling global warming is serious.

The warnings allowed for the possibility of waves of up to 3m (10 feet) along the country’s north-east Pacific coast, but the highest recorded wave, of 1.4m (4.6 feet), was observed at Sendai port shortly after 8am. The tsunami warnings in Fukushima and Miyagi were downgraded to the less severe status of advisories nearly four hours after the initial quake, although people were still urged to stay away from coastal areas. Similar tsunami advisories also remained in place in Iwate and Ibaraki prefectures, until all advisories were finally lifted nearly seven hours after the earthquake. There were no reports of severe injuries from the quake, which struck at a depth of 30 km (18.6 miles), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. In a statement, the agency said the earthquake was thought to be an aftershock of the 9.0-magnitude event that devastated the same region in 2011. The region was also hit by a series of weaker quakes throughout Tuesday. The Tokyo Electric Power Company said it had restored a cooling system at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant that briefly stopped after the quake, national broadcaster NHK reported. The car maker Nissan suspended work at its Fukushima factory, which was badly damaged by the 2011 disaster known as the Great East Japan Earthquake. A spokesman for the company told the Guardian all employees had been evacuated from the plant, which is in the city of Iwaki, and the factory was unlikely to return to operation on Tuesday. Meanwhile, firefighting officials in Iwaki in Fukushima said a fire broke out at a petrochemical complex and was later extinguished, NHK said. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is overseas for meetings, said the government would work with local governments to help any affected areas. “From my side, to the nation, we asked that proper and accurate information over the tsunami and the evacuation should be issued, and also to grasp and understand the condition of the damage as quickly as possible, and also to take proper emergency measures,” he said. Twelve people have suffered injuries, NHK reported, including an elderly woman in Fukushima prefecture who was said to have been hurt when a cupboard toppled over. The quake also shook other parts of Japan, including Tokyo. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world’s most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. The devastating 11 March 2011 quake was magnitude 9, the strongest quake in Japan on record. The massive tsunami it triggered caused world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. All nuclear plants on the coast threatened by the tsunami remain closed in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Only two reactors are operating in Japan, both in the south-west of the country. Even when in shutdown nuclear plants need cooling systems operating to keep spent fuel cool.

The prime minister had been hoping to pitch the UK as a global leader in free trade during her first major outing on the world stage at the G20 summit in Hangzhou. However, she was immediately confronted with harsh warnings about the consequences of leaving the EU and diplomatic tensions with the Chinese over her concerns about their involvement in UK nuclear power. After her first bilateral meeting with Obama, May was warned that the US wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of pacific nations before considering a deal with the UK. This was swiftly followed by a message from Japan to the UK that there could be a string of corporate exits from the UK unless some of the privileges that come with access to the single market are maintained. The lengthy document from Tokyo gives a list of possible consequences of Brexit and a series of specific requests from Japanese businesses. About half of Japanese investment in the EU comes to the UK, including from companies such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nomura and Daiwa. “Japanese businesses with their European headquarters in the UK may decide to transfer their head-office function to continental Europe if EU laws cease to be applicable in the UK after its withdrawal,” the report concludes. It says: “In light of the fact that a number of Japanese businesses, invited by the government in some cases, have invested actively to the UK, which was seen to be a gateway to Europe, and have established value-chains across Europe, we strongly request that the UK will consider this fact seriously and respond in a responsible manner to minimise any harmful effects on these businesses.” Earlier, Obama had promised to work hard to stop “adverse effects” of Brexit and assured the UK there was still a “very special relationship” between the two nations. But he also raised the risk of some trading relations unraveling and made clear that it “would not make sense to put aside” existing negotiations with big blocs of countries in order to do an immediate deal with the UK. Asked whether he stood by his warnings against Brexit and claim that Britain would go to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals, Obama repeated his belief that the world would benefit from the UK being a member of the EU. “I’ve committed to Theresa that we will consult closely with her as she and her government move forward on Brexit negotiations to make sure we don’t see adverse effects in our trading and commercial relationship. Obviously there is an enormous amount of trade that already takes place ... That is not going to stop. And we are going to do everything we can to make sure the consequences of the decision don’t end up unravelling what is already a very strong and robust economic relationship. “But first things first. The first task is figuring out what Brexit means with respect to Europe. And our first task is making sure we go forward on TTIP negotiations in which we have already invested a lot of time and effort.” It comes after the prime minister warned on her flight to China that there would be “difficult times ahead” for the economy after leaving the EU. The prime minister said the economy was in better shape than some had predicted following the vote for Brexit. However, May said she was not expecting an easy ride, as her ministers examine the possibility of a “fiscal reset” at the autumn statement – potentially abandoning some of the financial strategies and targets of former chancellor George Osborne. Speaking on the flight to Hangzhou, May said: “We have seen figures giving some different messages in relation to the economy. The reaction of the economy has been better than some had predicted post the referendum. “But I won’t pretend it is all going to be plain sailing. There will be some difficult times ahead. We will be looking ahead to the autumn statement. So in terms of how we are going to position things, the detail will be coming out then. What I’m clear about is I am going to continue as we have done in government over the last six years ensuring we are going to live within our means.” May also has to contend with diplomatic tensions with China over the country’s proposed multibillion investment in UK nuclear energy. She angered Beijing by placing the French and Chinese-backed Hinkley Point nuclear project under review in July, apparently over security concerns about Beijing’s involvement. Since then, there has been a suggestion that she could be happy for the Chinese to be a passive investor in Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset but does not want the country to have a more active role in developing a new plant at Sizewell in Suffolk or Bradwell in Essex. On the way to Hangzhou, she confirmed that she would go to her first meeting as prime minister with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Monday without having come to a decision about allowing Chinese investment in nuclear power to go ahead. “I am going to be talking to President Xi about a whole range of issues. I am not going to be taking the Hinkley decision until ... it’s not going to be taken now. It is going to be taken later this month. I am clear that what I am doing is looking at the evidence.” It is possible May is delaying the decision until after the issue can be discussed fully at the next national security council meeting of top spy and defence chiefs. Asked whether she trusted the Chinese, the prime minister gave an unclear answer. “Of course we have a relationship with them,” she replied. “We are working with them. And we have seen significant Chinese investment into the United Kingdom. What I want to do is build on that relationship. But I also want to be able to build on relationships with other countries. I want to be unashamedly open to free trade and a global leader in free trade.” May was at pains to stress that she wanted to talk to many other world leaders, not just the Chinese, in a signal that she does not intend to place such a heavy emphasis on the “golden era” of relations proposed by Cameron and Osborne. “What’s happened in the last few years is that the government has built a new strategic partnership with China, the golden era of relationships,” she said. “We will want to continue to build on that. “I will be meeting President Xi and talking to him but I will be meeting other world leaders as well and wanting to talk to them about the opportunities we can develop looking at free trade. We’ve already seen with some of the early conversations their interest in talking about trading arrangements, the Australians for example.” May embarked on her first trip to China on the new prime ministerial plane used just once by David Cameron before he was replaced. After landing, she headed to the summit for meetings with Obama, the Saudi deputy crown prince, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before the first official session at the summit on the economy. May stressed that Britain was “open for business” and wanted to promote free trade but also argued world leaders must be mindful of concerns about globalisation leaving some people behind while others flourish. “I want to be talking about the opportunities for free trade around the world, about how Britain can seize those opportunities and I want us to be a global leader in free trade. But we can’t ignore as we look at the G20 the fact there is a sentiment out there in a number of countries that is anti-globalisation,” she said. “That is something else we need to consider, looking at whether when we put these free trade agreements in place they are going to work for everyone.” A UK official source said the meeting between May and Obama had been warm, with both sides agreeing that officials would start talking about some of the issues around post-Brexit trade. Asked about the priority given to trade deals with other blocs, the source said: “He is a president who has invested a lot of time in multilateral trade deals. I don’t think him talking up those and the focus and effort the US have put into those is that much of a surprise.” On the Japanese warning, the source added it was “not unhelpful” to understand where the UK’s trading partners have concerns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/12/uk-must-move-now-on-carbon-capture-to-save-consumers-billions-says-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-12T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"UK must move now on carbon capture to save consumers billions, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/uk-must-move-now-on-carbon-capture-to-save-consumers-billions-says-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/12/uk-must-move-now-on-carbon-capture-to-save-consumers-billions-says-report","fields":{"headline":"UK must move now on carbon capture to save consumers billions, says report","bodyText":"The UK must immediately kickstart an industry to capture and bury carbon emissions in order to save consumers billions a year from the cost of meeting climate change targets, according to a high-level advisory group appointed by ministers. This requires the setting up of a new state-backed company to create the network needed to pipe the emissions into exhausted oil and gas fields under the North Sea, the group said. With this government backing, carbon capture and storage (CCS) could deliver clean electricity at a lower cost than an expanded Hinkley Point nuclear power station and almost all renewables, the group’s report states. A CCS industry could also provide thousands of jobs, particularly in industrial heartlands such as Teesside and Grangemouth, and help reverse the fortunes of the declining North Sea fossil fuel industry. It could even tackle the major problem of cutting emissions from gas boilers, by enabling clean-burning hydrogen to be pumped into the grid. Failing to deliver CCS would hugely increase the cost of tackling climate change, according to the government’s official climate advisors, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel. But in November the government made a shock decision to cancel a £1bn CCS development competition at the last minute, citing high costs. The new report, commissioned in the aftermath by then energy secretary Amber Rudd, says using a state-backed company would slash the price. “Money spent now will save money later,” said Lord Ron Oxburgh, an independent member of the House of Lords and former chairman of Shell Transport and Trading, who led the report. “CCS is a priority for Britain if our 2050 climate goals are to be achieved at least expense. Government intervention and leadership is crucial and, in common with major projects such as the delivery of the London Olympics, the role of the public sector will be crucial in the early years.” “There were a number of people in our group that were sceptical that this really was the least-cost way forward, but even our hard-nosed bankers and businessmen agreed,” he said. Lord Oxburgh said, despite the technology being ready, no commercial company could justify investing in the CCS pipe network by itself: “There is no serious commercial incentive and it will stay that way unless the state demonstrates there is a business there.” Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a CCS expert at Edinburgh University and a member of the advisory group, said another crucial immediate action is to take into temporary public ownership the offshore pipelines to the gas fields of Atlantic, Goldeneye and Hamilton, which are imminently due to be decommissioned but would be ideal for transporting CO2 to storage sites. The report will be presented to Rudd’s successor, Greg Clark, who is secretary of state at the new Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). A spokeswoman for BEIS said the recommendations of the report would be carefully considered, but that the costs of CCS had to be competitive if it was to play a part in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK’s economy. “We will need a range of technologies as we create a clean energy future but above all we must ensure they are affordable,” she said. The report argues this can be achieved for CCS if the government immediately sets up a state-backed company which would then build gas-fired power stations with CCS technology and develop the network to transport and bury the CO2. With the pipes in place, the company would then be able to take and store CO2 from other power and industrial plants, charging for the service. Income would come from the levies on consumer energy bills that currently support low carbon electricity such as renewables and nuclear power. The report says support of £85/MWh would be sufficient, cheaper than all renewables bar onshore wind – now virtually halted by the government – and Hinkley Point C. The company would need £200-£300m of government seed funding, the report says, with private investors providing the rest. Once established, the power plants could be privatised and the transport and storage enterprise run as a regulated utility with prices capped, like a water company. “It is not government subsidy, this is government investment, and with any luck the government will get its money back and better as time goes on,” said Lord Oxburgh. CCS could capture 40% of the UK’s emissions by 2050, according to the report, saving up to £5bn a year compared to alternative strategies. CCS could also potentially enable hydrogen to solve the problem of cutting the emissions from the nation’s gas boilers and stoves, currently 25% of all emissions and a major factor in the UK’s imminent failure to meet clean energy targets. Natural gas can be converted to hydrogen and the CO2 produced buried using CCS. The hydrogen, which produces only water when burned, could then replace the gas in the national grid. This could also provide fuel for hydrogen-powered cars, as well as cutting the significant air pollution caused by gas boilers. Lord Oxburgh said he only partly blamed the big fossil fuel companies for not developing CCS themselves, in order to protect their businesses from climate change laws: “Ultimately you have to answer to your shareholders. As far as they are concerned, if you have a company that is doing alright and making money, why waste time and money doing something that may or may not pay off? “It really has to do with how convinced people were that the government was serious about climate change. Once the government really shows its commitment, CCS will take off.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/07/study-reveals-huge-acceleration-in-erosion-of-englands-white-cliffs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-07T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Study reveals huge acceleration in erosion of England's white cliffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/07/study-reveals-huge-acceleration-in-erosion-of-englands-white-cliffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/07/study-reveals-huge-acceleration-in-erosion-of-englands-white-cliffs","fields":{"headline":"Study reveals huge acceleration in erosion of England's white cliffs","bodyText":"The iconic white cliffs of southern England are eroding 10 times faster than they have over the past few thousand years, a new study has revealed. The cause of the huge acceleration is likely to be human management of the coastline, which has stripped some cliffs of their protective beaches, as well as changes in storm intensity. Climate change, which is bringing higher sea levels and fiercer waves, will make the erosion even worse, say scientists. Researchers analysed rocks from Beachy Head and Seaford Head in East Sussex and discovered that the cliff erosion rate over most of the past 7,000 years was just two-six centimetres a year. But the erosion rate over the past 150 years has been much higher at 22-32cm a year. “We were very surprised at the stark difference,” said Martin Hurst, at the University of Glasgow, who led the new work, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “If you have a nice thick and wide beach in front of a cliff, that reflects wave energy. But the beaches have all but disappeared.” Coastlines have often been managed to try to protect specific beaches, using groynes or the shifting of sand and gravel. But management near Seaford has led to the cliffs to the east, including Beachy Head, being starved of sediments. “We need to be aware that when we manage the beach in one place, there is a knock-on effect somewhere else,” said Hurst. He said the new information on the long-term rates of erosion will enable researchers to make better predictions for the future about how global warming will affect coastlines: “We are concerned that increasing sea level rise and more storms will drive more erosion.” Almost 7,000 homes in England and Wales are expected to fall into the sea in coming decades as coasts erode. “Humans have significantly altered this coastal system,” said Prof Rob Duck, at the University of Dundee, who was not part of the research team. He said that past gravel extraction was also to blame. “The gravels of the beaches of the south coast were much-prized materials for a whole range of construction activities and were extracted in massive amounts over long periods. This has certainly aggravated the problems of erosion on the south coast of England and it will only get worse as relative sea level and storminess increase due to climate change.” The scientists were able to calculate the historic erosion rates by measuring the amount of an isotope of beryllium in the rock platform under the cliffs. This isotope is formed in the top few metres of rock when it is struck by cosmic rays from space and the longer the rock is exposed, the higher the concentration. This enables the estimation of the speed of the cliff’s retreat. Hurst and his colleagues now aim to apply the technique to other parts of the UK coastline, including the stretch at Hinkley Point, the site of a large new nuclear power station."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/27/cefc-approached-about-coal-fired-power-station-but-says-plant-not-financeable","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-27T06:46:18Z","webTitle":"CEFC approached about coal-fired power station but says plant not 'financeable'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/27/cefc-approached-about-coal-fired-power-station-but-says-plant-not-financeable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/27/cefc-approached-about-coal-fired-power-station-but-says-plant-not-financeable","fields":{"headline":"CEFC approached about coal-fired power station but says plant not 'financeable'","bodyText":"The Clean Energy Finance Corporation was approached last Friday by proponents of a new $1.2bn coal-fired power station with carbon capture and storage technology – but officials have cast significant doubt about whether such a project could ultimately proceed. The CEFC’s outgoing chief executive, Oliver Yates, told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday his organisation had received an email submission about the project, which purports to be a 900 megawatt power station with a capital cost of $1.2bn. But Yates told the committee a new coal-fired plant was not “financeable” without the government agreeing to indemnify the project against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced and against the cost of delays in the project prompted by likely community protest action. He said it would be very hard for such a project to get finance when it was unclear what a future carbon price would be and he said the CEFC would not lend money to a project when it was totally unclear whether or not it would be economically viable. As part of its recent “clean” coal pivot, the Turnbull government has signalled that it will seek to change the CEFC’s rules to allow the so-called “green” bank fund new “clean” coal plants. The government has been arguing additional coal-fired power in Australia would provide secure base load energy. In early February the resources minister, Matt Canavan, flagged subsidising a “clean” coal baseload power plant from the government’s $5bn northern Australia infrastructure fund and he said the government had already heard from an interested party who was eyeing off opportunities in the Galilee Basin – the planned site of the Adani coalmine. The Coalition is under acute political pressure from a resurgent One Nation in Queensland. On Monday, the outspoken LNP backbencher George Christensen told the Australian he favoured the construction of a high-intensity, low-emissions coal-fired power station in North Queensland. A poll in Christensen’s seat of Dawson, published by the ABC on Monday, put One Nation level-pegging with the LNP on primary votes. The ReachTEL poll, commissioned by the Australia Institute, gave the LNP 30.4% of the vote, compared with 30% for One Nation, in the Queensland seat currently held by Christensen. Currently, the CEFC cannot invest in any project that does not reduce emissions by 50% or more on the average across the national electricity market. The CEFC rules, set by the previous Labor government, also rule out funding nuclear power and carbon capture and storage. During Monday’s estimates hearing, Yates told the committee an ultra super critical coal plant would not meet the current CEFC definition of a low-emissions project but he said the government could issue a new investment mandate for the organisation that would redraw the definitions. He confirmed that government could unilaterally issue a new investment mandate indicating that it was desirable for the organisation to invest in a clean coal project – and that directive would not be disallowable by the parliament. In saying that, Yates observed it would be difficult to redraw the boundaries of the investment mandate without creating inconsistencies with the overall objectives of the organisation, describing that process as “an area of art rather than science”. The outgoing CEFC chief executive said that, even if the boundaries were redrawn, there would still be a threshold problem of the CEFC investing in projects when it was unclear whether they were commercially viable and when there was no insurance against the “unhedged risk” of a future carbon price. Yates said the CEFC was “not into considering loss-making ventures”. He also confirmed that, if the government wanted the CEFC to invest in carbon capture and storage, then new legislation would be required and that would have to run the gauntlet of the parliament. Separately, as the government attempted to resume its political campaign on energy security and power prices, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, found himself under pressure from the Sydney radio host Ray Hadley about the government’s renewable energy target. Hadley picked up on Tony Abbott’s attack on the RET in his provocative speech last Thursday, telling Morrison it was very hard for the Coalition to launch a political attack on Labor for having a 50% renewable energy goal when the government’s policy was a 23.5% RET. Hadley declared the RET was “unachievable”. Morrison batted off the critique. “Ray, when you put in laws around whether it’s this issue or any other issue, if you go in and put them in one day, and then you change them the next day, what do you think people who are investing are going to do and thinking about the stability of government policy? “That’s called sovereign risk. That’s when people start pulling money out of the country and people start losing their jobs.” “Now, a RET at where it’s currently sitting at 23.5%, we had that discussion under prime minister Abbott. That’s what was put in place. If you go and change this every other Thursday then frankly you put people’s jobs at risk.” Morrison said the government was currently focusing on what came after the RET, which is currently legislated out until 2020. “That’s when you’ve got to ensure that you have the energy base load and capacity that’s sustainable,” Morrison said. “We’re focusing on the actual problem.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2020/feb/05/national-party-coalition-cabinet-reshuffle-scott-morrison-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-05T06:50:14Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton says bushfires not started by climate change but arsonists – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/05/national-party-coalition-cabinet-reshuffle-scott-morrison-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/05/national-party-coalition-cabinet-reshuffle-scott-morrison-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Peter Dutton says bushfires not started by climate change but arsonists – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it from the blog today, but we will be back tomorrow for the last sitting day of this week – remember there is a whole other week to get through after this, so let’s take the time to stare at walls while we can.

Constitutional expert Anne Twomey who has questioned the constitutionality of the sports grants funding, has also previously questioned the constitutionality of ‘Stronger Communities’ grants (which is what the Cronulla Sailing Club was awarded its BBQ through, in the post with Scott Morrison’s PA) From AAP: Labor has failed to force the Morrison government to establish a national integrity commission before reviving a union-busting bill in the Senate. The opposition also wanted the recommendations of the banking and aged care royal commissions implemented before the government’s “ensuring integrity” laws are debated. The three lofty conditions were designed to ward off a vote on the legislation, which would make it easier to deregister unions and ban officials. The Morrison government suffered a humiliating defeat last year when One Nation made the shock decision to shoot the bill down in the Senate in December. But Labor frontbencher Katy Gallagher’s motion was voted down 36 votes to 31 on Wednesday, with minor parties One Nation and Centre Alliance opposed. Labor’s motion would have erected a parliamentary roadblock until: * legislation to establish a national integrity commission receives royal assent * all recommendations from the banking royal commission are legislated * the interim recommendations of the aged care royal commission are legislated. Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, who looms as the crucial senator on the union bill, abstained from the vote.

From AAP: A powerful parliamentary committee will not consider whether Energy Minister Angus Taylor misled parliament over his use of a fake document to criticise Sydney’s mayor. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke asked Speaker Tony Smith last December to look at whether Mr Taylor had misled parliament and should be referred to the privileges committee. If found to have misled parliament it would constitute being in contempt of parliament. Mr Burke had pointed to six statements Mr Taylor made to parliament, where he said his office had used travel figures downloaded from the City of Sydney’s website. The figures used by Mr Taylor to attack Clover Moore cited travel spending of more than $15 million, when the council had spent about $6000. Slapping down the referral to the privileges committee, Mr Smith said there wasn’t enough evidence to show Mr Taylor had misled parliament. “I understand this matter is surrounded by differing views,” he told parliament. “However, the matter of misleading the House is a very serious one and, rightly, there should be prima facie evidence that the House has been misled, and that the misleading has been deliberate.” A NSW police investigation into the fake travel figures has been referred to the Australian Federal Police. Before I run screaming from the room, here is what the police said about those arson figures in January: From the police: Victoria police say there is no evidence any of the devastating bushfires in the state were caused by arson, contrary to the spread of global disinformation exaggerating arsonist arrests during the current crisis. A misleading figure suggesting 183 arsonists have been arrested “since the start of the bushfire season” spread across the globe on Wednesday, after initial reports in News Corp were picked up by Donald Trump Jr, US far-right websites and popular alt-right personalities. The figure included statistics from some states covering the entirety of 2019, rather than just the current bushfire season, which began in September. Peter Dutton continues: Obviously, as we’ve all pointed out, we’re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That’s not climate change. Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires were lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says: Nobody’s disputing that. There’s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. I’m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. I think the views in our party room say that we want action on climate change. Yes, we’ve got that climate change action now happening. And we’re responding to it. Equally let’s be honest about the role that the fuel load played in some of these forests. I just think it’s, I think it’s completely disingenuous if people aren’t recognising the different elements. There’s three elements, including people who have started fires in significant numbers. Some fires that have been put out and then restarted by people. I think all that’s happening in our party room is that people are saying we want recognition of those three elements so that we don’t have the same intensity of the bushfires next season, but because the work of our firefighters, of people in my own department, and many other people across the commonwealth including scores of volunteers, we should pay tribute to them because I think thousands of more homes would have been lost. Hundreds more lives would have been lost and I think the response has been quite remarkable from every element of our society. I think we should be very proud of the way in which we’ve responded as a society to deal with the bushfires and to respond in the aftermath. Peter Dutton on the ‘non-existent’ debate on climate change within the Coalition party room. Please make sure your eyes remain in your head and your jaw stays within catching distance: Look, I’ve been following this debate for a long time and I’ve been in parliament for 18 years. I don’t see huge points of difference in our party room. I think the way in which the PM went through all of that which we’re doing, the targets we’re exceeding, the uptake of renewable energy, our investment in to new technologies, when you look at what he had to say the other day, I think that is absolutely reflective of the view that’s in the party room. I think the point that is made frankly by some which maybe it’s a matter of interpretation or ways in which people want to massage this according to their own interpretation, I think people in our party room are saying we want action on climate change but in relation to the bushfires we absolutely believe that a large number of the bushfires were more intense because of the fact there hadn’t been back-burning. Peter Dutton is apparently now #teamsourdough Here he is on Michael McCormack: I trust Michael McCormack’s judgement completely. I’ve got to say. I watch him in Cabinet in the NSC [national security committee] and leadership group and he has a very sound common sense decency about him. Patricia Karvelas asks Peter Dutton about David Littleproud’s comments on 7.30 last night. As a reminder, here they are from Paul Karp’s report: Asked if it was right for the former sports minister to hand grants out according to a spreadsheet colour-coded by the party holding the electorate in which it was located, Littleproud replied: “Well, obviously I don’t think that necessarily getting as partisan as that is the best way to do it.” Dutton claims that Littleproud, who said the comments directly in his own words, in response to a question, which he answered, using his own mouth, was “misrepresented”. I didn’t see those comments from him. I was in a conversation with him this morning where it was quite clear he had been misrepresented in what he said. But the general point is that recommendations were made in relation to sporting grants, all of the projects, those that were awarded and those that were recommended but not awarded are all worthy projects. Peter Dutton is talking about the border force response to coronavirus on the ABC. It includes this exchange between himself and Patricia Karvelas: PK: China says it wasn’t given enough warning about the travel ban. Do you know when they were notified of it? Dutton: Obviously it’s on DFAT’s side of the ledger. We’ve been very positive about the way in which China is engaged with the foreign affairs department. But our staff in China and the ambassador there. We’ve had very productive engagement. All of us are reacting very quickly to changing circumstances, the health advice changes. We need to be malleable in terms of the way in which we respond as well. There are decisions we’ll make which are in our country’s best interest but we’ll have a very short lead time. We gave notice to the Chinese. We worked with them very closely around the uplift of these people and in particular in terms of the announcements that we make otherwise. It’s important to point out that [Queensland] Premier [Annastacia] Palaszczuk, having heard the recommendation from the expert medical committee, where her chief medical officer in Queensland was part of the discussion, knew that recommendation was coming to the PM and went out there gratuitously, calling for us to stop incoming flights from China, knowing frankly that was probably the decision we were going to make. So we need to move quickly, particularly when there’s been that sort of breach, pretty agregious breach of the committee’s work and Premier Palaszczuk still hasn’t apologised for that. PK: [Are you alleging] Queensland premier gaming the system, using confidential information to try and get political capital out of it? Dutton: I don’t think it’s any allegation. It’s what happened. That’s exactly what happened. I think the premier of Queensland has got a lot of explaining to do, to be honest. All of these factors will lead into those decisions. Just for context - the Queensland election is in October. Paul Karp has the terms of reference for that inquiry: That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Administration of Sports Grants, be established to inquire into and report on the administration and award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program, with particular reference to: (a) program design and guidelines; (b) requirements placed on applicants for funding; (c) management and assessment processes; (d) adherence to published assessment processes and program criteria; (e) the role of the offices of the Minister, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and any external parties, in determining which grants would be awarded and who would announce the successful grants; and (f) any related programs or matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before Tuesday 24 March 2020. (3) That the committee consist of 5 senators, as follows: (a) 2 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate; (b) 2 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and (c) 1 nominated by the Leader of the Australian Greens. The Labor [and Greens] motion to establish a Senate inquiry into the sport grant affair has passed the Senate – and in the end, the opposition did not need the crossbench. It seems like not even the government senators (of which Bridget McKenzie leads the Nationals in that chamber) opposed it. Joe Hockey will be the 7.30 guest tonight. I assume he will be wearing a shirt (see his instagram if you need the context) For those who want to see all the MPI, you can watch parliament live, here. Anthony Albanese has the matter of public importance today. It’s on ‘the failure of the government to provide leadership’. Albanese: Everyone knows that this has been a summer of disaster. For the prime minister and this government though, it has been a summer of complacency. It has been one whereby their arrogance and their hubris has been on full display before the Australian people. One in which the prime minister refuses to ever admit that he made a mistake. One in which facts are twisted to suit the prime minister’s own political position. One in which he has been exposed as an ad-man without a plan. On the matter of deliberately misleading the house, Tony Smith says there is not a prima facie case that he did. Therefore, it will not be referred to the privileges committee. Tony Smith is dealing with the issue Tony Burke raised in the last sitting year of whether or not Angus Taylor deliberately misled the House. There is one last question on the new veterans commission and the first question time of the year is done. Here is where Scott Morrison says “hazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future”. But given the window to complete hazard reduction burns is rapidly shortening because of those “hotter, drier, longer” summers – when are we supposed to do the hazard reduction burns safely? And that’s a point which has been raised by the current fire chiefs Morrison says he listens to, not just the former fire chiefs. Exactly And it’s back: Matt Canavan has been allowed to speak in the Senate: We are at the swap chamber sides of the motion death gurgle. Richard Marles manages to get out “corrupt sports rorts” (which he repeats) before he is shut down (he doesn’t care, he said what he wanted). While the MPs are moving around the motion of not passing motions, the new Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has taken the time to tweet and delete: From AAP: A man has been arrested, the bomb squad are attending the scene and multiple busy streets in Melbourne’s CBD have been locked down. Police shut down the Flinders and William streets intersection on Wednesday afternoon following the arrest. The closed-off area was expanded to include parts of King, William, Market and Queensbridge streets. Trams are being delayed because of the arrest, but trains have resumed after initially being told to stop. Scott Morrison, who has repeatedly said he won’t be told how to govern by the people on Twitter, is now doing tweet threads (or some poor person in his office is): Christian Porter has moved that Anthony Albanese will no longer be heard, which will win, and then a second Labor MP will attempt to move the motion. Then that will be shut down. The first motion from Anthony Albanese: That this House one, notes the prime minister: a) has repeatedly refused to admit his failings in handling the ongoing bushfire crisis. b) has tried to cover up his failings with a series of false claims. c) is ignoring the damning report of the independent auditor general concerning his corrupt sports rorts scheme, and is instead relying on a secret report by his former chief of staff. d) refuses to give straight answers to simple questions. e) has no plan for this country, only a marketing plan for himself. And two, therefore calls on the prime minister to stop acting in his own interest and start acting in the national interest. While we go through the motions of not having a motion, David Littleproud and Michael McCormack are looking very concerned over some document in their hand. I assume it is not a hardcopy of the blog. There’s an app for that. Leave is not granted. We move on to the next part (which will also not be granted). Anthony Albanese is seeking leave to suspend standing orders to move a motion on the prime minister being terrible (my take of what Albanese is saying). This will fail. I was just about to do a post on this, but now I don’t have to (my boss is always a million steps ahead of me): Sarah Martin, who is in the chamber, tells me a protester stood up to yell “what would it take for the prime minister to declare a climate emergency”, which received applause from others in the public gallery. He was removed. The member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, was asked to withdraw an unparliamentary remark. “Which one,” he quips, before withdrawing. Scott Morrison continues that answer (which shows you how under pressure the government feels on this): So the minister who had the authority to make those decisions made those decisions and as she made very clear in her own statements at the time, she was seeking to make those decisions in the best interests of that program, what it was seeking to do. The point I was making is that the commonwealth government rules and grants rules and guidelines are there to ensure that where a minister may take a view about what she believes is a project with greater merit, there’s a process for setting out how it’s different to the recommendations received. The auditor general report did not find that elected members of this House, it did not find that ministers should not be making decisions about the expenditure of public monies to suit the programs that have been established. The process is to ensure you get good advice, and you can consider that advice, but ministers must make decisions. If those opposite think that ministers should be audit takers from public officials, that’s for them to say. I believe that each member advocates for the needs of their community. And these members advocated for the needs of their community. And the minister made decisions, all eligible projects, and made the final decision as was her authority under the program as it was established. Where there are improvements to be made to that program in the future, they have been accepted. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: In his previous answer, the prime minister failed to endorse decisions made by his own government to reject projects that were assessed above 90 out of 100 for merit. Were the projects that received money under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme the ones that had the most merit? Morrison: As the member knows, the program was set up that gave total authority to the minister, to make decisions ... ... I’m only referring to the findings of the auditor general’s report. That report articulated, Mr Speaker, that the authority to make those decisions was by the minister, Mr Speaker, and the auditor general’s report made a very important recommendation, which the government accepts. And that recommendation was recommendation four, which deals with the issue of the application of the commonwealth grant rules and guidelines, Mr Speaker. Now, as the auditor general’s report outlines, which we accept, it says that those guidelines should be applied in the future, by organisations such as Sport Australia. The government has accepted that recommendation and we believe that will assist these ... Burke interjects: The question does not go to future programs. The question goes to decisions made by this government and whether or not the prime minister believes those decisions were made on merit. Tony Smith allows Morrison to go on: The point I was seeking to make, the minister made the decisions about where the projects should be supported, Mr Speaker. Based on her assessment, based or her assessment that what would be the projects of greatest support and merit in the community. She had the authority to do that. Pat Conroy to Scott Morrison: Are the projects that received money under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme the ones that had the most merit? Morrison: I believe funding community sports infrastructure always has merit. As much merit as most on the frontbench, I would say. Peter Dutton makes an appearance to tell you how safe you are from coronavirus. As safe as the government can make you. He is missing his usual Dutton-ness. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister fund all projects recommended by Sport Australia under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme, but not funded by this government? Morrison: Funding these important infrastructure projects is and has been a priority of this government. We have – the program received applications for some $400m, $400m, Mr Speaker. And we allocated $100m. As I said last week, we think this infrastructure is important to local communities. And I did say, at the press club last week, I’ll be working with the treasurer as we prepare for this year’s budget to see how we can provide further support for this important infrastructure that brings communities together. He is asked for relevance, but he has concluded his answer. Sidenote: we are getting a few more mentions of the “Morrison-McCormack government” today, a phrase which was previously only trotted out when Michael McCormack was being asked a question. Seems like this is one of the bones the Liberals are throwing to McCormack, as they try to remind people he exists. Joel Fitzgibbon, who was being touted as the perfect leader of the Nationals yesterday, has a question for Michael McCormack: My question is to the deputy prime minister. Why is it that yesterday when the rest of the parliament was focused only on memorialising bushfire victims, National party ministers and members were more focused on fighting amongst themselves? It is ruled out of order, but not because it would bring McCormack back to the dispatch box. Only the prime minister can answer questions about everything. Other ministers only have to answer on their portfolios. We’ll get through coronavirus, says Greg Hunt. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister explain how his entire office found time to attend a marketing seminar run by adman Russel Howcroft on a catastrophic fire day in December? Why did he refuse to meet with the 23 former fire chiefs pleading for the government to take this bushfire season seriously? Morrison: Well, Mr Speaker, the meeting you refer to was not a meeting that I attended. Mr Speaker ... The meeting that you also said was requested and was well publicised, related to former fire chiefs. I engage with current fire chiefs, Mr Speaker. And the current fire chiefs have provided the advice going into this fire season was the same fire advice that was provided by Emergency Management Australia, when I asked Emergency Management Australia to come and brief cabinet well, well before the fire season, Mr Speaker. Last year, to advise us what was necessary and to ensure we were compliant and we were taking action to ensure the commonwealth’s position was in the best position it could be to support state and territory authorities as they moved through this devastating fire season. That included the additional funding that we announced that I referred to earlier in response to the member for Gilmore’s question, to provide the additional support for the aerial bombers. It ensured in November the government undertook a trial program for the compulsory callout of reserves to ensure in the event we would move to that situation it would be done seamlessly. This has been one of the most significant responses of the government to ensure we went from a situation of around 895 defence force personnel on the ground in December, to 6,500 and more on the ground in January. That changed because the government changed the disposition of the commonwealth’s deployment of defence forces on the ground. Not to respond to requests, but to take this to the extreme of the constitutionality, Mr Speaker. The extreme of constitutionality to respond, Mr Speaker, to the situation that emerged that week, where on the Thursday it was the first day the national state of disaster was declared in Victoria. That hadn’t occurred before. That happened on the Thursday. There was the compulsory callout on the Saturday and the preparations for that compulsory callout were already under way when Victoria made that declaration. Mr Speaker, those opposite in the questions today are seeking to politicise this disaster and it’s very disappointing. The second set of Labor questions in Senate question time is again to Richard Colbeck on sports rorts – and the auditor general’s finding that funding went to target marginal seats. At first, Colbeck deploys the reverse-pork barrelling defence that Bridget McKenzie’s intervention lifted the proportion of projects in Labor electorates from 26% to 34%. Then, he quoted a 2010 auditor general’s report that found an aspect of Labor’s fiscal stimulus program “disproportionately favoured ALP held seats”. Anthony Albanese defended the program at the time by noting: “The allocation of funding across federal electorates was in line with the political makeup of the House of Representatives. Put simply, Labor MPs held 55.3% of the electorates and their local councils secured 56.7% of the funding from the program’s Strategic Projects component.” Just a bit more on what Scott Morrison said in answer to Zali Steggall (and why, no matter how they brand it, or what words they choose to market it, or if they even decide to appoint a minister to directly deal with it, ‘climate action now’ is just hollow doublespeak that won’t lead to any actual changes): Of course, Australia must continue to table the actions if we are to meet and beat our emissions reductions target, which have already seen us reduce emissions, Mr Speaker, by 12.8% since 2005. We have a reduction target we took to the Australian people out to 2030 that will see emissions per capita fall by half. We are ahead of countries like New Zealand, ahead of countries like Canada in meeting and beating our targets, some 411m tonnes we will have beat our Kyoto emissions target. At the same time, our renewable energy, Mr Speaker, per capita is half what it’s been – is double, I should say, more than double what’s being achieved in Germany, and in many other countries around the world and we have one of the highest levels of investments in renewable energy anywhere in the world. In the developed world. We have one of the highest – in fact, we have the highest target of emissions reduction now to 2030 in Asia compared to those nations. Emissions reduction is important. We’re acting on that reduction. I can tell you also resilience to climate is also important. Hazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future. Also, in a country ravaged by drought, and the impacts that we have experienced, and that drought continues, building dams is climate action now. There you go. Burning the trees that help to create clean air and create rainfall, is EVEN MORE IMPORTANT in protecting you from the longer, hotter, drier summers than emissions reduction. The next dixer is on why the budget might be looking a little sad, because of the summer – plus drought, plus coronavirus, plus those pesky global headwinds. “Unprecedented” is being thrown around again. It’s almost like surprises can happen that you can’t prepare for – like the global financial crisis – which impact your bottom line. Sidenote: Josh Frydenberg still hasn’t worked out how microphones work. Pro tip: they amplify your voice so you DON’T HAVE TO YELL. The member for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister claim he always acted on the advice of fire commissioners when he ignored for two years their advice to provide a permanent boost to Australia’s aerial firefighting capability? Morrison: I thank the member for her question. And can I, through her, pass on again my sincere condolences and sympathies and support to all those members in her electorate. I have members of my own family who live in your electorate. I want to thank you for the work that you have done, as all members have done, over the course of this bushfire season in supporting their local communities. I would be grateful if you could do that, if you have the opportunity. The member has raised the matter of the recommendations that were made through fire chiefs regarding the aerial firefighting assets. And what the government had done was respond to that, with two separate tranches of funding, which matched what they originally asked for. I dealt with this matter during the course of the bushfire season, but in addition to those two funding allocations of $11m, on top of that we announced a further $20m. That was over and above the $15m that was being provided each and every year as part of the arrangement that we had. We were pleased to do that. I also noted that the ongoing funding, which was being sought, would be addressed in this year’s budget. “Build back better” is not a personality. Labor’s Josh Burns becomes the second MP thrown out this year. Lucky him. The sentient sourdough loaf serving as the deputy prime minister is doing his best to string words together about resilience and regional Australia, but it’s hard when you are still fermenting. Keith Pitt inflicts Michael McCormack on us for the first question time of 2020 – almost a sure sign that he is in the ministry. And maybe his biggest sin so far. Labor’s Terri Butler becomes the first MP to be kicked out for 2020. Zali Steggall asks about what the government is doing about emissions reduction and the answer is so depressing (you have heard it all before – Australia is doing amazing, sweetie) and I want to stab myself in the face with a fork. Oh – and also hazard reduction and “building dams is climate action now”, according to Scott Morrison. You can build all the holes in the ground you want. It won’t make it forking rain. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to his previous answer where he suggested that it was necessary to have a Liberal party authorisation on his ad which had a Liberal party donation button attached to it. Isn’t it a fact that only electoral matter requires party authorisation and there is long precedent for government information which is not party political to not require such an authorisation? The only reason why it was authorised by the Liberal party is because it was so political. Morrison: The video presentation was posted on my Facebook page, Mr Speaker. And that requires an authorisation and that is the advice that is provided to me. That is the same as is practiced by the leader of the opposition and I table, Mr Speaker, his tweet that says: “Listening to people, respecting people, putting forward practical suggestions that would make a difference – that’s what I have been focused on. That is what I will continue to do. Authorised by Anthony Albanese, ALP, Canberra.” I have followed the practice in communicating with the Australian people. To the Labor party, to characterise it in the way they have is simply false and a misrepresentation by a Labor party leader who wants to politicise the bushfires. Except one is from an opposition leader and one was about the Australian government response to a national emergency. Which was not on behalf of the Liberal party, but at the behest of the Australian government, using Australian resources. But you can see where this is going. The sport minister, Richard Colbeck, has been asked about the sports rorts program – specifically whether he has seen the colour-coded spreadsheet from which former minister Bridget McKenzie selected projects. At first, Colbeck takes the chance to “extol the virtues of the program” that gave $100m to 684 sports clubs in the form of grants. After numerous points of order, Colbeck finally answers that he hasn’t “seen that document because the ABC hasn’t published it” – he has only seen excerpts of the spreadsheet. Asked about a probe into whether the health department of Sport Australia was the source of the leak, Colbeck replies there is “no issue” with the department, it is confident it was not the source of the leak. But he has not received advice from Sport Australia, which had “already commenced a process to satisfy themselves” before Colbeck asked. Next dixer is on the government’s new commission into veterans’ suicides and mental health. • For information and support in Australia call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret using his official resources to create and launch a party political advertisement on a catastrophic day at the height of bushfire crisis, which included defence imagery, a jingle and a link to a Liberal party donation button? Morrison: The leader of the opposition has come to that dispatch box and told a complete falsehood. The government and the members opposite know ... (INTERJECTIONS) ... on any ... I note the constant interjections on matters of bushfires, Mr Speaker, from those opposite. But on every piece of communication that you provide in video, the advice is that that material must be authorised, Mr Speaker, and I have noted that the leader of the opposition ... (Tony Smith tells the house to settle down) Morrison: Those communications require an authorisation to be compliant, and that’s what the government has done. That’s what the leader of the opposition has done, Mr Speaker, with his video communications on these types of issues. Mr Speaker, the only people trying to politicise the response to the bushfire crisis is the leader of the opposition. Except this was an Australian government announcement, which was authorised by Scott Morrison of the Liberal party, not the Australian government, and it did, when first launched, go to the Liberal party site, where it asked for donations to the Liberal party. The first dixer is on how amazing the government’s bushfire response was. Biggest take away – Scott Morrison really, really wants to be able to brand the past few months ‘Black summer’. It’s up to you if you let him. Just a reminder that Scott Morrison put out what was basically a Liberal party ad as the climate fires reached their zenith – but is now accusing the opposition of politicising the bushfires. Anthony Albanese kicks off the first question time of the year with a question on why Scott Morrison didn’t call together Coag when the fire emergency began in November: Why did the prime minister summarily dismiss Labor’s constructive proposals by rejecting a national approach to the crisis saying, “Coag might meet later”, quote, “should the need arise”. Morrison: I am sure the House won’t be surprised that I don’t accept the leader of the opposition’s characterisation of these issues. What I can tell the House ... I can tell the House is that government’s response to the national bushfire emergency over this black summer has been, Mr Speaker, unprecedented. Unprecedented with the compulsory callout of the defence force reserves, which is the first time, Mr Speaker, the first time that has occurred in the response to a national disaster of this kind. (Kevin Rudd called in the reserves, but it was not compulsory.) In addition to that, Mr Speaker, we moved quickly to establish the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and to appoint Andrew Colvin, the former head of the Australian federal police, which I thought those opposite supported these measures, but they come in here on the first question of the day, and seek to politicise the bushfire response. Now I find that disappointing. I’m happy to inform the member that we not only provided additional support for aerial firefighting assets. That is the waterbombers. But we actually provided a further $20m ... Albanese interjects on relevance, but Morrison is allowed to go on. Morrison: We provided the additional funding for those waterbombers and then we provided additional funding on top of that in response to the requests from the fire chiefs, who had sought that additional support. They sought one extra. We provided four extra, Mr Speaker. I note the constant interjecting from the leader of the opposition. And he’s been very chatty on this issue today. ... I would have thought he would be supporting these measures. If he wants to politicise bushfires, that reflects more on him than it does on the government. We might see Peter Dutton for the first time since the summer began. First we have a few condolence motions to get through. Question time is due to begin. Labor, led by Kristina Keneally on this, has responded to Christian Porter’s announcement the commonwealth parental leave scheme (12 months unpaid leave) will now include premature and stillborn babies – but it is hoping the private sector gets on board. Parents of stillborn babies already have the same access to paid parental leave under the commonwealth scheme. These changes mean parents who devastatingly lose a child due to stillbirth or infant death will be entitled to a maximum of 12 months unpaid leave. However – whilst there has been some progress – too many private companies have yet to make both these changes. The bipartisan Senate Stillbirth Inquiry recommended changes to both the Fair Work Act and the National Employment Standards to provide consistency across all employers and employees in Australia. Labor looks forward to the government making these amendments. Last year the Senate also passed a motion calling for the equalisation of bereavement payments for parents who experience a stillbirth. Currently, parents are only eligible for this payment if a baby’s heart beats after birth. If it beats once, you receive a payment, if your baby is born without a heartbeat, you don’t. It’s only fair that the bereavement payment for parents of stillborn children is equal. Likewise, it is only fair for subsequent stillborn baby payments for subsequent stillbirths to be equal. We look forward to the government making these announcements in the near future. Stillbirth is the biggest cause of infant death in our country today and the rate of death from stillbirth is higher than the national road toll. We must do everything to support families through the devastation of such heartbreak. Labor’s social team has been hard at work this morning It is just before question time, where MPs make 90-second statements. Every single Labor MP is speaking on the sports grants affair. All of them. I missed this, this morning – but it’s a new contender for favourite quote of the day. Michael McCormack was asked about how close the leadership spill vote count was yesterday (11-10 if you believe Barnaby Joyce’s camp, 15-6 if you believe McCormack’s, with the truth, as always, probably somewhere in the middle) and he had this to say: Just how close I am not sure. It is National party convention not to reveal the votes and at the end of the day, the votes do not count. What counts, for me, is regional Australians. At the end of the day, the VOTES DO NOT COUNT. Mate. The votes obviously count, because they are the whole reason you are still in your fricking job. Ladies and gentlemen: Australia’s deputy (and sometimes acting) prime minister. Long may he beige. It seems John Alexander has learned a few things since last year when he said this about our pacific neighbours (this is not a criticism, merely noting that he has actually moved on this issue and that’s a good thing): Speaking at a forum last week, Alexander reportedly noted Frank Bainimarama’s repeated call for Australia to stop burning coal and developing new coalmines but said the priority should be to help people to move their settlements to higher ground. According to Nine newspapers, he said: ‘It’s very much like your house is on fire, your children are in the house – should you call the fire brigade and get the children out of the house?’ The Bennelong MP later told ABC radio his point was that adaptation was a priority but ‘we must also act to prevent further damage to our planet’. For those who missed the speech: Pretty sure David Littleproud doesn’t have a degree in agriculture or emergency services either, and yet he managed to accept those concepts pretty easily. Bushfires and drought are weighing on an already sluggish Australian economy, while the coronavirus epidemic may inflict further pain, the Reserve Bank governor says. Speaking to the National Press Club in Sydney, Philip Lowe also defended the bank’s decision to cut official interest rates to a historic low of 0.75% against charges that it has spooked consumers into closing their wallets. Instead, Australians were adapting to a period of consistently low wages growth, high household debt and a fall in home prices by paying down their mortgages instead of going to the shops, he said. He said the economy was going through “a gentle turning point for the better”, predicting modest increases in growth and consumer spending over the coming two years. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. Lowe said the economic impact on bushfire areas was “very large” due to the “large-scale destruction of homes, farms and businesses as well as public infrastructure”. He said that, taking into account the expected rebuilding effort, government grants and insurance payouts, the fires would not affect economic growth across the whole year. However, the fires would cut economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points in the December quarter and the current quarter. He said the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy could be worse than that of the 2003 Sars epidemic because “China is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia”. Labor has just called for a quorum in the house of representatives. There are not enough government MPs in the house. It is a very busy week for Philip Lowe. If you are following the coronavirus story, you may have already seen this, but it seems not just China is annoyed at Australia now: The New Zealand foreign minister, Winston Peters, said Australian officials did not ask to use Auckland base for quarantining. We didn’t make the offer because the Australians had already said what they wanted us to do. We’re a small country doing the best we can with lesser resources than big countries have. John Alexander was making his condolence speech on the fires (the leftover ones have moved to the federation chamber). Here is what he had to say: The elephant in the room, of course, is climate change. Today is a day for commemoration, not politics. But one thing I would like to say is the need to recognise that these fires are not a warning about climate change – they are climate change. The leader of the opposition said that ‘this is not normal’. I fear this is actually the new normal. In focusing on saving this country for our grandchildren, we risk forgetting we need to save our neighbours. We must obviously mitigate future risks and change our ways, but we also must adapt because these longer, hotter summers will be our new normal. If we are to be a mature nation, we must be proactive in adapting our local infrastructure and the way we live, lest we risk succumbing to this new normal. Let’s remember Alexander is saying this at the same time the prime minister isn’t budging on anything other than “not being bullied” into something no one is bullying him on, and Barnaby Joyce – one of the most vocal members of the Coalition party room – is dumping all over wind power, because windmills look bad. Maybe JA should have another chat to his leader, given this was Scott Morrison on the Nine Network this morning: And it’s important to listen to everybody but take people forward on practical, balanced action that doesn’t go and write people’s jobs off, or industries off; that doesn’t go and put taxes on people. I mean, action on climate change does not mean taxing people. It’s about technology, not taxation. So we won’t be bullied into higher taxes or higher electricity prices. What we’ll do is take practical action that deals with these challenges. And that challenge is living in a hotter, drier and longer summer where these risk of these bushfires we need to be more resilient to. So I’m going to focus on the stuff that works – the stuff that actually reduces risk and the stuff that ensures that people can be safer in summer. Who on Lizzo’s green earth is bullying the prime minister into higher taxes? The man has been part of a government which has been in power since 2013. He was literally in charge of the treasury decisions for a decent chunk of that. He now leads the government and decides its policies, including taxes. Which he cut. It’s like saying Grandpa Joe was actually bedridden. Liberal MP John Alexander was just in the federation chamber (where speeches go to die) talking about climate change. This is noteworthy, because he was speaking about how the bushfires are actually climate change in action and present the danger of Australia’s “new normal” if action isn’t taken. Meanwhile, in the Coalition party room, there are many, many members still arguing about how climate change isn’t an issue in their electorates. And then we get to the truly Barnaby: We have to recognise that the public acceptance of wind towers on the hill in front of their veranda is gone, and the public dissonance on that issue is as strong as any other environmental subject. We have to understand that there is no sure thing in a political debate. If zero emissions are the goal then surely nuclear energy should be supported, but it is not. If wind towers are a moral good and environmentally inoffensive, why can’t we have them just off the beach at Bondi so we can feel good about ourselves while going for a surf? It would cause a riot. Do you want a 3,000ha solar farm next door to you? Lots of glass and aluminium neatly in rows pointing at the sun. I am not sure others will want to buy that view off you when you go to sell your house! The weather has determined the political climate and everyone is manipulating the recent calamitous events to push their own particular barrow. Whether there is unanimity of people’s political views on the fire ground or feeding stock in drought as to what we can do to change the weather is as unlikely as to unanimity to their favourite song. When politicians do stand behind a global climate policy, the only certainty is that it will be the policy that has the least direct effect on them. Wind farms are for your backyard not mine, zero emission nuclear is for France, only support banning coal mines if the coal mines aren’t in your electorate, and try not to get caught on a sticky question of what replaces our nation’s largest export. There is a desire for intermittent power generation such as solar but an inability to afford the pump hydro to make it dispatchable. Simple answers are generally wrong. So 2020 has started with quite some colour politically and tragedy nationally. The art form of politics will be the cogent response that the parliament can show the Australian people in two years’ time. Barnaby Joyce goes on: Now, my first attentions go back to where they were before this week: the New England, drought, fires and now the threat of coronavirus. We arrive now at the period two years prior to the next election. This period is vital in setting the agenda that the Australian people will make their judgement on as to whether we remain with the reigns of the nation in two years’ time after the next election. There is difficulty in standing behind a promise; it is so much easier to stand beside delivery if you want to get re-elected. I have disdain when the term “learnings” is used. Leaning is a verb, knowledge is a noun and “learnings” is nonsense. The knowledge we have attained from the bushfires and drought has to further develop our policy of building resilience into the future. As a government we have to deliver on what we have learnt from these natural disasters and be standing beside them by the time of the next election. For fires, better access to reliable water supplies to fight fires, clearing of road corridors to get access in and out safely to the fire grounds, communication facilities that can stand the challenge of fires, hazard reduction and upgrade of fire trails. This is to name but a few. If you want a macro climate policy to show the world our leadership on reducing carbon emissions then we must bring in nuclear power and development of the most efficient coal power technology that uses the least units of coal for the greatest output of power. Wanting to develop the most efficient coal fired power technology in the world is not disavowing the realities of climate change, it is actually something that could be provided to substantially curtail emissions. Michael McCormack in the SMH and the Age today: I didn’t get blasted out. You always take learnings. I’ll take on board what my colleagues said [but] I don’t agree necessarily with everything the media has written about this latest attempt. Barnaby Joyce has a few things to say on Facebook: Firstly I would like to congratulate Michael McCormack on winning the leadership ballot and by so doing acknowledge the re-endorsement of his position as leader of the Nationals party. It is appropriate that if a political issue needs resolving to put aside contentions held by some, a process is there to allow the clearing of the air. That process has been followed and the issue is finalised. Our nation does not have a president nor are we cursed with a tyrant. We have a free media, transparency in government and as recent events have shown, problems don’t happen with such things as sports grants that you will not later hear of in the public forum. One of the conditions of this freedom in our nation is the capacity for members of parliament to challenge their political office holders, if so desired, in the party room. For the Nationals this process was made as brief as possible, prior to the first sitting of parliament for the year. There was a spill of positions, I stood and I lost. I respect and support the vote of the room and will strive for the re-election of a Morrison McCormack government. (You may remember Michael McCormack hit out at the media yesterday, in his “everything is fine, I’m not angry, you’re angry” press conference immediately after the spill.) Scott Morrison on why he has set up a permanent commission looking into veterans’ mental health and not a royal commission: There were many issues to consider. I didn’t think a one-off review into the past informs enough, because the challenge we have is ongoing, each and every single day. A royal commission that looked into those past cases was not enough. Because, sadly, we know there will be more. We needed a solution. We needed a response that was ongoing. If you go to any RSL around the country, you will see the plaque ‘the price of peace is eternal vigilance’. We must be eternally vigilant about the welfare and care of those who’ve served in uniform, even more so when they leave their service and they leave the protection and supports that often exist within our defence forces and they go on to the next phase of their life. And let me stress this: those men and women go off to lead successful, vibrant, positive, major-contributing lives. Let’s not for a second conflate the issue and the tragedy of the terrible outcomes of veterans’ suicide with the suggestion that veterans are broken. They’re not. They’re champions. They’re heroes. But some struggle. Some are in a daily battle. And they’re the veterans that we have in mind here in the announcements that we’re making today. Anthony Albanese: You don’t get to say that you’re drawing a line under an issue just because you say it’s over. This government is shambolic. It’s moving from one mess to another, whether it’s the challenge yesterday of Barnaby Joyce to the deputy prime minister’s leadership, and then a ballot for deputy leader of the National party on a day that we were supposed to be devoting to the bushfire crisis. That underlined what is an ongoing theme of this government – that it’s all concerned about itself and politics and not concerned about the national interest. This morning I attempted to move in the parliament a debate which would see those organisations where volunteers spent hundreds of hours putting in applications in good faith, thinking that there was a level playing field, thinking that there was a fair umpire and that umpire was called Sports Australia, under the legislation in which this $100m was allocated, and finding out something very different. Finding out this was a match that was fixed from the beginning. Match fixing that went to not just Bridget McKenzie, who has been thrown under the bus. They had the prime minister’s office staff sitting in Bridget McKenzie’s office. They had emails that clearly link the prime minister’s office to the decisions asking that grants be given to clubs that didn’t get as high a score as those clubs which received. I mean, here you have quite a farce. Don Farrell: I’m here with the leader today to report to you the decision by Bridget McKenzie to resign doesn’t mean it’s the end of the sports rorts scandal that we’ve seen over the January period. Our intention this afternoon is to move in the Senate for an inquiry into what’s gone on here. We wish to investigate what the minister did, the relationship between her office and that of the prime minister, and to find out why there was no accountability and no transparency in the awarding of these grants. Thousands of clubs made applications to what they thought was a dinky-di process, an on-the-level process. What they found was that it was nothing of the sort, and they had no chance right from the start of getting any of the money. We believe we’ve got the support of the crossbench for the Senate inquiry, and one way or another, we’ll get to the bottom of what’s happened here and we’ll get some accountability, some transparency into this grants process, to make sure that this never happens again. Labor is also calling for the clubs who missed out on grants to get the money (which doesn’t actually fix the problem). Don Farrell is trying very hard to lead a press conference and, well, there may be a reason why Don Farrell doesn’t get to lead press conferences very often. On the failed division Labor called on the sports grants affair, all the independents voted with the opposition (except for Bob Katter, who was not in the chamber, because it is a day ending in y and there are enemies to be slain somewhere, or something). I mean, is that something a prime minister actually has to learn? Really? TO ALWAYS SHOW UP? FFS. What has Scott Morrison learned about leadership over the summer? Always to listen, always show up and always put Australians first. And Gladys Liu is officially out of the freezer, with a special mention from the prime minister. Scott Morrison: I want to say thank you to the Australian Chinese community. I want to say in particular thank you to Gladys Liu, who has been a leader in getting information to people on this issue and providing them support in her community down there in Box Hill. I know that’s being done by other members. We then get some damage control in terms of China, which yesterday, quite publicly, said it was annoyed at Australia’s response to the coronavirus outbreak (shutting the borders). Scott Morrison: Can I say thank you to the Australian Chinese community – you are magnificent. The way you have supported each other, the way you have acted in such a responsible fashion, on occasions with great provocation, which I’ve found reprehensible. You are observing and taking so seriously your responsibilities, together with all Australians, to ensure that we’ve been so far quite successfully able to contain the impact of the coronavirus within Australia. We have 13 confirmed cases, three of which have now left hospital and gone about their lives. So we’ve actually seen a net reduction in recent times of those cases, so I say to the Chinese community in Australia: thank you, thank you for the way that you have engaged. The whole point of the quite proactive decisions that the government has taken in relation to containing the coronavirus – and we moved so much more before many other countries – was to ensure that Australians could go about their daily lives, and going about your daily lives means going where you’d normally go, because Australians are taking the necessary precautions, and that includes our Chinese community. On the question of Australia going carbon neutral, Scott Morrison says: I’ll give you the same response I gave you at the Press Club a week ago. That’s a matter – the 2050 request that we undertook to look at in our commitment through the PIF process, and that’s what I intend to do. What I said was I would never make a commitment like that if I couldn’t tell the Australian people what it would cost them. And I wouldn’t make a commitment like that if I couldn’t tell them what it would cost them. I don’t believe the action you need to take in this area is about putting taxes on people, putting their electricity prices up or driving industries out of regional areas ... That’s what I took to the last election, that’s what Australians endorsed, and that’s what I’ll do as prime minister. My daily correspondence with the AFP has been completed – it has still not decided whether or not to investigate Angus Taylor. Scott Morrison’s press conference is back on. It’s on the new commission on veteran suicide prevention. It was Stuart Robert who shut down that motion, fyi. I think we can all guess what Labor’s 90-second statements will be on. If you want to know where question time will go (apart from the climate fires), here is what Anthony Albanese managed to get out before his motion was shut down by the government: I move that so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the leader of the opposition from moving the following motion – that the House calls on the government to fund all projects recommended by Sport Australia under the community sport infrastructure program but not funded by the Morrison government. The Sports rorts saga characterises everything that’s wrong about this government. A government [that] doesn’t represent the Australian people. A government that’s obsessed just by representing its own interests. This is a corrupt scandal that goes to the very top. This is a win – and a bipartisan one at that. Kristina Keneally made this one of her big priorities when entering the Senate, and I am glad to see the change. From Christian Porter’s release: The Morrison government will improve parental leave entitlements to help support families dealing with traumatic situations such as stillbirths, infant deaths and premature births. ‘The government understands how devastating losing a child can be and recognises that the current entitlement to just six weeks of guaranteed unpaid parental leave is insufficient for many parents who need more time before they return to work,’ attorney general and minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said. ‘That is why we want to increase the entitlement for those who’ve experienced a stillbirth or infant death to a maximum of 12 months – the same amount of unpaid leave parents of healthy babies can access. ‘While not all parents will want to use the full 12 months, it is important that the option is available to them should they need it.’ For parents of premature babies, or babies that experience birth-related complications that result in immediate hospitalisation, the government will also remove the barrier that currently prevents parents from going back to work and restarting their leave when their baby is ready to go home ... Parents will be allowed to use up to 30 days (six weeks) of their 12-month unpaid leave entitlement flexibly, up to the child’s second birthday. During this time, they will also be able to choose to claim part of their 18-week paid leave entitlement. While employers and employees will remain free to agree on arrangements that suit their specific circumstances, these changes will provide Australian families with an improved minimum safety net that offers greater certainty during times of tragedy and more choices about how to structure work and family arrangements. Legislation to enact the changes to unpaid parental leave will be consulted on in the coming weeks ahead of its expected introduction to parliament in the autumn sitting period. These divisions are reminding me why I hear the lambs screaming in my sleep. A division has postponed the prime minister’s press conference – it’s a motion to suspend standing orders over the sports grants. It will fail. Anthony Albanese will hold a press conference at 11.30. It’s with Don Farrell (the shadow minister for sport – who knew?) so I think we can guess what it’s about. It’s early, but my favourite quote of the day so far is this from Scott Morrison on the Nine Network today: And we’ve got back straight on the job as we never departed from, as in the government. Because yes, war is peace. And if you want to keep a secret, best to also hide it from yourself. The prime minister will hold a press conference on the new commission at 10.30. Scott Morrison has announced an independent commissioner will look into the mental health of veterans. It will have some of the powers of a royal commission, but it’s not a royal commission. From the release: The Morrison government will establish a permanent national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention. The national commissioner will have the enduring power, scope and resources to investigate suicides and related issues as they arise, rather than being restricted by a one-off review looking at past practices. The national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention will be empowered to perform two roles: The commissioner will be an independent and permanent public accountability body, with the same powers of a royal commission to compel the production of evidence and summon witnesses, and make findings and recommendations to government. The commissioner will also provide an ongoing investigative function of individual cases of suicide, working with each state and territory coronial office, making recommendations to government. The government will invest an initial $40m to support the commissioner’s work and this will be expanded to ensure they have whatever resources they need. The government will also establish an immediate, independent review of historical veteran suicide cases, conducted by the commissioner, focusing on the impact of military service and veterans’ post-service experience. An interim report will be delivered within 12 months. Families will be engaged in this process if they wish, with an opportunity to participate and tell their stories openly and safely. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, along with coronial and legal experts, will provide technical expertise in support of this work. Thank you to AAP for this summary: WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FEDERAL POLITICS? Scott Morrison has announced an inquiry into veteran suicide with the powers of a royal commission. The prime minister has promised a national inquiry into the bushfire season will be finished by August. Nationals MPs Darren Chester and Keith Pitt are expected to be elevated to cabinet in a ministerial reshuffle. The junior coalition partner is also trying to move on from a failed coup against Michael McCormack launched by former leader Barnaby Joyce. Legislation is being debated in both houses of parliament for the first time this year, after Tuesday was taken up with tributes to bushfire victims. Labor is expected to pursue the sports rorts scandal during question time on Wednesday. The government is also expected to cop questions over its response to the bushfires. Climate protesters continue their action outside Parliament House. It’s been announced Indonesian president Joko Widodo will address parliament next week. Given that we are going to hear “meet and beat” a lot in terms of emissions targets, it is worth having a listen to this Full Story podcast from Adam Morton: Is the Australian government really ‘meeting and beating’ its emissions reduction targets? Scott Morrison regularly claims Australia is ‘meeting and beating’ its emissions reduction targets. But is that true? In this episode of Full Story, environment editor Adam Morton explains why we should focus less on targets and more on emissions. So what can we expect today, given that parliament is officially back and the climate fires have been acknowledged? Well, probably an end to what has been described as the “sombre bipartisanship” between Labor and the Coalition. Awwwwww. I bet he still believes in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy and that the Great Barrier Reef can be saved too! Here’s Scott Morrison on Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals on the Nine Network this morning: Morrison: I was happy to see the Nationals deal with these matters as quickly as possible, as they did, so we could get the focus very quickly back on to the importance of yesterday, which was to honour certainly, and firstly, those who lost their lives in these terrible fires. And many of the families of those who’d fallen in Australia’s name were able to be there and get that comfort and support. But also to honour all of those who certainly continue to serve to this day, that Michael McCormack has made it clear this morning that he, you know, he’s apologised, that there was that event yesterday morning, but they dealt with it quickly. And we’ve got back straight on the job as we never departed from, as in the government. Host: I mean, it was an ugly distraction yesterday. Prime minister, you know he’ll be back. Morrison: No, he said he’s not challenging again. So I think that issues - Host: Because that never happens in politics. Morrison: Well, look, the media might want to talk about it, but I think Barnaby ruled a line under that pretty clearly yesterday. So we just get on with the job, which is what Australians expect us to do. An Air New Zealand evacuation flight has left Wuhan carrying a total of 193 passengers: 100 New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, 23 Australian citizens and 70 foreign nationals, predominantly from Pacific Island countries including Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. On board the flight is one doctor and two paramedics from St John. When the flight arrives in Auckland at 6.30pm today, the Australian passengers will be directly transferred to a flight bound to Australia, while the New Zealanders and other nationalities will be quarantined for two weeks at Whangaparaoa airbase. The bells are ringing. May Lizzo have mercy on my decaffeinated soul. When I say Australia is wayyyyyyyyy behind on the climate conversation, I mean really, really behind. Like Warwick Capper-runs-for-politics levels of behind. Here is Boris Johnson overnight: I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,” Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. We’re going to do it by 2050, we’re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let’s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve man-made climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren. He worked out it was a parody account. Still, I appreciate the wholesomeness. Still on Michael McCormack, who is desperately attempting to go from whitebread to at least sourdough in an attempt to keep his job beyond the next six months – he was asked about his new deputy David Littleproud’s comments on 7.30 last night regarding Bridget McKenzie and the sports grants affair. As Paul Karp reported: Asked if it was right for the former sports minister to hand grants out according to a spreadsheet colour-coded by the party holding the electorate in which it was located, Littleproud replied: “Well, obviously I don’t think that necessarily getting as partisan as that is the best way to do it.” McCormack, though, is sticking to the report which cleared it – the PM&amp;C report written by Scott Morrison’s former chief of staff Phil Gaetjens (who was also Peter Costello’s former chief of staff), despite the independent auditor general’s report raising some very serious questions over the process. Added bonus – we don’t get to see the Gaetjen’s report, because it is cabinet-in-confidence, and as such will be locked up for 20 years. So we only have what the prime minister says it said, and we are told that is enough and every Coalition MP is using that as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Again, don’t you worry about that. Anyway, it is all fine, says McCormack, because every one of the clubs which got money was eligible: We can take learnings from what the report has decreed. Phil Gaetjens has also said, the secretary, that there was no bias towards targeted or marginal seats. He has said that. And yes, we can take learnings from what the ANAO report has said, and from Mr Gaetjens and what he’s also found – no bias. All projects eligible, and I’m proud of the fact that we’ve got a set of books which are balanced, which are coming into surplus, and which provide the ability for the government, through the expenditure review process, through the budget process, to be able to fund even more rounds of these programs. Particularly important for regional Australia. And let me tell you, when you’re out in regional Australia and you’re a young woman and you’re wanting to play netball or AFLW or soccer or whatever the case may be, you shouldn’t have to be getting dressed behind a car. You shouldn’t have to be getting dressed behind a tree. You should be able to have the same sorts of facilities that the boys have always enjoyed. And that’s what I’m particularly pleased about with this program. Well done to Bridget McKenzie for doing just that. Reminder: we have no idea what Gaetjens has said. The spreadsheet was colour-coded according to party. It targeted marginal seats and those the Coalition wanted. And talking points are not policy. Mike Bowers has just walked into the building. I’ve sent him for coffee. I mean, even putting aside BlackRock’s announcement it was getting out of thermal coal investment – which, as the largest fund manager in the world is a pretty big deal – because you know that’s absolutely a financial decision, let’s remember that we seem to be the only democracy in the world still arguing over this stuff. Everyone else has moved on. And yet our politics still has us mired in the muck of “but the jobs”, which is exactly the same argument which has been used in every single other massive change (tobacco advertising bans anyone?) and the country has not only survived – new industries have created new jobs. We are seeing it all over the world. Except for here. Much like someone who mistakes loud tropical shirts as a personality, Michael McCormack has decided that talking VERY LOUDLY about coal will substitute for policy and solutions. In response to questions from Michael Rowland on ABC Breakfast about Anglo American (a massive mining company) chief executive Mark Cutifani’s comments about climate change as well as his announcement he wants out of thermal coal in the next five years (which is also an economic decision, let’s be real), McCormack said: Fantastic, good on him. And he’s probably done very nicely, thank you very much, out of the coal industry. Very, very nicely, and – but coal is providing for two-thirds of Australia’s energy needs, power needs, it’s providing for $62bn of exports, it’s providing 55,000 jobs. We are a government which is looking at all forms of technology to be able to power this country. I’m glad that we have just gone into an agreement with New South Wales. We need to use more gas, we need to actually get more gas and put it into the system. I know that Angus Taylor and others are doing very hard – working very hard to make sure that we bring power prices down for Australians, that’s one of the most important things for them – is their energy bill and making sure that it’s affordable. That’s what we’re doing. Samantha Maiden of the New Daily has an update on Scott Morrison’s Hawaiian holiday – you’ll never learn how much it cost taxpayers. Voters will never be told the taxpayer cost of the Scott Morrison’s private holidays to Fiji and Hawaii, including flying AFP officers overseas to guard his family, after a freedom of information request was dismissed on the grounds it was not in the public interest and could harm international relations. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has exempted all documents relating to the controversial trip that Mr Morrison took to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia, effectively slapping a suppression order on the taxpayer cost. While the prime minister paid for the flights privately, there was a taxpayer cost incurred in flying security guards overseas for the family trip, a highly unusual act by a national leader. You can read that report, here. Michael McCormack was on Sky this morning, promising his party will focus on its constituents from now on. You know – those people who are among the poorest in the country, and have suffered through one of the worst droughts this nation has seen, as well as the climate fires, and water issues, and continued simmering trade tensions in an already shaky economy. Those constituents. I appreciate that yesterday was probably necessary to take place, it has taken place. Barnaby has pledged his loyalty, he said he won’t re-challenge. We now need to draw a line under it and move on and make sure as members of the National party we concentrate on the people who matter most, and that’s the people we serve. Pretty sure we have heard that before. Parliament is due to start at 9.30am this morning. As promised in the government talking points, we have legislation – the government will be putting through a treasury laws amendment (to ensure the bushfire assistance is tax-free) as well as two more bills related to the banking royal commission, which was handed down about a year ago. It’s the first official day of parliamentary proceedings – which you can tell, because every politician and their dog has been on the breakfast TV shows this morning, telling us it is a brand new year. Let’s try and forget for a moment that the ridiculous drama of yesterday was entirely brought on by the National party itself, and had nothing to do with anyone or anything else – you don’t get to “draw a line” under something just because you decide it’s over. Scott Morrison has been out this morning talking about the new frontbench coming – as well as the independent commissioner into veteran suicides. Darren Chester will be returning to the cabinet – that much is sure. Keith Pitt will probably get a guernsey as well – he is steady, hasn’t screwed up his media appearances, and well, Michael McCormack owes him. Michelle Landry is also in line for a promotion – she was a steadfast McCormack supporter since his leadership emergence two years ago, and didn’t budget. David Littleproud will also most likely get what he wants. But all of that doesn’t change that the government doesn’t get to “draw a line” under the summer – and what’s happened since they got back – just because they want to. The sports grants affair, the Nationals, the coming audits, Angus Taylor, the response to the climate fires, water, the economy – all of that doesn’t go away, just because someone wants to get a stick out and draw a line under something. You have one-coffee Amy (hence the crankiness), Sarah Martin and Paul Karp with you today – with Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers working off-site. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2016/nov/14/lucy-kirkwood-the-children-royal-court-theatre-chimerica","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-14T07:00:41Z","webTitle":"Chimerica playwright Lucy Kirkwood: 'The whole of democracy looks fragile and farcical'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/14/lucy-kirkwood-the-children-royal-court-theatre-chimerica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2016/nov/14/lucy-kirkwood-the-children-royal-court-theatre-chimerica","fields":{"headline":"Chimerica playwright Lucy Kirkwood: 'The whole of democracy looks fragile and farcical'","bodyText":"Women who go to see a Lucy Kirkwood play may find themselves unknowingly serving as production consultants.

I was hoping to be home for Grand Designs!” It made the writer panic, but the production transferred to the West End and won four best play awards. Whatever the lavatorial feedback on The Children, about to open at the Royal Court in London, Kirkwood has been unusually thoughtful to her audience with the choice of title. Few were sure how to pronounce Chimerica (the first syllable, she says, should rhyme with whine not him), while no one could remember the name of It Felt Empty When the Heart Went at First But It Is Alright Now, her breakthrough play about sex trafficking. So is The Children a deliberately simple baptism? “Yes. The Royal Court box office rang me up in tears and pleaded with me,” she jokes. “No. But the first line of the play is, ‘How are the children?’ And so, when it came to the title, I did think, ‘Why not make it easier for the poor bloody people who have to put the play on?’” Arriving at the Court with long hair blown by the first winds of winter and carrying a big bunch of wild flowers, Kirkwood, 33, looks as if she has come to rehearse for Ophelia’s big scene in Hamlet. The flowers, a gift for her grandmother, were picked at home in Norfolk before she travelled to London for a few days to watch rehearsals for The Children and attend a read-through of another new play, Mosquitoes, which opens in July at the National. After a success as big as Chimerica, writers often become frozen or panicky about works in progress. “There wasn’t ever a conscious panic about following it,” Kirkwood says. “I’m very grateful that it happened to me relatively late – not that I’m ancient, but it didn’t happen out of the gate. If it happens with a first play, I can understand that causing a panic. But I did notice that I have become quite slow in wanting to finish these two new plays and hand them over.” There was a time when playwrights with a big success – such as Tom Stoppard and John Osborne – moved to a mansion in the country, but Kirkwood says Chimerica did more for her profile than her purse: “It was a very expensive production. If it had run longer, I might be able to take you out to lunch. So no mansion. But I have a Victorian labourer’s cottage that I’m happy with.” The fluent rhythm and wit of Kirkwood’s conversation make clear where her characters get their spiky, imagistic dialogue from. Of the first dramas she wrote as a student at Edinburgh University, she says: “I would hesitate to call them plays, but they were definitely dialogue-based lifeforms.” Getting stuck during the composition of a play resembles “trying to put on a wet swimming costume: it won’t go with you”. Seeing actors working on scripts in rehearsal is “like opening your fridge and finding a parmesan rind, and then someone makes you a risotto out of it”. Key ingredients of both her new plays are female scientists. Mosquitoes features two sisters involved with the Large Hadron Collider experiments in particle physics. In The Children, three nuclear scientists reunite at a teetering seaside cottage after a disaster at a power station. One theme of the latter is parental instinct – choosing to be childless, or having children you can’t love or who don’t love you. This seems to reflect a social phenomenon of the cold war: people choosing not to have children because of fears about the world they would inhabit. “Yes,” says Kirkwood. “My dad wasn’t going to have children originally for that reason.” Did he tell you? “No, my nana told me. But I did talk to him about it. Along with: would you rather have had a boy? Because there’s just me and my sister. I think those are really interesting questions in families.” She stresses, though, that the sibling relationship in Mosquitoes “definitely isn’t about me and my sister. Although my family always think it’s about them even when it isn’t.” She grew up on the borders of Essex and London, her father an investment analyst and her mother a signer for deaf students. Her parents’ keen theatregoing seeded her vocation: “The very first time I was interviewed, I said the first play I had ever seen was Alan Bennett’s adaptation of The Wind in the Willows at the National. But it got printed as my favourite play, which was pretty devastating for a radical young dramatist. It was brilliant, though. I remember going to school the next day and trying to make a revolving stage.” Having given up maths and physics at school as soon as she could, Kirkwood is slightly surprised at the current scientific direction of her writing, but she consciously approaches the material as a non-expert. Noting the online speculation that switching on the Large Hadron Collider might cause the end of the world, she wanted Mosquitoes to deal with “the fear of science and how lay people react to science”. But in the post-apocalyptic scenario of The Children, such concerns seem to have been justified. “Yes. That’s true. Although the play for me was never meant to be an examination of the ins and outs of nuclear power and whether that’s the right way forward.” She sees the older nuclear power stations – built with science and requirements that prove inadequate today – as a wider metaphor for the problems of dealing with social and political inheritances. Across her first decade as a playwright, Kirkwood’s work displays trademarks of strong narrative – “I came to realise that Chimerica is really a thriller” – and, in common with the work of her theatrical heroine Caryl Churchill, an intense attempt to approximate on stage the way people really speak. Kirkwood’s characters get speeches containing sudden gaps, stammering repeats or switchbacks that give a delayed answer to an earlier question. She points out that the versions of her answers that appear in this piece will have been purged of the mistakes, false trails and hesitations, with the result that her theory of dialogue now reads: “Very few people in life speak aloud in spontaneous perfectly formed certainties – and I’m suspicious of those who do – and so to me dialogue without hesitations, overlaps, repetitions, loops and mistakes draws attention to its ‘written-ness’. It’s a bit like how in a good costume department they don’t just give an actor a coat, they age and weather and scuff up and dirty the coat until it feels like the character has actually worn it. Because a new coat on stage jumps out a mile.” Her first five performed plays – from 2008’s Tinderbox, a 21st-century dystopia, to Chimerica – are published this month in an anthology, and the playwright found it agonising to revisit the scripts: “It’s like reading a teenage diary. You’re mortified by what you were like. Anything of mine I read from the past I find excruciating. I was itching to rewrite, but I had to be very strict with myself. You have to be honest about the writer you were at the time.” Between the opening of The Children and rehearsals for Mosquitoes, she hopes to complete a four-part drama, potentially for Channel 4, that extends Chimerica’s investigation of contemporary politics; it’s set during the year of the Brexit and Trump victories. “The whole of democracy looks fragile and farcical. After writing about communist China in Chimerica, you suddenly look at western democracy and think: is this necessarily better? Maybe this is the endgame.” • The Children is at the Royal Court, London, from 17 November until 14 January. Mosquitoes opens at the National Theatre in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2017/jul/11/brexit-weekly-briefing-embattled-theresa-may-concedes-she-needs-help","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-11T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: embattled Theresa May concedes she needs help","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/11/brexit-weekly-briefing-embattled-theresa-may-concedes-she-needs-help","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jul/11/brexit-weekly-briefing-embattled-theresa-may-concedes-she-needs-help","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: embattled Theresa May concedes she needs help","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as the UK heads to the EU door marked “exit”.

If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture Whether Theresa May’s attempt to relaunch her premiership will work is anyone’s guess, but her unlikely appeal to Labour and other parties to “come forward with your own views and ideas” is at least an acknowledgement that the embattled prime minister will need help to deliver Brexit. It’s no accident that her speech on Tuesday comes as the government is on the point of publishing its repeal bill, which will reverse the 1972 European Communities Act, transfer EU statutes wholesale into British law, adopt EU standards – and leave ministers with powers to amend it all later without parliamentary scrutiny. Rebel Tory and Labour MPs, along with Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru, have formed a cross-party group to lead parliamentary opposition to a hard Brexit and see the bill as their first opportunity to do so. Chuka Umunna, who led the Labour rebellion against leaving the single market, said: We won’t accept MPs being treated as spectators in the Brexit process ... We will be fighting in parliament for a future relationship with the EU that protects our prosperity and rights at work. Among further challenges to the government’s full-bore Brexit objective of leaving both the single market and the customs union, Philip Hammond insisted people wanted a “sensible Brexit” and warned “it would be madness” not to seek “the closest possible arrangement” with the bloc. The chancellor’s remarks followed a punchy intervention from UK business leaders, who demanded ministers agree an indefinite delay to Britain’s exit from the single market and customs union to allow more time for talks on a long-term trade deal. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-General of the CBI, said: This is a time to be realistic. Instead of a cliff edge, the UK needs a bridge to the new EU deal. Even with the greatest possible goodwill on both sides, it’s impossible to imagine the detail will be clear by the end of March 2019. Adding to the prime minister’s woes, at least nine Conservative MPs reportedly reject the government’s plans to withdraw from Euratom, saying leaving the European atomic energy community could harm the UK’s nuclear power industry and put cancer patients at risk. Dominic Cummings, the director of Vote Leave, said it would be moronic. The view from Europe More Brexit home truths came Britain’s way from Brussels last week. Michel Barnier, the European commission’s chief negotiator, reiterated that the UK could not expect to leave the EU single market and keep the benefits, or quit the customs union and expect “frictionless trade”: I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and keep all of its benefits. That is not possible ... I have heard some people in the UK argue that one can leave the single market and build a customs union to have frictionless trade. That is not possible. The decision to leave the EU has consequences. Meanwhile, Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit representative, and eight other MEPs called Britain’s offering on the rights of EU citizens in the UK “a damp squib” and threatened to veto any Brexit deal if it is not improved: We will never endorse the retroactive removal of acquired rights. The European parliament will reserve its right to reject any agreement that treats EU citizens, regardless of their nationality, less favourably than they are at present. And Pascal Lamy, a former EU commissioner and two-time head of the World Trade Organisation, warned the government not to make the “mistake” of cutting itself adrift from EU scientific programmes after Brexit. Meanwhile, back in Westminster With the the prime minister’s attempts to survive as Tory leader looking increasingly precarious, allies of David Davis, the Brexit secretary, mooted the possibility of replacing her before the party’s autumn conference. Andrew Mitchell is reported to have told a dinner of Conservative MPs that the prime minister needed to be replaced, saying May was “dead in the water ... weak, had lost her authority and couldn’t go on”. Grant Shapps, a former Conservative party chairman, criticised the dysfunctional, arrogant and corrosive attitude of May’s team before the election and said she would need to “operate a completely different model to remain in power”. May said on the way to the G20 summit in Hamburg that it had been “the right decision” to call the early election that cost her a parliamentary majority, insisting that she would push ahead with her programme for government and would be remaining in place. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn – with Labour as much as eight points clear in the polls – drew record crowds to a miners’ gala in Durham. He urged May to end the public sector pay cap, order a public inquiry into the “national catastrophe” of the Grenfell fire, abandon the Conservative “nightmare” and call a snap general election. You should also know ... Britons who commute to Europe or work short-term contracts on the continent say May’s citizens’ rights plan will leave them worse off. A traditional British breakfast could cost £3 more if the government fails to secure a trade deal with the EU. Incoming Lib Dem leader Vince Cable suspects Brexit may never happen. German car industry says the single market, not exports to UK, is top priority. Banks, insurers and fund managers have until Friday to tell the Bank of England how they plan to cope with a hard Brexit. Donald Trump told Theresa May at the G20 summit that he expects a trade deal with the UK to be completed “very, very quickly”. Paris woos London banks with lower taxes, lighter regulation and new international schools. British strawberries could cost 50% more because of Brexit, MPs told. UK faces tightest squeeze on household incomes for five years. Ministers move to allay Brexit fears over access to medicines. UK manufacturers will soon hit a “tipping point” where a lack of certainty over Brexit will force them to make cuts whatever the outcome. Read these In the Observer, Nick Cohen argues that the pre-referendum claims made for our future trading position within Europe have been exposed as hot air: Economics did not trump politics when Britain voted to leave the EU. It does not trump politics now that 27 countries are determined to preserve the union ... As German industrialists make clear, they would rather lose British sales than see the world’s richest market undermined. One Whitehall source sounded as weary as Cassandra as he described how ministers ignored the warnings of the civil service that EU countries meant it when they said we could not leave the single market and retain the benefits of being in the single market. “They think it’s just a negotiating tactic,” he told me. “They think they will buckle because EU countries export more to us than we export to them. They don’t understand or want to understand.” In the Spectator, Alex Massie seizes on the occasion of Helmut Kohl’s funeral to reflect eloquently on how the British – or most of them – have never really understood the European project: We created a political culture in which the default setting or assumption was that, while still better than the alternatives, the EU could never be anything other than intrinsically hostile to British interests. We never saw the nobility of the project because we never talked about it and, perhaps, because if we had, the British people would have laughed at such talk. Because that kind of talk ... was alien to the British people’s idea of their own history and their conception of what a European future could, or would have to, be. And at CapX, Chris Deerin takes an entertaining (if sobering) canter through all the many ways in which the government is botching Brexit – and imagines a scenario in which it could, just conceivably, not happen: Brexiteers and Remainers together, let’s admit the bleedin’ obvious: it’s not going well, is it? Let’s not pretend we’re cruising towards a generous “have cake and eat it” deal with the EU. Don’t claim the government has its act together. Don’t say that the civil service machine is humming smoothly, spooling out sophisticated proposals for how to come out on top in the negotiation process and build an exciting and shinily sleek New Britain in the aftermath. None of that is happening ... Reader, it is my duty to say it: oh shit. I have scanned the horizon for a hero riding to Brexit’s rescue and found none. I have spoken to politicians, civil servants, academics, experts both at home and abroad, and have identified an overwhelming consensus: Britain is screwed. The situation is so grim that for the first time since June 23, I wonder whether the country might rethink.

For a brief period, a record 70% of the electricity for the UK’s homes and businesses was low-carbon, as nuclear, solar and wind crowded out coal and even gas power stations. That afternoon was a glimpse into the future, of how energy provision will look in 13 years’ time because of binding carbon targets. On what one grid manager called “stunning Sunday”, the carbon intensity of producing power – a key measure of progress towards climate goals – dropped below the “magic number” of 100g of CO2 per kilowatt hour for the first time. That’s the level that must be the norm by 2030, according to the government’s climate advisers. Yet last Sunday was just one of a run of striking records for renewable power in Britain that pose profound questions for conventional generators and the companies which manage power grids. On one Friday in May, solar power briefly eclipsed the UK’s eight nuclear power stations. The grid recently went without coal for an entire day for the first time, and the dirty fuel is now regularly absent from power supply for hours at a time. These milestones are having tangible effects. Solar cuts power demand for National Grid, reducing prices, while wind power also lowers prices. That led to another first last week, when high wind output pushed down the wholesale price and resulted in negative power prices, which means some conventional power plants had to pay household suppliers like British Gas to take their electricity. “This has surprised people,” said John Feddersen, chief executive of analysts Aurora Energy Research, referring to the speed at which negative prices had arrived in the UK. In Germany, lower power prices driven by the country’s green energy boom have wiped billions off the share prices of energy giants E.ON and RWE. But will the likes of EDF and British Gas owner Centrica, which own nuclear and gas plants, face the same fate in the UK? Feddersen argues that there are two reasons why this will not happen. One is the UK’s “capacity market”, which has been set to cope with power shortages as coal plants have closed and renewables have made supplies more intermittent. A new scheme will pay conventional power station owners £378m in subsidies this winter to be on standby and ensure the lights stay on. The other is the payments from National Grid to fossil fuel plants for services that are vital to national power supply, such as “blackstart” – the ability to restart the nation’s power grid in the event of a catastrophic, widespread loss of energy supplies. Odd as it may sound, power station owners no longer make money out of power, but from these other mechanisms. “This is the new world for how the system’s meant to work in the UK. Generators know you’re not going to get your investment back in the energy market,” said Feddersen. “We won’t actually see the share-price impacts in the UK that we’ve seen in Germany,” he said. The capacity market is the main reason why. Rob Lalor, senior analyst at EnAppSys, which monitors energy supply, said: “The big difference between the UK and Germany is they’ve [conventional operators] been given the opportunity to make money [through the capacity market].” So far, the low prices seen in the UK during renewable output surges were relatively infrequent and had had limited impact, he said. But that will change as such events become more common – records will continue to be broken because of a pipeline of offshore windfarms being plugged into the grid. However, it is clear that the growth of renewables has made prices a lot spikier than they used to be. As well as low or negative prices during high wind and solar periods, prices can leap very high when wind doesn’t materialise as forecast. Day-ahead power prices in May averaged £41 per megawatt hour, but dipped just below zero early on 7 June during a period of high wind output. Prices also rose as high as nearly £83 in May. “What you see with more wind and solar in the market is a lot more volatility of prices in the day,” said Hervé Touati of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US energy research body. He has seen the same phenomenon in California, where the two technologies now play a key role in determining price. In the UK, the rise of renewables is also creating new challenges for the people who manage local and national power grids. Robert Gross, director of the centre for energy policy and technology at Imperial College, said fossil fuel plants were having to ramp up and down more quickly to adjust to wind and solar output. “My understanding is that’s not causing any insurmountable problems [for the grid]. The way I heard it characterised is the National Grid control room now finds summer to be more worrisome than January nights. Now it’s the [challenge of] solar and low demand on very sunny days [rather than high demand days in winter].” His research shows that costs for managing the grid – balancing supply and demand as the energy supply becomes more variable – will not rise prohibitively until the UK has at least twice as much wind and solar power as it does now. But for some observers, such as credit agency Moody’s, wind and solar presents a long-term risk to Europe’s energy networks. “The growing share of electricity from renewables has already had adverse effects on incumbent generators and energy networks are not immune,” it said in a report this week. But Duncan Burt, who oversees daily operations at the National Grid, is sanguine about the renewable records. “It’s one of these things where we’ve tipped through a threshold. But the work we’ve done to get ready for this has paid off,” he said, citing a grid-run scheme that encourages large energy users to increase their demand during summer periods of low demand and high wind and solar output. The UK isn’t done with records this year yet, Burt thinks, suggesting solar could go higher and carbon intensity might go even lower than the 90g CO2 per kWh last Sunday, to as low as 80g. “I think we will beat them several times this summer.” Germany’s view When Angela Merkel announced in 2011 that Germany would seek to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2022, questions arose as to whether renewable sources of energy, such as wind or solar, could grow quickly enough to meet the requirements of German industry. Yet six years later, renewable power stations across the country are producing power in such abundance that conventional providers relying on coal and gas are being squeezed out of the market, and the state has to pay some renewable energy companies to switch off their turbines to stop congesting the power grid. On one particularly sunny but windy day, on 8 May 2016, a record 87.6% of Germany’s energy needs were met by renewables: an inspirational achievement, were it not for conventional power stations continuing to produce energy at their usual rate. As a knock-on effect of the oversupply, energy market prices collapsed, adding further volatility to a rapidly changing the environment for energy companies. E.ON, Germany’s biggest utility, reported a record loss of €16bn (£14bn) for 2016 and said it would have to cut around 1,300 jobs, 3% of its total workforce. The previous year, E.ON had already posted a loss of almost €7bn. Both E.ON and RWE, Germany’s second-largest electricity provider, have reacted by radically restructuring their companies, splitting their renewable business from their fossil-fuel operations and selling stakes in the new operations to investors. E.ON hived off its gas and coal power stations into an entity called Uniper at the start of 2016. RWE moved its renewables business into “RWE International” on 1 April 2016. Cries of woe from lobbyists haven’t gone unnoticed, and the future of Germany’s big energy giants could feature in the upcoming federal elections in September. Some politicians from the pro-business wing of Merkel’s Christian Democrats have called for an end to state subsidies for green energy by 2021. Providers of green energy don’t receive “subsidies” in the sense of direct payments from the state, but are guaranteed a fixed price at which they can sell energy into the grid.

Gillian Troughton, the Labour candidate, was defeated by the Conservatives’ Trudy Harrison, marking the first time a governing party has taken a seat from another party in a byelection in 35 years. The Conservatives took 13,748 votes to Labour’s 11,601 after a turnout of 51%. The Lib Dem candidate, Rebecca Hanson, came third with 2,252 votes. Troughton left the count at Cleveland Sports Centre within minutes of the dramatic result being announced and without making a concession speech. She was heckled by a passerby who shouted “Sack Corbyn!” as she was rushed into a waiting car. Harrison, a political novice, said in her victory speech: “What has happened here tonight is a truly historic event. You’d have to go back more than a century to find an example of a governing party taking a seat from the opposition party in an election like this. “We’ve had Labour here for more than 80 years but it’s been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t represent them. “They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum, and which will build a country which represents everyone. That’s why they voted for me tonight.” Labour was battling to save a slim 2,564 majority left by Jamie Reed, an outspoken Corbyn critic who quit to take a job at the local Sellafield nuclear decommissioning plant. Critics of the Labour leader will claim that his perceived hostility to nuclear was key to the defeat. The industry employs more than 10,000 people in the west Cumbrian constituency. Tory campaigners made much of an ITV Borders television interview by Corbyn at the end of January in which he failed four times to say he supported Moorside, a multi-billion pound nuclear plant planned to be built next to Sellafield. Labour’s campaign focused heavily on Tory-backed plans to close the maternity unit at the new West Cumberland hospital, meaning the nearest service will be an hour-long drive away in Carlisle. Troughton, a borough councillor, retired doctor and St John ambulance driver who voted against Corbyn in the last leadership contest, consistently claimed the hospital was the “number one issue on the doorstep”. Speaking after the result, Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish who ran Troughton’s campaign, conceded that the party “struggled to convince” voters that it backs nuclear power. “This has been one of the most polarised campaigns that I’ve ever known, centred on two issues about the worries people have about the downgrade to West Cumberland hospital,” he said. “With Gillian Troughton we had a superb candidate who put the NHS at the heart of the campaign and really did work hard on the ground to get the message out that we wanted to save those services.” Gwynne declined to answer whether Corbyn was to blame and said the Tories “threw all kinds of stuff at us on the nuclear issue and that clearly resonated with some people”. He added: “The other issue was nuclear and we struggled to convince people that the Labour party is and remains a pro-civil nuclear party committed to the Sellafield decommissioning site, but also committed very much to the new power plant at Moorside as well.” Harrison, a former Sellafield worker, told voters she was best placed to lobby ministers on the hospital and already had commitments for a government inquiry. She said road upgrades, a constant complaint by Copeland voters, would be announced by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, after the byelection. Fiona Mills, the Ukip candidate, was thought to be trailing as voters moved to the Conservatives. The byelection took an ugly twist earlier on Thursday when a Conservative MP said he had called police over abusive social media messages about his stillborn son. Will Quince, the MP for Colchester, received the stream of offensive tweets after speaking out in the row over the proposed cuts to maternity services in Copeland. The MP had earlier condemned a Labour leaflet warning that mothers and babies would die if wards were cut at the West Cumberland hospital. The MP, who has campaigned on maternity issues since his son Robert was stillborn in 2014, branded the claim “simply disgusting”. Mike Starkie, the independent elected mayor of Copeland, said he had encountered many Labour voters planning to back Harrison in the hope it would force Corbyn out as leader. “I don’t think you can blame the candidate for the loss. I think the candidate equipped herself well through the whole campaign but there is an anti-Corbyn feeling among Labour supporters in Copeland - that’s a fact,” he said. “It’s not all down to nuclear. I just don’t think Jeremy Corbyn’s particularly popular with Labour-supporting people.” Starkie added: “It’s quite a historic night. I thought it was going to be a lot closer than what it was. The margin of victory has surprised everybody. “One of the real positives of this byelection campaign is we’ve had more high-profile politicians here than we have for the whole of the last century. People are more aware of what the issues are here and what needs addressing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/21/baltic-politicians-lobbied-david-davis-only-negotiate-brexit-uk-unified-eu27","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T17:53:28Z","webTitle":"Baltic politicians lobbied by David Davis: we will only negotiate as one","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/baltic-politicians-lobbied-david-davis-only-negotiate-brexit-uk-unified-eu27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/21/baltic-politicians-lobbied-david-davis-only-negotiate-brexit-uk-unified-eu27","fields":{"headline":"Baltic politicians lobbied by David Davis: we will only negotiate as one","bodyText":"Senior European politicians lobbied by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, during a whistlestop tour of the Baltic states have insisted they will negotiate with the UK as a unified bloc, and questioned the realism of Britain’s negotiating goals. During visits to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia over the last two days, Davis told his political counterparts there that he was confident a comprehensive EU-UK free trade agreement could be struck within the two-year time frame of article 50 talks. He also emphasised Britain’s hopes of continuing to be an important military power on the continent at a time when the Baltic states are increasingly anxious about the intentions of Vladimir Putin’s Russia. However, in a series of interviews with the Guardian following the bilateral talks, those who listened to Davis have raised concerns about the feasibility of the British government’s timetable and said the EU27 is united in the goal of negotiating as one bloc. Britain has been accused by the three leaders of the main political groups in the European parliament of employing a strategy of “divide and rule” by appealing to the individual member states’ interests prior to talks, and seeking to use its military strength as a bargaining chip. The UK’s critics have said Davis should leave the negotiating for when he sits down with the European commission’s negotiator, Michel Barnier, after formal notification from Theresa May that the UK wishes to leave the EU. It is feared that the future of the EU will be threatened if a deal is struck that appeals to a majority of states’ economic and security interests but weakens the European project as a whole by encouraging others to peel away. Speaking in Tallinn after talks with Davis, Estonia’s chief Brexit negotiator, Matti Maasikas, said the chief goal of his country, which will take over the rolling presidency of the European council in July, was maintaining the “unity of the 27”. He said there had been no signs in his meeting with Davis of any UK intention to negotiate bilaterally over Brexit. He added: “You cannot logically have a better deal [outside the EU] while not belonging to the single market or the customs union.” Asked what the chief obstacles Britain faced in the coming negotiations were, Maasikas said: “Mr Davis maintained the line of the prime minister that they think that due to their regulatory convergence that the trade agreement can be negotiated in the two-year period. Everyone else is saying: ‘Do you really think that an agreement is negotiable in this time period?’ And the answer [from Davis] is: ‘We think it is feasible because we have regulatory convergence.’ He said Britain faced a problem in how the process of negotiations will be arranged because of the European commission’s insistence that it will only negotiate on a future trade deal once the UK has agreed to pay all its liabilities, which could amount to a bill of €57bn (£48bn). Haggling over the sum is expected to continue deep into the talks, with ministers and MPs likely to balk at the size of the divorce bill. The Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, said of the EU member states: “We all 27 understand that we need to keep unity and solidarity in negotiations with the United Kingdom.” He said that Britain understood this but added that he believed the timescale allowed under article 50 would be “quite an issue” for the UK. “One of the major issues at the beginning will be how we organise the process,” he said after talks with Davis. “The EU want to see first the divorce and second the future relations. The UK wants comprehensive negotiations on the divorce and the future. That’s going to be quite an issue.” Rinkēvičs added: “The biggest trouble is we [in the EU] have quite a good experience of enlargement [but] we have no experience of members exiting and it is going to be quite a learning curve for everyone.” The former Lithuanian prime minister, Gediminas Kirkilas, now chair of the Lithuanian parliament’s EU affairs committee, said he had raised with Davis the importance of Britain paying its dues. Lithuania is depending on EU money for the decommissioning of a nuclear power station and for infrastructure works. At a press conference in Riga, Davis described recent media reports that money would be diverted from development projects in Africa and Asia to the Baltic states and other eastern EU countries as part of his charm offensive as “implausible”. “I didn’t recognise the story I saw in the papers the other day,” he said. “It seemed to me to be wholly implausible. We have not started the negotiation yet but that is not the way I think it’s going to go.” He added: “It’s not a divorce, it’s a new relationship ... it’s very modern in that respect.” Davis assured Latvians that Britain wanted to preserve equal rights for EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. “We want to see Latvian citizens in the UK have all the rights they have now continuing into the future. That’s not just resident rights, that’s public services, healthcare, all the normal rights we would give our own citizens,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/10/friends-of-the-earth-nuclear-power-bbc-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-10T12:59:52Z","webTitle":"Friends of the Earth denies dropping nuclear power opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/10/friends-of-the-earth-nuclear-power-bbc-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/10/friends-of-the-earth-nuclear-power-bbc-report","fields":{"headline":"Friends of the Earth denies dropping nuclear power opposition","bodyText":"Friends of the Earth has denied dropping its opposition to nuclear power after the BBC reported that the green group had made a “huge and controversial shift” in its stance. A news bulletin on Radio 4’s Today programme said that the group had revealed it was no longer opposed to nuclear power in principle, describing as a “significant shift” for the organisation, which has campaigned against nuclear power since it was founded in 1969. Roger Harrabin, the BBC’s environment analyst, reported: “Recently splits have appeared [in the environmental movement’s opposition to nuclear] as some leading independent greens have suggested the world cannot tackle climate change without nuclear power ... “Today a spokesman [for Friends of the Earth] revealed the group’s new stance – it’s no longer against nuclear power in principle although it still opposes new nuclear power stations because they’re too expensive and, intriguingly, take too long to build.” He called it “a huge and controversial shift.” But the green group’s executive director, Andy Atkins, released a statement saying the group had made no changes to its stance on nuclear Atkins said: “Friends of the Earth has not changed its position on nuclear power. We remain firmly opposed to it and continue to strongly promote a transition to an energy system based on energy efficiency and our abundant resource of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper to exploit by the day. “We have always been an evidence-based organisation and we commission independent reports to ensure our policy positions are robust, and we will continue to do so in the future. Craig Bennett, the group’s director of policy and campaigns, and the spokesman whose comments the BBC had based its report on, said the BBC’s news reporting had been “misleading” and asked the broadcaster to make a correction. Bennett had appeared on a package on energy security earlier in the Today programme, and was asked by journalist Justin Rowlatt whether Friends of the Earth was no longer worried about the risk from radiation. Bennett said: “Of course there are real concerns about radiation particularly around nuclear waste and it’s right we are concerned about that. But it’s important the debate has shifted down the years – the real concern now is how we get on fast with decarbonising our electricity supply, if you look at the models, it shows nuclear cannot be delivered fast.” Harrabin defended the BBC’s reporting, writing on Twitter: “Does FoE want existing nukes closed? No. Is its main objection now cost not safety? Yes. You’re not pro-nuke but this is shift.” Tweets from the official Friends of the Earth account responded that there was no shift in position: “Safety including waste still big intractable issue, new evidence on cost makes arguments against even stronger.” Several high profile environmental commentators who were previously opposed to nuclear power, including Guardian columnist George Monbiot and author Mark Lynas, have changed their position in recent years and given their backing to nuclear power as a low carbon source of energy because of the urgency of tackling climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/12/safe-at-last-view-from-naraha-the-first-fukushima-community-declared-fit-for-humans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-12T01:00:03Z","webTitle":"Safe at last?

View from Naraha – the first Fukushima community declared fit for humans","bodyText":"Entering the living room of Kohei and Tomoko Yamauchi’s house in Naraha is a disconcerting experience. Above the tatami-mat floor, the shelves are lined with rows of kokeshi dolls; to one side is a large display of daruma figures, a traditional harbinger of good fortune. Kohei’s ancestors look down from framed black-and-white photographs mounted on the wall. It is hard to imagine a more immaculate home. Yet for four and a half years, the Yamauchis’ house, along with every other home in the picturesque town in Fukushima prefecture, was deserted. On 12 March 2011, Naraha’s residents were told to evacuate immediately. A day earlier, the north-east coast of Japan had been shaken by one of the most powerful earthquakes in history. The quake set off a 46ft (14m) tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people and triggered a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Just as the Yamauchis contemplated the huge loss of life from the tsunami they were confronted with a second, unseen menace – large radiation leaks from Fukushima Daiichi, just 12 miles (19km) to the north. “Our children told us never to come back to this place,” says Kohei, one of a small number of residents who returned to Naraha last month after it became the first contaminated community in Fukushima prefecture to be declared fit for human habitation. The stress of moving from one temporary home to another – the Yamauchis have moved six times since the disaster – outweighs any concerns they have about radiation, the 79-year-old adds. “We’re too old to be worried about getting cancer from radiation exposure. I expect a lot of older people will return, but not their children or grandchildren. It’s going to be difficult to raise children here.” Officials in Naraha are confronting the reality that almost five years on from the nuclear meltdown, many of the town’s residents have simply started again elsewhere, including the thousands who now live in temporary housing or private accommodation in the nearby city of Iwaki. When he lifted the evacuation order in early September, Naraha’s mayor, Yukiei Matsumoto, said: “The clock has just started ticking again for our town. We will accelerate efforts to achieve full recovery.” Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has touted Naraha as a beacon of hope for about 70,000 other Fukushima residents who have yet to be given the all-clear to return to their homes. Yet Naraha’s streets, mostly deserted even on a sunny Friday afternoon, suggests the town serves as more of a cautionary tale about misplaced optimism. Only 200-300 people have returned since last month – including just two children – out of a pre-disaster population of 7,400 – according to local officials. Most of those who have decided to come home are retirees, and they are nowhere to be seen. Most of the shoppers and diners at a prefabricated arcade near the town hall are among the 1,000 construction workers brought in to repair the tattered local infrastructure. At the top of a quake-damaged road still closed to traffic, builders are putting the finishing touches to a new junior high school, even though it is not scheduled to open until spring 2017. Even then, there is no guarantee there will be any children to teach. Grand wooden homes stand empty, their windows framed by thick tape to deter burglars. Weeds poke through the tarmac forecourt of a dilapidated petrol station, and outside the local railway station, where trains began running in June last year, dozens of abandoned bicycles gather rust. “It’s effectively a ghost town” said Seijun Watanabe, who commutes from Iwaki to Naraha to work at a restaurant. “You see lots of people milling around, but they’re all construction workers, not the people I used to live alongside before the disaster.” Watanabe’s home was damaged in the earthquake, then overrun by animals during the four and a half years it has stood empty. “It’s full of animal faeces, no one can live there,” the 56-year-old said. “My wife and I plan to demolish it, rebuild on the same land and come back in five or 10 years.” “It’s impossible to know what the future holds, but I don’t think this place will ever be the same again. Lots of residents are in their 70s and 80s – no one in their 30s and 40s, especially parents of young children, is interested in coming back. It is beautiful around here, but life is really inconvenient.” Officials say the laborious task of removing contaminated soil from around residential areas, schools, shops and public buildings has been completed, although about 100 households have reported radiation spikes and asked for the work to be redone. The average atmospheric radiation level in the town is 0.3 microsieverts an hour, or just less than three millisieverts (mSv) a year, according to official readings. That is slightly higher than the government-set “ambition” of one mSv a year – a target that experts have criticised as unrealistically low. Most agree that the risk of developing cancer rises by a very small amount at doses above 100 millisieverts a year. “Our aim is for everyone to come back, but there is no strict timeline,” said Yusuke Igari, one of 80 local officials who have been preparing Naraha for the residents’ return. “Some people might wait another five or 10 years, or even longer. “We want to be a model of recovery for other towns and villages. If we can’t get people to resume their lives here, then other communities won’t stand a chance. We feel a deep sense of responsibility about that.” Shimpei Koizumi is one of the few people who can imagine a life for his family in Naraha. “My mother and daughter pleaded with me to fix the house because they desperately wanted to move back, but couldn’t afford to pay someone else to do it,” says the 65-year-old carpenter, who has just finished replacing roof tiles shaken to the ground by the earthquake. But Koizumi, who is living in temporary housing in Iwaki, won’t be joining his family. “I don’t trust the authorities when they say the water is safe to drink, and there are no proper shops, just a couple of convenience stores and vending machines. And there’s no one around. I’d rather stay where I am.” Striking evidence of Naraha’s place in Japan’s worst nuclear accident covers large swaths of the town’s outskirts. About 580,000 black bags filled with low-level nuclear waste blanket fields where farmers once grew the region’s famed rice and vegetables – produce that, even if declared safe, has become tainted by the damage radiation has inflicted on Brand Fukushima. In places, though, there are gentle stirrings of a post-Fukushima version of civic life. Two convenience stores have reopened, along with a supermarket and a mobile bank, and the local post office will reopen soon. From next month residents will be able to discuss their health and finances at a new heath centre and credit union. The government hopes to lift all evacuation orders except for the most contaminated areas nearest to the stricken plant by March 2017, and is offering up to 100,000 yen per household to move back. In Naraha, as in the rest of Fukushima, opinion is divided on whom to blame for the disaster. It isn’t hard to find Tepco critics, yet others remember the huge subsidies and employment their hometown derived from its nuclear-host status. “I don’t think this is anyone’s fault,” says Watanabe. “This place received lots of money from Tepco, and that enabled us to enjoy a certain standard of living. It meant we had more money and resources than other places that didn’t have nuclear plants nearby.” Yamauchi, a retired farmer whose family has lived in the same house for seven generations, is reluctant to apportion blame. He is, he says, just relieved to be back among his collection of kokeshi and daruma, watched over by his ancestors. “There’s no point getting angry or bitter about what happened,” he says. “That won’t change anything. All we want to do is look forward and get on with our lives again. We were always going to come back … this is our home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/feb/19/coalition-says-it-may-change-clean-energy-finance-corporation-rules-to-fund-coal-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T01:48:35Z","webTitle":"Coalition says it may change Clean Energy Finance Corporation rules to fund coal plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/19/coalition-says-it-may-change-clean-energy-finance-corporation-rules-to-fund-coal-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/feb/19/coalition-says-it-may-change-clean-energy-finance-corporation-rules-to-fund-coal-plants","fields":{"headline":"Coalition says it may change Clean Energy Finance Corporation rules to fund coal plants","bodyText":"The Coalition is considering changing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation rules to fund new coal-powered plants. One week after the CEFC chief executive, Oliver Yates, told a Senate committee that investment in new coal plants were a very risky proposition for taxpayers, the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the change was an option because “it’s called the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, not the renewable energy corporation”. Currently, the CEFC cannot invest in any project that does not reduce emissions by 50% or more on the average across the national electricity market. The CEFC rules, set by the previous Labor government, also rule out funding nuclear power and carbon capture and storage. Frydenberg said the newer high efficiency lower emissions (Hele) coal-fired plants – also known as ultra-super critical plants – could not be funded under the CEFC. Asked whether he thought the standard of a 50% missions reduction was unreasonable, Frydenberg said on the ABC’s Insiders program: “The issue is if you can lower emissions and stabilise the system with baseload power, that’s a pretty good outcome for Australian households. “That is certainly one of the options that we are looking at because we have recognised that we have an obligation after what we have seen in South Australia to ensure that this does not happen across the country.” Labor immediately ruled out supporting any legislative change to the rules, with the shadow environment minister, Mark Butler, saying it would not be party to changing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation into the coal finance corporation. “The government’s so-called clean coal is twice as polluting as gas-fired power, as well as being more expensive than renewables and gas,” Butler said. “New coal plants are inconsistent with Australia’s obligations under the Paris agreement, to have a net zero emission energy system by mid-century. “The CEFC has itself said coal would be ‘very risky for taxpayers’ and has said it would not support new coal investments.” Butler said the government had no real energy policy and was using coal as a distraction rather than doing the serious work to remove policy uncertainty. Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, is currently conducting a review of the electricity market after South Australia suffered statewide blackouts. His interim report found investment in the energy sector had stalled due to policy uncertainty. Finkel also warned that Australia’s current climate policy would not allow the country to meet its emission reduction targets signed on to in Paris. Frydenberg invoked Finkel – who will present a final report in June – to support the government’s push for new coal plants. Asked if Finkel would recommend new coal-fired power stations, Frydenberg said the chief scientist “says that low emissions coal with CCS, carbon capture and storage, is a very effective and very legitimate technology – that’s Alan Finkel’s words”. But Finkel has been reluctant to state whether taxpayers should subsidise new coal plants. At the prime minister’s first key speech of 2017, Malcolm Turnbull flagged the government moving to a technology neutral approach to lower emissions, opening up the possibility of “clean coal” – a move strongly pushed by his resources minister, Matt Canavan. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, also suggested it would be “morally prudent” to support new coal-fired plants “so that poor people can turn the lights on like we do”. But key Senate crossbencher Nick Xenophon called on the Coalition to look at an emissions intensity scheme to stabilise the electricity system and make Australia’s electricity supply more stable. “More and more experts are saying that that is the best way to reduce power prices and ensure security of energy supply,” Xenophon told ABC. Frydenberg initially said an emissions intensity scheme, where big energy polluters have to pay more, would be considered as part of Australia’s climate policy. Within 24 hours, Frydenberg was forced to rule it out when several backbenchers and the senior frontbencher Christopher Pyne criticised the option. The former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi used it as an example of why he left the Liberal party to sit on the Senate crossbench. On Sunday, Xenophon said the toxic culture of federal politics had prevented political parties working out a policy solution at the same time as his state of South Australia was hit by rising power prices and blackouts. “The way to achieve our Paris agreement [emissions reduction] targets ... is to have more gas-fired generators in the short term to give you the baseload of supply and, of course, once we get battery storage perfected, then you can let it rip in terms of intermittent forms of energy supply,” he said. The Greens’ climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said coal was dirty and the only way new power stations would be built was if the government propped them up. “Subsidising coal because we need electricity is like subsidising asbestos because we need houses,” Bandt said. “The CSIRO has told us that the best way to cut pollution and make the electricity grid stable is through renewables and storage, not more coal. “Redirecting its renewables money towards coal and changing its rules to allow projects that don’t even cut pollution by half would kill off the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, just like Tony Abbott tried and failed to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2016/oct/05/margaret-mckenzie-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-05T14:09:09Z","webTitle":"Margaret Mckenzie obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/05/margaret-mckenzie-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2016/oct/05/margaret-mckenzie-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Margaret Mckenzie obituary","bodyText":"My mother, Margaret Mckenzie, who has died aged 83, led a varied life during which she worked on the development of Hinkley Point nuclear power station, taught in a one-room US schoolhouse and acted as a tour guide at Cardiff castle. Margaret Iveson (known to family and friends as “M”) was born in Whitworth, Lancashire, the youngest of four children of George, a police sergeant, and his wife, Elizabeth (nee Dinsdale). When her father was promoted to inspector in Urmston, she attended a grammar school in the town. Sheltering from wartime air-raids in the basement of the local power station stimulated an interest that led to her studying mathematics and physics at Manchester University. After completing her degree, she took a job with English Electric in Whetstone, Leicestershire, working on research and development for Hinkley Point. Here, where her Deuce computer filled a large room but had only a fraction of the processing power of a smartphone, she met a young engineer called William (known as “B”), whom she married in 1960. In 1964, B became a lecturer at the School of Mines in Pontypridd (now part of the University of South Wales). They moved to the hilltop village of Llantrisant, to their first and only house; it is now filled with her artwork, his wood-turning and their vast library of books. My brother, Colin, and I arrived in the late 1960s. In 1976 the family exchanged lives with a lecturer from Vermont for a year. During this time, M managed six months of snowy winter in a 100-year-old wooden house heated by wood-burning stoves, while working as a teaching assistant in an experimental multi-age, one-room schoolhouse where we children could choose our own subjects to study. The year was capped with a six-week trip around the US in an old Toyota Corolla with no air-conditioning and two bickering children in the back seat. Back in Britain M worked as a guide at Cardiff castle and in the gallery at the Model House art centre in Llantrisant, where she discovered a passion for art. An honours degree with the Open University followed and she took great joy in painting and drawing. In the 90s M went off to a local aikido group, thinking it was a form of yoga, but discovered it was actually a Japanese martial art. She loved the philosophy and mental discipline involved and persevered, eventually achieving her black belt. M loved poetry and nature, using her stare to discourage local cats from harming the thriving bird population fed in the back garden. She is survived by B, Colin and me, and her grandchildren, James, Emily and Finlay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2016/jul/29/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T20:00:14Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/jul/29/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2016/jul/29/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• In an editorial about the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, we referred to “Its two sister stations, currently under construction in Iceland and France”.

I’m sure Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won’t be deterred by the likes of Dell, though. The Davos mental health panel is getting a good reception. Here’s some early reaction: Elsewhere in Davos, international trade secretary Liam Fox has held constructive talks with his Israeli counterpart - and not a champagne glass in sight. Fascinatingly, Prince William now suggests that Britain’s wartime generation have been hurting themselves bottling up their feelings - rather than breaking down the stigma of mental health. British people are particularly bad at expressing emotions, the Duke jokes. He suggests it goes back to the war (he doesn’t specify if he means world war 1 or 2). When people lost so many loved ones, and dealt with such devastation, they concluded that talking wouldn’t fix the issue, William says. A whole generation decided this was the best way to deal with it, and then by accident they passed it onto their children, he explains. They learned the lesson that: This is how you deal with problems - you don’t talk about them. Now, though, William believes a new generation has realised that this is not how to deal with the situation. Then, with his voice cracking briefly, he explains that there was ‘one particular job’ that really challenged his mental health. The packed hall at Davos sits, engrossed, in silence as Prince William explains his own mental health issues. He says he began feeling issues when he worked as an air ambulance, dealing with a lot of trauma every day. This has given him empathy and solidarity with the medical profession. They say it’s a job, but my goodness they do a very hard job every day. It’s normal to feel these emotions, William continues, adding: If you don’t feel anything, you should get checked out for that. Prince William is now talking about the importance of removing the stigma around mental health. Since launching the Heads Together campaign, the Duke says, he regularly has people around the world thanking him -- because either they’ve been affected, or they know someone who has. They’re just grateful that someone has made it easier to discuss these issues, he says, adding: Ten years ago I knew nothing about mental health. I read about it, and became immersed in it, because it was a key social problem, globally, and someone had to burst the bubble. The Prince now warns that the scale of the mental health problem is enormous. We’ve got to start tackling it now, because there are still so many people who are suffering in silence. There is still this stigma attached to mental health that we’ve got to completely obliterate before we can move to the next stage. On the corporate side, HSBC CEO John Flint is discussing his efforts to make staff feel safe and secure in the workforce. There’s a spectrum on mental health, and everyone is on it, he says. Flint then pays tribute to those within HSBC’s workforce of 238,000 people who have been through mental illness, and come out the other side.. Those who have recovered often possess a resilience and a resourcefulness and an interest in human nature and an empathy and an EQ that the rest of us often don’t possess. They are an absolute asset, and a community we should celebrate, he adds. Dr Dixon Chibanda, Director of the African Mental Health Research Initiative, is describing an important project called the ‘Friendship Bench’ , that aims to improve mental health. It’s based on the idea of a physical bench where people in need can sit down and talk to someone. More details here. There’s a friendship bench here at Davos: Now Jacinda Ardern explains that her government is prioritising mental health, because it affects everyone. One of the sad facts for New Zealand is that everyone knows someone who has taken their own life. We’re a small country, of less than 5 million people, but last year more than 600 people committed suicide, she adds. Arden explains how she has been affected personally: I have lost friends, and I wouldn’t have to look far in my cabinet to find other people who have too. The Duke of Cambridge is talking about how his charity work turned him into a committed, and pioneering, campaigner on mental health issues. Prince William says he has realised there is an “elephant in the room” in all the charities he worked with - from addiction and homelessness to veterans’ welfare and young disadvanted people. That was mental health. No-one was talking about it. No-one wanted to talk about it. So he, and the Duchess of Cambridge, created their Heads Together campaign to ‘lance the boil’ and let people speak and express themselves. But it wasn’t easy. William reveals that not a single celebrity wanted to help his campaign, when he did a big ring round to drum up support. He says: No-one was interested in being part of Heads Together, because it was about mental health. But once the ball was rolling, and people saw how committed he and Catherine were, some “very brave” people and celebrities came forward to speak out. Q: So have people who turned you down before now asked to be involved? It’s much easier to get people involved now, he replies diplomatically. Becky Quick of CNBC is moderating the panel, and starts by warning that mental health isn’t getting the attention it deserves. Poor mental health costs 2.5 trillion dollars in lost productivity and is a “leading cause of disability worldwide.” 90% of people with depression in low and middle-income get no help to all, Quick adds. The session begins with a video showing the scale of the mental health crisis, and some of the details are extremely serious. Suicide rates have spiked, it warns, with one person taking their own life every 40 seconds. Everyone, everywhere, must have someone to turn to in time of need. The world of business, government and education must come together to address this problem, with the time and money needed to make a difference. Now it’s time for the WEF session on mental health. Prince William and Jacinda Ardern, PM of New Zealand, are appearing on a panel, alongside HSBC chief executive John Flint, and Bernard J. Tyson of Kaiser Permanente. The panel will discuss how the global community can promote mental health - a vital issue, given that one in four of us will experience mental illness in our lifetime. As well as the human cost, there’s an economic cost too (hey, this is the World Economic Forum). Mental illness is expected to cost the global economy an estimated $6 trillion by 2030. The session is packed, as Davos delegates squeeze in to hear what the panel have to say. Boom! Chinese vice-president Wang Qishan has offered a hand of friendship to America. He says neither side wins from confrontation, and they should focus on creating a win-win situation instead. Unfortunately, with the US delegation back home, there’s no-one to grasp it, as the clock ticks towards the end-of-February deadline for a trade war deal. Three protesters were arrested on the sidelines of the WEF this afternoon. Leo Hyde from the Public Services International Trade Union, who was among those arrested, said they were dressed as “corporate wolves” to protest against investor state dispute settlement, which allows multinationals to sue governments in secretive international courts. They set up just outside of the main security barriers leading to the congress centre and released around an hour ago. He said they were arrested after just 30 seconds. “Davos isn’t a friendly place for protests,” Hyde, who hails from France, said. “We were arrested and brought to an underground garage where the police took all our belongings, searched through our bags etc. “We were held there for around an hour and not allowed to speak to each other. They then made me delete some of the footage/photos off my SD card. We are not sure if we will be charged with anything or not.” Back in London, Jeremy Corbyn challenged Theresa May at their weekly prime minister’s questions session about why six cabinet ministers were going to Davos. Speaking afterwards, her official spokesman told journalists that ministers were there on business: “I think you can see from the issues which they’re due to be discussing, it’s an important event, it’s an opportunity to discuss investment opportunities in the UK, and it’s an opportunity to discuss some really important technological issues which will help people’s lives, such as AI” Confirming that Philip Hammond (chancellor), Liam Fox (international trade secretary), Greg Clark (business secretary), Penny Mordaunt (international development) Jeremy Wright (culture, media and sport) and Matt Hancock (health), will all be there, he insisted, “If you look across the policy briefs of those ministers - the fact that Matt Hancock’s there and Jeremy Wright’s there - that does reflect the role technology’s going to play going forward, the importance of government’s industrial strategy. They will be focused on developing technologies in a way that can make a difference to people back home.” Wang concludes with an absolutely classic piece of Davos-speak: In this changing world, making advance is like climbing a mountain. It is commitment, conviction and confidence that drive us forward. In this era of unfolding economic globalization, all of us mankind share a common stake. As a Swiss proverb goes, “Torches light up each other.” Let us illuminate the path ahead, progress together, ascend to the summit and jointly create a great future for all mankind. China’s vice-president Wang Qishan has fired a couple of barbs at the west. On technology (a hot topic given the concerns over China’s Huawei), Wang says: It is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony, interfering in other countries’ domestic affairs, and conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries’ national security. We need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equals. And on globalisation, Wang says inequality should be addressed - without stopping the global ‘economic pie’ growing. He calls for a targeted approach to address the problems created by globalization”. What we need to do is make the pie bigger while looking for ways to share it in a more equitable way. The last thing we should do is to stop making the pie and just engage in a futile debate on how to divide it. Shifting blame for one’s own problems onto others will not resolve the problems. Now Wang Qishan, Vice President of China, is addressing Davos. He starts by saying 2019 is the 40th anniversary of China’s involvement in WEF (which is 49 this year), and the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People’s Republic of China. Those seven decades have seen “remarkable achievements”, talking of a historical transformation in social productivity and national strength. This has deliver prosperity to its people who were once struggling to meet their basic living needs, Wang continues (breezily ignoring the tens of millions who died in the Great Leap Forwards). Wang claims China is becoming “an important force for upholding world peace and promoting common development”. He gives Davos a history lesson, taking about how China fell behind because its emperors closed their doors to the world, when the west was industrialising and exploring the oceans. That was reversed by the Communist Party of China, as it began to create a New China 70 years ago. Taking questions, Angela Merkel speaks of how emotional it felt to sign the Aachen treaty with France’s Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday [it will deepen ties between the two countries, but doesn’t go as far as some had hoped]. She touches on the role of inequality in populism; if a businessman can make more money from selling a business than a craftsman can earn in a lifetime, people will wonder what is their work worth today? We cannot afford a split in society between those who want progress [and benefit from it], and those who carry the burden, she adds. Merkel also declines to say whether she’d come back to Davos once she’s stepped down as chancellor. You have me today, so you should be grateful for what you have, she jokes before leaving the stage. Angela Merkel summed up her defence of the current world order: “We have populist challenges, we have to stand up against them. I will come out strongly in favour of a multilateral order, not ending with the EU, but one that gives good answers to challenges of tomorrow Having rattled through her speech at her usual rapid pace, Merkel ends by telling the (now-packed) Davos congress hall that she will continue to defend the world order from attack. The existing world order must not be ruined, she concludes, returning to her earlier defence of globalisation and the institutions that underpin it. Onto Brexit! Where Merkel says “we must deal with the shock” that Britain wants to leave the EU. All my efforts are devoted to making Brexit happen in as “well-ordered” a manner as possible, she adds. We want to have a good future partnership with the UK she continues, saying that in key areas such as defence Germany is “absolutely dependent” on its partnership with Britain. And on the issue of HOW Britain leaves, Merkel says that the less complicated relations with Britain are, the better. [But she doesn’t offer any suggestion of new flexibility over the withdrawal deal or future relationship] Merkel shifts to the migration crisis that gripped Europe a couple of years ago. Germany’s demographic changes mean we now have a policy of immigration for skilled labour, says Merkel (one of the big decisions by her new coalition government - and a change from the earlier open door approach Merkel pioneered). We need to manage migration better, but over recent years we have made great strides. She also urges Davos delegates to see Africa as a continent of hope, and of opportunity On climate change, Angela Merkel says it’s a crucial problem, world leaders have a responsibility to solve it. BUT in almost the next breath, she hits out at calls for Germany to end its use of coal. Merkel points out that Berlin is also planning to end its nuclear power industry by 2020. The only energy source that can generate energy all the time is brown coal (cheaper and polluting) and hard coal, Merkel says. A commission is working its final conclusions, but Merkel seems to have pre-empted it, saying that Germany needs coal. We will continue to receive Russian natural gas, and other sources. If we leave coal, if we leave nuclear, we will need more natural gas - and energy needs to be affordable, she says. This will disappoint environmental groups, who have hoped that Merkel could play a decisive role in ending the era of coal. This is the key message from Angela Merkel’s speech: Merkel now turns to artificial intelligence, saying we need agreements for ‘ethical guidelines’, both for AI and bioethics. Merkel says leaders should remember their national interest - but also remember that other people have national interest. Factor them in, and you can have a “win-win situation.” [a more globalist approach than Donald Trump’s MAGA strategy] The German chancellor then launches a defence of the global world order - as it comes under attack from populists and nationalists. Merkel says the world order is under pressure, but it’s important to remember that key decisions underpinning its institutions were made 74 years go, after the second world war. After the horrors of the second world war, the people in charge had certain instincts, Merkel says firmly. We shouldn’t cast their decisions aside, and treat it lightly, as they took them against a wealth of experience, she insists. But.. Merkel also chides international organisations are slow at reforming. If a system doesn’t react quickly enough, some will create new institutions who will throw their weight around. And in a nod to emerging economies, Merkel says such institutions should be reformed so that “that the balance of power is realistically represented” A decade after the financial crisis, you can still see the impact of the crash on the banks, Merkel. But she also sees reasons for optimism. One is the fall in extreme poverty. She’s pleased that the sustainable development goals have been adopted, and confident that we will be able to eliminate extreme policy. She also cites agreements on migration. There’s a buzz in the congress hall again, as German chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to give her special address. She starts by talking about the stable coalition government in Germany - after a rather rocky start, we’re all working together well, she smiles. Merkel cites two concerns - the threat of cyber-espionage, and disquiet in the international system as a whole, which leads to the IMF lowering its growth projections. On the whole, the picture is rather gloomy. But many people are prepared to strengthen the global order, she insists. Business leaders don’t seem to be holding out any hope they’ll get clarification around Brexit from UK ministers who on the ground in Davos, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox (writes Kalyeena Makortoff). There are also very low expectations that the UK team will come back with any trade pacts. One British industry chairman, who spoke to me on condition of anonymity, said: “We’re not expecting the UK to come back with any deals (from Davos)” but “Fox will pretend” he was successful. The chancellor is set to give a speech at the annual British business lunch on Thursday afternoon, but the chairman said he’s “not expecting any more clarity from Hammond, though he may repeat what he said on the call”, referring to a conference call with business leaders following the parliamentary vote on May’s exit deal earlier this month. But few guests will be keen to air their views or push back hard on the Chancellor. “The politics of Brexit is so toxic, no business leader will be expressing a big view,” he said, explaining that with the risk is too high. “With 140 people attending, nothing will stay private.” European markets have erased earlier losses, boosted by a rise in Wall Street futures. The FTSE 100 is the exception, still in the red, as the rise in the pound bites. Here are the latest scores: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,889 Germany’s DAX: +0.3% at 11,121 France’s CAC: +0.4% at 4,867 Italy’s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 19,538 Spain’s IBEX: +1.2% at 9,144 Europe’s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 356 AM Bono has changed his tune on the IMF. He once saw it as a ‘great Satan’, due to its emphasis on structural reforms and “bullying of junior economies. Now, though, Bono says the development community “really values” the tough-mindedness shown by Christine Lagarde. During her time at Davos, Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s director general, has detected worries that Brexit is weighing on the world economy. She tells us: At my meetings at Davos, there is a recognition that the causes of the vulnerability of the global economy now include Brexit. It is everyone’s interest that Britain leaves the EU in a way that works for the British economy, the European economy and indeed the global economy.” Fairbairn added: “The most critical thing is to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Business wants no deal ruled out for March 29 as soon as possible. The boost to confidence and investment would be immediate. Without that happening, there will be a continuing drain on jobs and investment across the country.” [Apologies, our earlier entry contained errors so has been deleted. My mistake. GW] Brexit has been one of the key topics on the sidelines of Davos so far and rising expectations that the EU divorce date will be delayed are pushing up the pound. Sterling is above the $1.30 mark for the first time in 10 weeks, and is currently up 0.5% at $1.3026. The pound is also at a 10-week high against the euro, up 0.5% at €1.1462. Lukman Otunuga, analyst at currency firm FXTM, says that the boost to the pound could be short-lived: Sterling bulls were instilled with a renewed sense of confidence today with the GBPUSD breaking above 1.30 as fears over a ‘no deal’ Brexit continued to ease. Growing speculation over the government extending article 50 to avoid a nightmare no-deal outcome is likely to continue supporting sterling in the near term. However, the pound’s medium- to longer-term outlook remains shrouded by Brexit’s endless uncertainty. Sterling volatility and sensitivity to Brexit headlines are likely to increase ahead of the parliamentary debate on January 29th. One must always expect the unexpected when dealing with Brexit. Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, says he’s attending the World Economic Forum to discuss artificial intelligence, arguing the UK can be a world leader regardless of Brexit. Speaking as he arrived at WEF, Wright explained that he’s holding “a number of meetings”, and will attend the Global Council on AI on Thursday morning. Wright said he expects Brexit will come up during his meetings, but insists that’s not why he’s at Davos. He says: “Actually, what we’re trying to get across is there’s more to the UK than Brexit. “When you talk about artificial intelligence, the fundamentals of why we can do well in artificial intelligence are going to remain strong regardless of the Brexit outcome.” Those fundamentals include the UK’s world class universities, and “very highly-skilled technical companies” who choose to locate in the UK because of the regulatory and tax background. But what about concerns that you’re in Davos drinking champagne with the elite? Wright denied that he was in Davos to drink champagne, insisting he certainly hadn’t had any yet - Q: Will you be having any champagne? “I very much doubt it”, Wright insisted. “I very much doubt it.” Shinzo Abe struck a note of defiance and optimism in his speech. Here is quick summary. He started by outlining Japan’s progress since he became prime minister for a second time in 2012 - in getting more women into work, increasing the numbers of over 65s in work, and with a record number (98%) of college graduates finding work. Abe said child poverty has fallen during his administration, and that Japanese GDP has grown by 10.9%, or $490bn. Hope is the most important factor for growth. He then looked forward to the G20 summit which will be held in Osaka, Japan, in June, and focused on a couple of key areas that he hopes to discuss: The free flow of data. Abe said that while personal data, intellectual property and national security intelligence should be protected, medical, industrial, traffic and other non-personal data should flow freely, without borders. The need for new innovations to tackle climate change. He said Japan is already doing its bit to meet the aims for 2050 set out by the IPCC. AM Shinzo Abe finishes with his hopes for Japan as one of the most open countries in the world, drivers of peace and growth: Hope, is about looking forward to tomorrow, next year, the year after next, and 10 or 20 years down the road. Fortune has embraced my country. Events we are hosting over the next decade begin with this year’s G20 and rugby world cup and extend to Tokyo 2020 for the Olympics and Paralympics and to World Expo 2025, OsakaKansai. Most importantly, this year, for the first time in as long as 200 years, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan will abdicate and a new Emperor will take the throne. It is the dawn of a new era. Japan, now reinvigorated and revitalized, with your embrace, will continue to be one of the foremost open, democratic, and law-abiding contributors to peace and growth in the world. That’s the end of the speech. Abe says he will make a third and final point: My third and last point is about Japan’s commitment. Japan is determined to preserve and committed to enhancing the free, open, and rules-based international order. I am so very much pleased and proud to tell you that on December 30, 2018, we finally brought TPP11 [the trans-pacific trade agreement] into effect. Now, I must say, I am just as pleased and just as proud to make another announcement. Effective the first of February, which is just around the corner, the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement will enter into force. I call on all of us to rebuild trust toward the system for international trade. That should be a system that is fair, transparent, and effective in protecting IP and also in such areas as e-commerce and government procurement. Japan’s Prime Minister moves to his second point: the importance of innovation in tackling climate change. We need disruptions to remind us that the IPCC’s recent 1.5 degrees report tells us that [net carbon pollution] will have to come down to zero by 2050. We must have more disruptive innovations before it’s too late. It’s time now to think about CCU - carbon capture and utilisation. My government is aiming to reduce the cost of hydrogen by at least 90% by the year 2050 to make it cheaper than natural gas. We will be inviting to Japan top experts in science and technology from G20 member countries to combine forces in accelerating innovations. Spending money for a green earth and a blue ocean, once deemed costly, is now a growth generator. Decarbonisation and profit making can happen in tandem. We policymakers must be held responsible to make it happen, as I will be stressing [at the G20] in Osaka this year. He says to applause: May I now solemnly declare that defeatism about Japan is now defeated. He moves on to the G20 summit to be hosted in Japan later this year: Let there be hope and optimism for the future, providing reassurance that it is possible to achieve a hope-driven economy. As always, at that summit we’re going to discuss a range of issues. But today I’ll focus on two big issues - only two. First off: data governance. It will be data driving our economy forward. We had better act now. A delay of one year will be light years behind. We must on the one hand be able to out our personal data and intellectual property, national security and so on under careful protection. On the other hand we must enable the free flow of medical, industrial traffic and other useful non-personal data to see no borders. Repeat: no borders. The regime we need is data free flow with trust. Abe says industry 4.0 (the next industrial revolution) will being about society 5.0 in Japan. Data must be the great gap buster. It will bring about a new reality for humanity. Our cities will be made much more liveable for all sorts of people, from all walks of life. The engine for growth will be fuelled more and more by digital data, not gasoline. AM Out of every 100 college graduates looking to work, 98 find employment - a record number, Abe says. Wages have risen 2% year on year. As a result, during my six years in office, GDP has grown by 10.9%, adding $490bn. In order to make growth long lasting, we are encouraging investment which will enhance productivity. We are inviting skilled workers to Japan from abroad. How about the gap between the rich and the less affluent? During my administration, the child relative poverty rate, which had never before gone down, did go down for the first time, and did so significantly. He says the number of children from single parent homes attending college has risen from 24% to 42% during his time as PM. It will go up further as we are going to expand our free education from October this year. We are not widening the gap, we are narrowing it. Despair was wiped out by hope. Hope, ladies and gentlemen is the most important thing for growth. Breaking away from Shinzo Abe briefly, Liam Fox has also warned UK businesses that MPs won’t be able to block a no-deal Brexit. He’s be arguing at Davos that delaying Britain’s departure would be even worse than crashing out without a deal (something many business groups would dispute) Shinzo Abe takes to the stage to address delegates. He says it was five years since he was last at Davos. I’m very glad to be back. Abe says that back in 2012 (when he became PM for a second time), a lot of people thought “Japan is doomed”, with an ageing population. Japan could not grow, or so the argument went. It was a wall of despair and pessimism. Since that time our working population has dropped by about 4.5m people. We have responded by encouraging more women to work. As a result we now have 2 million more - I repeat - 2 million more women working. WEF’s founder Klaus Schwab is introducing Shinzo Abe, Japan’s Prime Minister. Dr Liam Fox has rejected claims that UK government ministers are in Davos for a jolly, as he races through the congress centre. Asked whether he was simply at the World Economic Forum to quaff champagne with the global elite, the secretary of state for international trade snaps back: “Does it look like it.” ...before vanishing into a secure area at WEF for a meeting. Yesterday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn declared: “Having botched Brexit and created a deadlock in Parliament, it’s shocking that a third of the Cabinet have the audacity to run off to sip champagne with the world’s elite.” Fox’s department says he is holding 18 bilateral meetings while at Davos, including trade ministers from South Korea, Hong Kong, Canada, Colombia and Israel. He’ll be working to ensure “continuity of trade for UK businesses trading with nations covered by existing EU trade agreements” after Brexit. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, will be giving a special address in Davos at 10.15am UK time. We’ll be blogging the speech here. IKEA boss Jesper Brodin has joined wildlife and environmental campaigners in using Davos as a platform to talk about climate. He tells CNBC: The biggest concern we have is that the clock is ticking when it comes to climate and resource scarcity. We need to find new business models, we need to find new equations for material in order to be able to serve the many people. That’s why we’re in a hurry. Big corporates need to take the role of responsibility. Being a big corporate we assume the responsibility. AM Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economics affairs has been speaking in Davos about Brexit. He says it’s now up to the UK to tell the EU where they want to go, adding that a delay to Brexit is possible: Of course, we are ready to discuss. You ask me about a delay ... this is a possible scenario, but for that there are two things that are required. First, we need to have unanimity on that - I’m not so worried about that because until now the 27 EU states are really united and I don’t see why this would change. Second we need a reason to extend. We need to know why to extend, what for, what’s the plan. The ball is clearly in the British side. AM Back in the sustainable development session, Lagarde also warns that it’s simply impossible poor countries to mobilise enough resources domestically to meet basic development goals for sectors such as health education roads and water. To meet UN sustainable development goals by 2030 will mean investment worth 15% of GDP for low income countries. Lagarde says: “That’s monumental. No way can that be done by domestic resource mobilisation. Business has to be part of it.” Marco Lambertino, director general of WWF International says humans are becoming detached from nature and have a moral responsibility to reverse this trend. Speaking on a Davos panel about the decline in wildlife populations, he also spoke of his own, lifelong passion for nature. I was born crazy about nature and wildlife. When I was 12 I joined WWF and I started raising funds to save the last 20 wolves in my country. Now in Italy there are 3,000 wolves, in my country. There are a lot of success stories and it’s all about co-existence and understanding that the web of life that is made of wolves and bees and so many other things, are the foundation of the functioning of the planet. Only recently we became detached from nature, we are in cities and the majority of the population is beginning to create a barrier between us and nature. We should be sad about the loss of nature and we should be very worried. Nature is providing to us every day for free fundamental services. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the water we use for agriculture and industries.. all this stuff we take for granted and we shouldn’t. The loss of nature is something we should fight against for the moral responsibility of species and our own self interest. AM At the Sustainable Development panel, Bono says capitalism has lifted people more out of poverty than “any other ism”, but warns: “It is a wild beast. If it is not tamed it can chew up a lot of people along the way.” Populism is the result of people being chewed up, he adds. IMF chief Christine Lagarde is also warning emerging market world leaders that corruption will put off investors from investing. Just in: UK chancellor Philip Hammond has dropped off a Davos panel scheduled for Friday morning, on the state of the global economy, we hear. He’s no longer listed as a speaker for the “Global Economy in Transition: Shaping a New Architecture” session, alongside the World Bank’s Kristalina Georgieva, South African central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago, economics professor Mariana Mazzucato, IMF chief Christine Lagarde and Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan. However, we think Hammond is still visiting Davos (he’s due to speak to business leaders on Thursday) That Economic outlook panel is traditionally the final set-piece event of Davos, with top politicians and central bankers giving their views. More as we get it.... Guardian commentator Aditya Chakrabortty sums up the problem with the ‘global elite’ at Davos this week: They care about other people’s problems – so long as they get to define them, and it’s never acknowledged that they are a large part of the problem. Which they are. If they want capitalism to carry on, the rich will need to give up their winnings and cede some ground. That point evades them. Welcoming Donald Trump last year, Klaus Schwab, Davos’s majordomo, praised the bigot-in-chief’s tax cuts for the rich and said, “I’m aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations.” The super-rich don’t hate all populists – just those who refuse to make them richer. World leaders, rightly, get heavily criticised for preaching sustainability and equality at Davos before nipping off to a exclusive dinner date. So after an underwhelming, pro-business speech yesterday, Brazil’s new president Jair Bolsonaro will have wanted to strike a different tone. Perhaps that’s why the Brazilian government has released a photo, showing Bolsonaro apparently serving himself a self-service supermarket restaurant. No frills here!.... Except, Bolsonaro has also been spotted at a very exclusive dinner last night, with some top-level tech CEOs at one of Davos’s luxury hotels. Not quite so man of the people.... As Davos day two gets underway, investors are finding little to cheer about in what has been a gloomy week so far for markets. Global growth fears, Brexit uncertainty and fading hopes of a speedy resolution to China’s trade spat with the US are all weighing on sentiment. Trading is underway in Europe, and markets have followed Wall Street and Asia lower: FTSE 100: -0.5% at 6,870 Germany’s DAX: -0.5% at 11,032 France’s CAC: -0.4% at 4,829 Italy’s FTSE MIB: -0.8% at 19,288 Spain’s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,011 STOXX 600: -0.5% at 353 AM Not everyone is Davos is keen on the World Economic Forum. Within view of the main security cordon, local residents have hung protest signs accusing WEF chief executive Klaus Schwab of ruining the Swiss mountain town of Davos and blaming his “friends” (assumedly, Davos attendees) of destroying the world. “Klaus Schwab fucked up our town,” one reads. “His friends fuck up the world,” another says, in big block letters. “Wipe out WEF” and “Climate change kills” signs are also hung across the homes. The Guardian’s Kalyeena Makortoff went to investigate.... I took a quick trek up the hill to see whether we could speak to the residents. One of the upstairs neighbours came in with his daughter, clad in ski gear. He directed me to the downstairs tenants. A middle aged woman opened the door but didn’t want to speak. I’m sure the WEF badge didn’t help.... Good morning from Davos. Heavy-hitting world leaders are in town today, as the second day of the World Economic Forum kicks off. Germany chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and China’s vice-president Wang Qishan will all address the global elite. Trade war concerns, and anxiety over the slowing global economy, should be on the agenda. Mental health is also getting some well-deserved attention. Prince William and New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern will examine an issue that will affect one in four people. Pop star activist Bono is in town too, pushing for more money for sustainable development. And Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the Web, is talking about how to create safe online environments - another key issue in the era of social media abuse and trolling (not what Sir Tim had in mind for his creation) UK government ministers are also in town and likely to be buttonholed by anxious business chiefs -- as several push the Brexit panic button. Here’s what’s on the agenda 8.15am GMT/9.15 Davos time: Bono and Christine Lagarde on sustainable development 9am GMT/10am Davos: Press conference on mental health, with Wellcome Trust’s Jeremy Farrer, Elisha London of United Global Mental Health, and Paul Stoffels of Johnson &amp; Johnson 10.15am GMT/11.15am Davos: Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s special address 1.15pm GMT/2.15pm Davos: German chancellor Angela Merkel’s special address 2pm GMT/3pm Davos: Chinese vice-president Wang Qishan’s special address 3pm GMT/4pm Davos: Panel on mental health matters including the Duke of Cambridge, Jacinda Ardern, and HSBC’s John Flint 4pm GMT/5pm Davos: Panel on ‘speaking out under stress’, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/may/21/magnox-nuclear-decommissioning-consortium-cut-1600-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-21T18:29:20Z","webTitle":"Magnox nuclear decommissioning consortium to cut up to 1,600 jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/21/magnox-nuclear-decommissioning-consortium-cut-1600-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/may/21/magnox-nuclear-decommissioning-consortium-cut-1600-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Magnox nuclear decommissioning consortium to cut up to 1,600 jobs","bodyText":"The new private consortium that recently won the £4.2bn management contract for the decommissioning of 12 Magnox nuclear power stations has revealed plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs. Cavendish Nuclear, a division of Babcock International, plus its US partner Fluor, said the cuts reflected “planned stepdowns in the work programme” at a number of atomic sites around the UK. The move comes amid speculation that Babcock is preparing to demand millions of pounds of extra subsidies from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) on the grounds that the workload was much heavier than anticipated. Unions expressed shock that staff, agency and contract workers would lose their jobs between now and September 2016, although the Cavendish Fluor Partnership said it would try to find some alternative posts. Eleven of the plants have already shut down and the remaining one in operation – Wylfa on Anglesey in North Wales – is due to stop generating power at the end of the year. Industry experts said other plants were getting to the end of defuelling and other activities that had required staffing to be increased. “These proposed reductions arise from planned stepdowns in the work programme at a number of sites and the implementation of a more streamlined operating model for delivering decommissioning,” said the consortium in a statement. “We will seek wherever possible for these reductions to be through voluntary means and we will endeavour to retrain staff in roles where we are currently reliant on agency resources.” Gary Smith, national secretary for energy at the GMB union, which has about 600 members at Magnox, told Sky News: “Some of these job losses have been planned for quite some time. Others will come as a shock, particularly for the workforce employed on temporary contracts. We’re pleased that the first tranche of job losses will be on voluntary basis. But this will be a tough time for a lot of Magnox workers.” The NDA said it was confident that the contract would deliver savings for the taxpayer of around £1bn compared with the previous plan over the full 14-year period and “well above the competition’s original target to secure 10% off the baseline costs”. The Cavendish Fluor Partnership won the contract to manage the 12 Magnox sites last September in a bitter battle against the incumbent, Energy Solutions. When it lost out, Energy Solutions launched a legal challenge. Problems with the decommissioning of the separate Sellafield site in Cumbria have recently led to the private consortium there which includes Amec and Areva of France – being thrown off the management contract.

A comprehensive agreement on the future of Iran’s nuclear programme is likely to be unveiled on Monday. Iran is expected to accept curbs on its nuclear plans in return for significant easing of sanctions that would allow it to increase oil exports. Brent crude fell almost 3%, or $1.70 to $57.06 a barrel. The oil price plunged from $116 a barrel in June 2014 to less than $50 in January as investors reacted to concerns over world economic growth and an abundance of oil as a result of increased US production. News that European leaders had reached an agreement on Greece pushed up the price off its lowest levels to about $57.30 a barrel. Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets said more drilling platforms in the US were also putting downward pressure on the oil price. “An increase of 17 [rigs] in the last two weeks has big implications for production while Iran nuclear talks trudge on in the background, an imminent deal adding fuel to the fire of oversupply concerns.” The news on Iran added to concerns about demand for oil caused by economic events. Chief among these was the Greek crisis and its potential knock-on effects to the eurozone before gruelling overnight talks resulted in a deal on Monday morning. Investors are also concerned about China, the world’s second-biggest economy. The country’s stock market has been through weeks of turbulence and a 7.5% increase in crude oil imports published on Monday was said to be caused by stockpiling rather than increased demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jan/23/electoral-challenges-for-labour-and-the-left","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-23T19:28:57Z","webTitle":"Electoral challenges for Labour and the left | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/23/electoral-challenges-for-labour-and-the-left","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jan/23/electoral-challenges-for-labour-and-the-left","fields":{"headline":"Electoral challenges for Labour and the left","bodyText":"I was disappointed to read the article “Farron hits out at ‘lame and toxic’ Corbyn” (20 January). Tim Farron needs to stop playing political games. Here in Surrey, where Tories dominate local government at every level, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and other progressive-minded people have been working closely together in our local Compass group for over a year. We do not agree on every issue, but we have built up trust and, as the right consolidates its hold on power both locally and nationally, we are building an alternative and seeking a different way of doing politics: working collaboratively to try and build a more equal, fairer and more sustainable future, focusing on areas of agreement rather than party tribalism. We find it difficult to empathise with Farron, clinging on to his 18% majority in Westmorland and Lonsdale, commanding his mighty army of nine MPs from his ivory tower in the Westminster bubble. The true progressive forces in the land are seeking ways of working together with others on the left and centre-left, rather than relying on the hope of a small group of highly compromised Lib Dem MPs propping up another Tory-led government after the next election. Is this really what Tim Farron wants? Steve Williams Chair, South West Surrey Compass • The fundamental problem in Britain is that a large section of the public believes it is possible to go back to the 1950s and recreate the industrial and social conditions that existed before Asian economies developed their own production capacity (Guy Verhofstadt, Opinion, 19 January). These citizens have suffered from the slow but steady decline in the industries that gave them status and respect – steel, ship-building, mining, textiles and other historic centres of employment. Given that most of these electors consistently voted Labour, even though their views were wildly astray from any brand of socialism, the Labour party’s dependence on their votes meant that it did not dare to expose its policies too clearly. It is the severance of that link by the SNP in Scotland and, increasingly, by Ukip in England that dooms Labour electorally. It has also meant that Labour has not felt able to confront its traditional vote with the facts of life that come with the inexorable rise of globalisation. Leaving the EU or reducing immigration will not assuage the concerns of these electors. The health of our future politics depends of drawing these citizens who feel marginalised and of less worth into a society that values them for what they are as individuals, rather than their earning capacity. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds • Professor Linden West (Letters, 16 January) is correct in his analysis of the background to the forthcoming byelection in Stoke and should be supported in his call for a renewal of this once great industrial and industrious city. It may be worth adding that the trustworthy nature of the workforce in the pottery industry, allied with the pride they took in their work, was disgracefully treated by the paternalistic owner-managers of the industry who, as soon as they could, took production abroad from the 1980s onward and left thousands without work. Their unions were powerless to prevent these closures in the face of the prevailing neoliberal economic policies. At about the same time, the local coal mines were shut and production halted at the Shelton steelworks. Similar stories could be told right across the old industrial areas of Britain. None of this was the fault of the supposedly feckless and workshy. Loyalty, long service and pride in their work was given a good capitalist kick in the teeth. Brexit is part of the misguided payback. David Bishop Nantwich, Cheshire • Labour faces a dilemma in the Copeland byelection, given that the Sellafield reprocessing plant lies within the constituency. This can be resolved by proposing a two-pronged investment programme. Among the wider electorate, public support for nuclear power is consistently below 40%, while two-thirds or more support wind and solar power. Labour should propose to cancel the subsidy for new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point and Moorside. Part of the savings could be used to boost renewables; they can generate more electric power and jobs in Cumbria and Somerset, more quickly and cheaply than nuclear. The remainder of the savings could create new jobs at Sellafield to boost its vital work in finding a safe, secure and politically acceptable solution to the nuclear waste problem.

Whom is it meant to deter, from doing what? There is one large limitation on the credibility of such a deterrent; that its actual use, against a major nuclear Power, would be suicidal. The Soviet Union, China, even the United States, could survive thermo-nuclear attack or counter-attack. This small, densely populated island could not. Since this is obvious, nuclear weapons under British control could not be credibly invoked to deter the Soviet Union from, say, invading Turkey, or Yugoslavia, or indeed India (over which Sir Harold Wilson in one of his wilder fantasies once beheld himself as holding a nuclear umbrella). But does not NATO already provide a fully adequate guarantee of deterrence against that eventuality? There are those who think that America’s nuclear umbrella over Europe is hardly more to be relied on than Sir Harold’s Indian one. Chancellor Schmidt himself is known to be unconvinced that any American government would use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, with the consequential destruction of American cities, for the defence of Europe. If that scepticism is well-founded, then the case for an independent British deterrent cannot be dismissed.

Ministers in the Department of Energy and Climate Change have reached an agreement with the French energy company EDF to develop Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater in Somerset, and are ready to approve the project after parliament’s summer recess. The Guardian understands that David Cameron and China’s president, Xi Jinping, are expected to sign the deal at a meeting in the UK in October. More than two thirds of the upfront investment costs for the controversial project will be provided by two Chinese companies. Beijing is keen to secure a greater stake in further nuclear power plants. Hinkley has faced growing criticism from energy experts, who have questioned the rising costs of the electricity it would generate and whether it is right to subsidise nuclear while cutting money to renewables. Ministers have already paid the London law firm Slaughter and May more than £1.3m for its role in negotiating the final contract for the construction of the reactor. Analysts at HSBC said in a report published last week that Hinkley was “becoming harder to justify”. As part of the contract, EDF and China General Nuclear will be responsible for any cost overruns in the construction of the plant, which is supposed to meet 7% of Britain’s electricity needs. However, once it is in operation the government has agreed to pay £92.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity generated for the 35 years of the contract. This is well above the current wholesale price of electricity, which is about £50 per MWh. The HSBC report said that European wholesale electricity prices are expected to fall from this level over the contract period, resulting in a “huge difference between UK forward prices and the Hinkley price”. This cost will ultimately be paid for in consumer bills. Ministers say the subsidy represents value for money as it is the only realistic way of reducing UK carbon emissions while ensuring a consistency of supply. A senior government source said: “We have always been very clear that nuclear is an important part of our future energy mix. “In the next few years we are going to have to decommission six out of eight of our existing nuclear power plants and we need to replace that generating capacity. “We are now on the verge of signing the contracts with Hinkley and we believe that will unlock further nuclear investment which in turn will reduce costs to consumers.” Sources at EDF confirmed it expected to see contracts signed in the early autumn. Last week the company announced selected preferred bidders for £1.3bn worth of contracts relating to the project. Last month, the Austrian government mounted a legal challenge at the European court of justice against EU-granted subsidies for Hinkley, arguing that it is in breach of EU law and risks distorting the market. Ministers have dismissed the challenge as “weak”. Environmental groups claim that Britain’s future electricity needs could be met by renewables alone. “Instead of locking two generations of consumers into paying over the odds for their electricity, the UK government should invest in the kind of clean energy sources that are getting cheaper by the year, don’t take ages to build and don’t cost billions to clean up,” said Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/28/what-do-we-know-about-hinkley-points-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T18:04:35Z","webTitle":"What do we know about Hinkley Point C's technology?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/what-do-we-know-about-hinkley-points-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/what-do-we-know-about-hinkley-points-technology","fields":{"headline":"What do we know about Hinkley Point C's technology?","bodyText":"Britain’s first new nuclear power station in more than 20 years will contain the industry’s most cutting-edge technology. Hinkley Point C on the Somerset coast will feature two European pressurised reactors (EPRs) designed to be safer, more reliable and more fuel efficient than anything that has gone before. The EPR has been developed by the French companies EDF and Areva. A variant of the pressurised water reactor, it will work in the same fundamental way as previous generations of the device: nuclear fission triggers a chain reaction, producing energy. Water is then heated, producing steam that turns turbines and generates electricity. The technology behind the reactors is meant to be safer than any previous design. Taking lessons from the past – such as 9/11 or the nuclear disaster at Fukushima – EDF claims the EPR is highly resistant to external hazards, with a reinforced core designed to withstand plane crashes, earthquakes and extreme flooding. They will be the most powerful reactors in the world but use less fuel – and produce about a third less waste – than older reactors. They can operate for longer, with less downtime for maintenance. The reactors will be available for more than 90% of their 60-year life, according to EDF. In December 2012, after an extensive review, EPRs were approved for use in the UK by the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency, which confirmed that the reactor met strict safety requirements. But the scale of the reactors and their additional safety features make EPRs highly complex. Today, not a single EPR reactor operates anywhere in the world. Costs have overrun at the Flamanville nuclear plant in France, which is six years behind schedule. In Finland, where another EPR is planned, the picture is even worse: the Olkiluoto reactor is nearly a decade behind and three times over budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/08/edf-decision-hinkley-point-should-be-declared-void-french-unions-government-approval-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T17:27:50Z","webTitle":"EDF decision on Hinkley Point should be declared void, say French unions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/edf-decision-hinkley-point-should-be-declared-void-french-unions-government-approval-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/edf-decision-hinkley-point-should-be-declared-void-french-unions-government-approval-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"EDF decision on Hinkley Point should be declared void, say French unions","bodyText":"EDF’s decision to invest in the £18bn Hinkley Point should be declared invalid, French trade unions have said, as pressure builds against the troubled nuclear power plant project. A trio of unions at the French firm said senior board members knew that the UK government was considering delaying its final decision on Hinkley, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman and chief executive of EDF, sent a letter to fellow board members this month in which he admitted knowing about the probable delay before the board met to approve building and co-funding the first British nuclear power plant in a generation. Theresa May quashed hopes that Hinkley would finally go ahead at last when it was announced that final government approval would be postponed until early autumn. The announcement came just hours before a signing ceremony was scheduled to take place at the site in Somerset, south-west England. The prime minister is thought to have ordered a delay owing to concerns about the role of China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project. Unions said they believed some EDF board members knew the delay was probable, meaning the board’s approval – by 10 votes to seven – should be overturned. “Our three unions denounce this information asymmetry,” said the CGT, CFE-CGC and FO in a joint statement. “They therefore consider that the board’s Hinkley Point decision, taken on the basis of incomplete information, is null and void.” The three unions said the UK government’s supposed desire for a swift resolution had been cited by EDF’s leadership as a key reason to vote in favour of the project. The moderate CFDT union, which also represents EDF employees, did not sign the statement. In his letter to fellow EDF executives Lévy said he believed May only wanted “a few more days” to consider the Hinkley contract amid criticism over the cost to taxpayers. EDF said this week: “Reading the entire internal email sent on 2 August by the chairman and CEO of EDF to members of the executive committee confirms unambiguously that when the company’s board of directors was held, EDF and its chairman had no knowledge of the intention of the British government to conduct a further review of the Hinkley Point project. “All that was known before the press statement issued by the British government on 28 July was that the signing ceremony originally proposed for Friday 29 July would be postponed. “This potential date of signature had not been confirmed, and therefore had not been communicated either to the board nor the market. There was therefore no requirement to communicate its postponement.” EDF added that Lévy planned to sue the Sud Energie union, after it claimed that he lied when he told journalists he did not know the British government was planning to delay the project. The CGT, CFE-CGC and FO unions said not enough consideration was given to whether EDF board members were subject to a conflict of interest, because some are employed by companies that stand to benefit from Hinkley. “Who can say that with a rigorous management of the conflicts of interest and real transparency of information, the board decision would not have been different,” the unions said. Peter Atherton, an associate at Cornwall Energy consultants, said: “It would seem that communication between the two parties [the UK government and EDF] wasn’t the best.” He added that the cost of underwriting the project for UK taxpayers was excessive, after the government agreed a guaranteed price for electricity produced by Hinkley. “My position is that the economics of Hinkley are very hard to justify. The question is whether there are other benefits, such as the relationship with the French and Chinese and the industrial development you get from that, as well as economic benefits to the south-west.” Critics of Hinkley have argued that it is not good value for money because the government is offering EDF – which is 85%-owned by the French state – a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour to provide up to 7% of the UK’s energy needs. Atherton said: “The political will in the UK may have diminished now that George Osborne isn’t involved. The issue is whether the whole thing is being called into question.” Oliver Salvesen, equity analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said there was still enough support for Hinkley within EDF for the project to go ahead, assuming the UK government chooses to support it. “It is surprising that the company can’t marry these two factions together. It’s a function of the fact that EDF has been very financially stressed because of poor market conditions,” he said. “The unions are very powerful and they’ll want to know that the company isn’t taking on unnecessary risk with an investment that could impact the French business and of course, the workforce. But this is a long-term project that they want to be involved with and will give very decent returns.” The UK government is conducting a review of the Hinkley Pointcontract, but it has not made public its scope of the review. May is thought to have been keen to examine more closely the role of Chinese companies in the project amid concerns about the impact on national security and despite her predecessor David Cameron’s strong support for Hinkley."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2016/oct/30/humans-new-series-two-gemma-chan","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-30T08:59:04Z","webTitle":"Humans: Hollyoaks with hard drives or smart political sci-fi?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/30/humans-new-series-two-gemma-chan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/30/humans-new-series-two-gemma-chan","fields":{"headline":"Humans: Hollyoaks with hard drives or smart political sci-fi?","bodyText":"From Black Mirror to Westworld, television drama is asking some difficult questions about modern technology, morality, sex and freedom at the moment. Namely, have we slid far enough into the abyss to start banging robots yet? Series two of sci-fi drama Humans (Sunday, 9pm, Channel 4) might have the answer. A woman in one of those tight leather jackets favoured by 18-year-old baristas is in a trendy Berlin club. Her glassy stare and stiff arms suggest another mashed-up tourist, stumbling around Alexanderplatz. But wait, hold on: now she’s doing a very slow, single-handed version of The Robot in front of a speaker. And now she’s talking to a friendly lesbian with a top bun. Now they’re going home together. Oh look, and now she’s covering the robot power button punctured into her stomach with a plaster... The first series of Humans covered everything from sex and housework to memory and freedom as a group of “synths”, working within the human world, gradually achieved sentience, using their newfound intelligence to instigate a rebellion against their makers. As season two opens, Niska, played by Emily Berrington, has unplugged herself from the mainframe long enough to enjoy a European mini-break and wake up her cyborg siblings, pausing occasionally to lounge on the sofa with her new (human) partner. It would be all too easy to dismiss Humans as Hollyoaks with hard drives; a glossy-haired look at what happens when androids become able to think for themselves. Its synths resemble the final round of a Topshop casting call and the plot is often soapier than a foam party. Yet there’s more to it than that. The show lightly brushes against many contemporary issues: a newly awakened synth who was working in a Bolivian coal mine is said to have “hidden on ships and lorries” to get to England. He is, in that sense, our first sci-fi refugee. God help us if the Daily Mail get hold of the story; Jack Straw will probably want to start measuring the diameter of his metal dental frame to guess just how old he really is. Gemma Chan’s beguiling performance as a mopping waitress in a seaside cafe screams silently of the poor working conditions in our service industry; while a human father (Tom Goodman-Hill) getting made redundant to increase the efficiency of a small packing warehouse can’t help but remind viewers of the drone-tracked ruthlessness of Amazon and its ilk. Which isn’t to say Humans is merely earnest. The plot still gallops along like Champion the Wonder Horse. Over its 45-minute running time, we see Niska inch further towards free will, while the other liberated synths run around gently rusting industrial sites looking by turns stiff and seductive. Hester, a synth from a nuclear power plant, goes rogue and narrowly avoids setting off Nottingham’s own version of Three Mile Island, while the inevitable star-cross’d love story between synth Anita (Chan) and human-synth hybrid Leo (Colin Morgan) bounces on like a ball bearing dropped down a fire escape. Does Humans succeed as sci-fi? Well – in the sense that all good science fiction uses a flimsy filter of androids, aliens and fluorescent goo to stare down the U-bend of contemporary politics – yes. It examines immigration, consent, workers’ rights and morality, all through the extended metaphor of robots. Sexy robots. The sort of sexy robots you’d be happy to encounter on a dancefloor in Berlin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/28/edf-to-give-green-light-to-hinkley-point-project","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T08:31:47Z","webTitle":"EDF set to give green light to Hinkley Point nuclear project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/edf-to-give-green-light-to-hinkley-point-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/edf-to-give-green-light-to-hinkley-point-project","fields":{"headline":"EDF set to give green light to Hinkley Point nuclear project","bodyText":"The French energy company EDF is expected to give the go-ahead for an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. EDF’s board will meet in Paris on Thursday and is almost certain to approve the project – the UK’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. The decision to proceed will be criticised by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, which have called for more investment in renewable energy sources. But unions will welcome the much-delayed project because it will create 25,000 construction jobs. Hinkley Point C will provide 7% of the UK’s electricity over its estimated 60-year lifespan and is scheduled to go online in 2025 – several years later than planned. That timetable could be highly optimistic given it will use the same reactor design as a plant being built in Flamanville, France, which is years behind schedule and more than three times over budget. Also France’s nuclear safety authority has found weaknesses in the reactor’s steel. The delay in approving Hinkley Point has been largely due to concerns about EDF’s financial health, which has been compounded by the burden of the Flamanville project. French unions have warned that the company – 85% owned by the French government – could be ruined by the cost of the UK project. EDF has sought a partner to spread the burden and China General Nuclear Power Corporation is expected to take a 33% stake in the project. EDF said recently that Hinkley Point was a “unique asset for French industry as it would benefit the whole of the nuclear industry and support employment in major companies and smaller enterprises in the sector”. Speaking on Thursday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the former Lib Dem energy secretary Chris Huhne said the project was worthwhile, not least as the main risks were being carried by EDF. He said: “It’s certainly a risk for EDF, because the nuclear industry has not delivered a power plant on time or on budget anywhere in the world for years and years.” But Huhne said EDF and the French government had a strong interest in delivering the plant. “The reality is, if they can make Hinkley Point work, and they can finally crack producing these things on time and on budget, there’s a potential market there in a low-carbon world which could be very valuable to French industry,” he said. Tom Burke, from the environmental group E3G, told the programme that Hinkley Point was a huge waste of money. “There is no doubt we need the electricity,” he said. “We just don’t need electricity from Hinkley, at enormous cost, very unreliably. We’ve much better ways in which we could achieve the security of supply that we need at affordable cost and in a low-carbon way, without going to this sort of trouble.” But Huhne argued that, at least in the short term, the UK needed nuclear energy to augment any move to renewable sources. “The reality is that in the northern hemisphere, when it comes to January and February we have amazingly high demand for energy and our ability to produce it from intermittent renewables is, at the very best, variable.” The business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, said last week: “New nuclear is an essential part of our plan for a secure, clean and affordable energy system that will power the economy throughout this century.” Unite urged the EDF board to approve the project, which the union said will generate thousands of skilled jobs and help meet the UK’s energy needs for decades to come. Kevin Coyne, Unite’s national officer for energy, said: “The cost of not doing so could result in the lights going out in Britain and the West Country missing out on the much-needed economic boost that this major infrastructure project would bring. Workers are shovel ready and raring to go – all they need is the green light from the EDF board.” Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “Energy margins for the UK continue to decline and we need to take the practical steps which ensure that we keep the lights on and transition to low-carbon generation. A final investment decision will be good for jobs, good for consumers, good for the environment and good for the economy.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: “Every time EDF has tried to build a reactor like Hinkley, it has failed. There isn’t a shred of evidence that Hinkley can be built on time or on budget, and if it hits the same problems as its predecessors, it can’t be relied on to keep the lights on in the UK. “The UK government doesn’t have to sign the contract with the French and Chinese state-owned nuclear companies. We need to invest in reliable home-grown renewable energy like offshore wind which is powering other northern European countries more cheaply than Hinkley, even taking into account the backup cost when the wind doesn’t blow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/dec/09/new-battery-plants-scheduled-to-keep-uk-lights-on","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-09T18:24:39Z","webTitle":"New battery power-storage plants scheduled to keep UK lights on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/new-battery-plants-scheduled-to-keep-uk-lights-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/dec/09/new-battery-plants-scheduled-to-keep-uk-lights-on","fields":{"headline":"New battery power-storage plants scheduled to keep UK lights on","bodyText":"A series of new battery power-storage plants and two small new gas power stations will be built in the UK following the award of subsidies designed to bolster energy supply and head off the threat of shortages. But government hopes of an ambitious “dash for gas” were dealt another blow after this week’s auction of subsidies to build backup capacity for Britain’s energy network. No new gas power station of a significant scale won a subsidy contract in the bidding process, where companies and technologies competed to provide backup power for the lowest price during the winter of 2020-21. However, the British Gas owner, Centrica, won support for a small-scale gas power plant to be built by 2019 at King’s Lynn in Norfolk. An extension will also be added to US company InterGen’s gas plant in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Analysts at Barclays banking group said: “Overall we believe the auction will largely be viewed as a disappointment by the UK government in terms of securing the significant levels of new gas generation capacity they hoped for in order to ensure security of supply.” The bank said that to encourage big new gas plants, capacity in the auction needed to be sold at £35-£45 per kilowatt, rather than the £22.50 reached. The auction saw 52GW of capacity purchased through government subsidies in a process overseen by National Grid, the UK power system operator. Flexitricity, a business that works with companies which commit to cutting power demand when supply is tight, said the auction results showed the government needed to rethink its push for new gas. “After three years, the capacity market has still failed to deliver a single new-build CCGT [gas plant],” said the company’s founder, Dr Alastair Martin. Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the ECIU thinktank, said: “If ministers really want to incentivise new gas build, they may need something different from the capacity market in its current form.” Batteries took a much larger share than in previous years, with about 500MW awarded to new storage plants being built by EDF, Centrica and smaller companies. Such facilities can provide electricity in seconds to keep the lights from going out, compared with gas plants such as the new one at King’s Lynn, which would take more than 40 minutes to supply electricity when called upon if, for instance, it is not windy enough to power windfarms. “Smaller embedded generators, including batteries, were the big winners in this auction,” said Tom Edwards, an analyst at Cornwall Energy. Green groups welcomed the news that government auction had led to diesel generators, which have been accused of causing noise and air pollution, winning a smaller share than in previous years. But they were disappointed that coal still fared well – winning a tenth of backup capacity – despite the government’s promises to phase out the polluting fuel by 2025. Existing large coal, gas and nuclear power stations will provide 85% of backup power in 2020-21. Rebecca Williams, an energy expert at conservation campaign group WWF, said: “I do think there is a real danger of coal continuing to linger round on the system, crowding out investment in the more flexible generation our system needs.” She urged the government to restrict coal’s access to the capacity market in future, to avoid undercutting investment in other “more attractive” forms of flexible capacity. ScottishPower, which had hoped to win contracts for new large gas power stations, said it was disappointed that coal had won so much capacity. “Diesel was the winner last year, and coal is the winner this year. Clearing 20 times more old coal than new gas signals a willingness to sweat these assets until the bitter end,” said Neil Clitheroe, the company’s global retail director. This week’s auction, the third so far under the capacity market, will cost consumers £15 a household in 2020-21 as energy users shoulder the cost of the subsidies. The government said energy supply was being secured at a “low cost” to bill-payers. Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, said: “This is about more than just keeping the lights on. A modern, reliable and flexible electricity system powers the economy and Britain’s future success.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/24/friday-briefing-win-one-lose-one-for-labour-in-byelections","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T06:57:25Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Win one, lose one for Labour in byelections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/friday-briefing-win-one-lose-one-for-labour-in-byelections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/24/friday-briefing-win-one-lose-one-for-labour-in-byelections","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: Win one, lose one for Labour in byelections","bodyText":"Top story: Labour party ousted in Copeland but holds Stoke Hello, Warren Murray here, bringing you the pick of the news this morning. In a night of mixed fortunes for Labour, the party won the Stoke-on-Trent Central byelection, seeing off a challenge from Ukip in the shape of its leader, Paul Nuttall. But there was a bruising defeat for Jeremy Corbyn in Copeland, where the Tories snatched away a seat dominated by Labour since 1924. “We’ve had Labour here for more than 80 years but it’s been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t represent them,” said Trudy Harrison, the Tory winner, after her victory was announced. Gillian Troughton, Labour’s Copeland candidate, was not helped by her leader’s perceived hostility to nuclear power, a major local employer. The news was brighter for Corbyn in Stoke-on-Trent Central, where Ukip’s Nuttall failed to crack into the Commons after a campaign dogged by his PR debacle over the Hillsborough disaster. The way forward for the anti-EU party seems unclear. The Labour victor, Gareth Snell, said: “The city lazily dubbed by some as the capital of Brexit has once again proven to the world that we are so much more than that.” * * * ‘Chemical weapon’ killed Kim Jong-nam – The nerve agent VX – a weapon of mass destruction banned worldwide – was used to murder the exiled brother of North Korea’s ruler, Malaysian authorities have said. Kim Jong-nam was doused with the world’s deadliest nerve agent after being grabbed from behind in Kuala Lumpur airport, according to test results. Kim Jong-un is showing his foes he means business, writes Julian Borger. * * * SOS: save our squirrels – The Wildlife Trust is seeking 5,000 volunteers to help stop Britain’s native red squirrels being completely wiped out by their introduced grey cousins in as little as 35 years. Trapping and “dispatching” greys is part of the programme and it’s “not everyone’s cup of tea”, the Trust admits. But other jobs include setting up cameras, monitoring squirrel numbers and behaviour, and helping with educational programmes. * * * Running on sugar – Children are consuming the equivalent of five doughnuts’ or 20 chocolate chip biscuits’ worth of the sweet stuff a day, anti-obesity campaigners have warned. The Obesity Health Alliance says food companies need to help reduce the average 73g sugar intake of children and young people. At the individual level here’s some helpful advice from the people who manage to get down 10 portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day. * * * ‘Maniacally focused’ – Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist, has declared Donald Trump an “economic nationalist” bent on defeating the “corporatist, globalist media” to achieve his aims. After Bannon’s speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), one analyst said it seemed to confirm “we are getting [Bannon’s] ideas coming out of Donald Trump’s mouth to a great extent”. Separately, Luke Harding’s video explainer on what we know about Donald Trump and Russia is enlightening. * * * Degree of speed – The government wants to lift the £9,000 annual tuition fee cap so university students can complete undergraduate studies in two years instead of three. Yearly fees would rise to more than £13,000 but the “fast-track degrees” would cost the same overall, and have the same academic standing.

Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF, said he needed more financial support from the Elysée Palace to proceed with construction of the plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. A letter sent to the company’s staff admits the “tense” financial situation at EDF and the potential danger to a scheme that is at the centre of British energy policy. “We are negotiating with the [French] state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position. It is clear that I will not engage in this EDF project as long as these conditions are not met,” said Lévy. Pressure on the EDF bosss increased last week when his finance director resigned, saying Hinkley needed to be postponed for at least three years while the company restructured its finances. French trade unions on its board, angry at planned job cuts in France, have also called for Hinkley to be shelved. Those concerns were echoed on Thursday by country’s top public auditor, which warned over the cost and complexity of the project. Explaining why he was taking the usual step of addressing staff, Lévy said: “In recent weeks, our group is the subject of much debate, especially around the renewal of our nuclear fleet and the construction of two EPR [European pressurised reactors] in the UK at Hinkley Point C. “You know, the financial situation is tense, and this issue deserves to be clarified. I receive your messages of encouragement, but I also hear some concerns. That is why I address myself directly to you.” Despite the problems facing the group, Lévy underlined both his and the French government’s desire to make the Hinkley project successful. “Hinkley Point C has the support of the French government and the British government, which places it at the heart of new nuclear energy policy. The UK needs to secure its supply of electricity and decarbonise its energy mix.” Referring to the British government subsidy for the project, represented by a guaranteed electricity price of £92.50/MWh , he added: “I am convinced of the robustness of the guaranteed selling price, approved by Brussels.” EDF’s share price has slumped and its debts have risen over recent years. It has also been hit by falling energy prices and demands from the French government that it took over ailing nuclear engineering group Areva. Its difficulties have put enormous pressure on the British government, which has already promised generous financial subsidies for Hinkley, to be paid for by taxpayers. The subsidy agreements have drawn scorn from investment bankers in the City. One analyst earlier this week described the Hinkley project as “insane” because of the problems EDF and Areva had experienced at similar schemes at Flamanville in Normandy and Olkiluoto in Finland. The Japanese prime minister at the time of the Fukushima nuclear accident has warned that nuclear power is unsafe and too expensive to justify building new plants anywhere in the world. Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the disaster on Friday, Naoto Kan said he was against the idea of Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi and Toshiba building nuclear plants in the UK. “Nuclear power is not safe. In the worst case scenario up to 50 million people would have had to be evacuated. Nuclear power is not a suitable technology and renewable power is much better,” Kan told the Guardian. He insisted he did not want to tell other countries such as Britain what to do but said he did not support the reactors being switched back on in Japan. Neither did he support the idea of Japanese companies working on new nuclear schemes. While EDF is at the centre of the Hinkley scheme, Hitachi and Toshiba are behind similar initiatives being developed for new reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, Oldbury in south Gloucestershire, and Sellafield in Cumbria. Kan said it did not make sense to construct new atomic plants because of the cost, especially in those countries where there were no long-term storage facilities for high-level radioactive waste. This includes Britain and Japan. “What I experienced as prime minister made me feel that it does not make sense to rely on nuclear. New generation plant designs are supposed to increase safety but all these do is increase the cost,” he added. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of Britain’s atomic lobby group, the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said he was comfortable that Hinkley and the other reactors being planned in Britain would be safe because they would go through the UK’s most rigorous regulatory scrutiny. “The process of assessing the reactor design is done in a different way in the UK and that gives confidence that the reactor design [EDF’s European pressurised reactors] will be safe and that is what we need to see,” he said. A spokesperson from the Department of Energy and Climate Change said the safety of British reactors would be paramount. “Any nuclear power station built in the UK will need to comply with our world-leading nuclear safety regulation. “The British government is backing new nuclear. It is an important part of our plan to give hardworking families and businesses clean, affordable and secure energy that they can rely on now and in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2020/feb/10/nationals-coalition-liberals-queensland-morrison-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-10T07:19:52Z","webTitle":"Fallout from the Nationals leadership spill continues – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/10/nationals-coalition-liberals-queensland-morrison-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/10/nationals-coalition-liberals-queensland-morrison-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Fallout from the Nationals leadership spill continues – as it happened","bodyText":"On that note, we are going to, as Murph would say, land the plane and close the blog for the night. We’ll be back early tomorrow morning, when all the parties meet to discuss policy, strategy, and, if you are the Nationals, how to stay together. Llew O’Brien will have had his chat to the prime minister by then. He’ll be in joint party room, but not the Nationals party room. Which again, is not a punishment. It does rob him of the chance to do something about the leadership, which is the reason he left the party in the first place, but it doesn’t do anything else in terms of government numbers. It just reinforces how divided the Nats still are. Although, I would pay good money to see Damian Drum’s reaction in the party room tomorrow. The man isn’t exactly known for being a wallflower. Plus, Ken O’Dowd has probably done himself out of the deputy whip position, given he admitted on national television that he had voted against the party line, despite his job being to keep everyone toeing the party line. I haven’t had this many giggles since my dad fell into a pond at my wedding while singing the Banana Boat Day-O song and lost his car keys. Thank you to everyone who joined us today. We will be back early tomorrow. You can catch me on Twitter or Instagram in the meantime. Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy will all be back as well, along with the rest of the Guardian brains trust. Thanks again – and take care of you. So, in conclusion, the Nationals leader’s pick for the deputy speaker position was gazumped by a Labor troll, after the rogue Nats’ plan to fleece Michael McCormack, led by Barnaby Joyce, and put Ken O’Dowd in place of Damian Drum was scuttled. What does it mean? Nothing other than the man who has led the charge against McCormack, Llew O’Brien, gets a pay rise, and McCormack has once again, and quite publicly, had his authority over his party shot to pieces. And that last bit is what is going to cost him long term. As sincere as a Kardashian therapy session: “Sam, the first night at BED when you left, Rob...” The Greens also have a production of documents order on this report – which also wants the emails between PMO and Bridget McKenzie. That one is due to be ignored by Thursday. Jacqui Lambie is very, very angry over Mathias Cormann’s use of cabinet-in-confidence to stop the tabling of the PM&amp;C report in the Senate. Lambie says this is why the public can’t trust politicians. “Does he take us all for morons,” she says, adding that the prime minister doesn’t “have the guts” to table the report. Just a reminder that Llew O’Brien’s salary boost for becoming deputy speaker is worth about three years of Newstart. Apparently Labor’s Julian Hill almost missed casting his ballot because he was taking a photo of it to troll the government, and then forgot it under his iPad. He found it, signalled the clerks, there was a discussion, and then it was counted. Not that it mattered in the end – 75 to 67 is a comprehensive win. Over in the Senate, which shockingly is the sane chamber lately, Mathias Cormann will have to front up to explain why the government won’t be complying with the Senate order to produce the Phil Gaetjen’s report into why the sports grant affair is hunky dory. It was due on Thursday. It was not produced. They’ll call it cabinet-in-confidence, so you won’t get it for 20 years, even though other reports into ministerial conduct have been released. You like me, and I like it all We like dancing and we look divine You love bands when they’re playing hard You want more and you want it fast They put you down, they say I’m wrong Ken O’Dowd is also the Nationals deputy whip. Not sure he can hold on to that position, having just admitted he voted against the party line on national TV. Ken O’Dowd logic: Barnaby is considered in Queensland nearly a Queenslander. I know he was born in New South Wales but he has spent a lot of his life in Queensland. When I first met him he was a senator for Queensland. I still get him sometimes as a Queenslander. I am still laughing. Honestly. At this point, the Nationals couldn’t organise a piss-up in a brewery. Looking at those numbers, it looks like, if we consider the crossbench voting with Labor, another five government MPs came over to the Labor vote. 75 would equal 64 Labor MPs, plus six in the crossbench, plus five government MPs. So Ken O’Dowd is a yes. Barnaby Joyce is most likely a yes. Llew O’Brien is a yes. Who are the other two? Asked by Patricia Karvelas why some in the Nationals are so upset with Michael McCormack: If it wasn’t for central Queensland and the seats around Flynn, we wouldn’t be in government today. I don’t think that has been recognised fully by the National party. We wanted more representation in ... with the Coalition. This is another step forward, as far as I’m concerned. The new deputy leader of the Nationals is a Queenslander. Keith Pitt is now in the cabinet. There are only 21 Nats. I am not sure how much more Queensland representation they want, but hey – LET’S FIND OUT. Llew O’Brien (thanks to a blog watcher for the transcription): It is a tremendous privilege to be in this place. Every election we put ourselves forward to our constituents to serve them in the most honest and best way we can. I’m privileged to be here. As a country policeman, I find it incredible that I can walk into this place and take part in this. It’s an honour to serve the people of Wide Bay and it will be an honour to serve this House as deputy Speaker. Ken O’Dowd tells Patricia Karvelas that Barnaby Joyce was going to nominate him for deputy speaker, despite the party room vote, but ahead of the vote this afternoon, O’Dowd told him not to, to help with party unity. But then he voted against what the party wanted, because (extreme Billy Moore voice) QUEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNSSSSSSLLLLLLANNNNNDER O’Dowd, who once said he would be willing to step up as deputy prime minister and leader of the Nats if he was called upon (narrator: he was never, and would never, be called upon. There aren’t enough evens to can’t for that to happen) says he thinks Barnaby Joyce should come back as leader of the Nationals, because he still thinks of him as a Queenslander as well. Queensland – it is the greatest nation on earth. (I can say that, because I grew up there and I am allowed.) Ken O’Dowd is telling Patricia Karvelas he voted for Llew O’Brien over Michael McCormack’s pick. Fortune favours the brave. He was brave enough to call the challenge last week. He followed up with divorcing the National party, which I thought was a pretty bold move. As I just said, fortune favours the brave. But I didn’t support him. PK: What did you say you did support him? So you did support him today. Yes. Why? O’Dowd: Barnaby has made a few points and I was bowled over by Damian and the party room this morning because I stood for the deputy speaker too. I was beaten in a fair ballot. That remains the same. It was good to see that Llew O’Brien, who comes from Queensland, he is only a couple of doors away from where I live and I know he will do a good job. It is good to have one of our own in that position. Happy for him and happy to Queensland. We can’t be all Victoria and NSW. PK: I want to get to the bottom of this. Damian Drum won the nomination but you didn’t vote for the person the Nationals wanted to be the deputy speaker? O’Dowd: It was the party room that wanted Damian as opposed to myself. Then Llew O’Brien was also a Queenslander, LNP, I am LNP, really take my hat off to Llew for making a stand. Fortune favours the brave. He was brave enough to make those steps. He made them. Fully realising the consequences of those steps. Look at that. Came out in front. Good on the underdog. All the Labor MPs are shaking Llew O’Brien’s hand as they leave. Michael McCormack had promised Damian Drum the role following the leadership spill. It is always confirmed by a vote of the parliament, but once again, the Coalition underestimated Labor’s tactical abilities. They are just better at this sort of stuff, because they practice on each other through factional battles. Also, Llew O’Brien just received a $42,000 payrise for quitting the Nationals party room AND got revenge against McCormack. Not a bad day’s work. Michael McCormack’s candidate for (deputy) speaker just got rolled in a house wide vote. I actually can’t stop laughing. This may be his greatest gift to the parliament. Llew O’Brien is on duty at 7pm tonight. So guess he won’t be meeting with the prime minister tonight then. Scott Morrison: Can I congratulate the member. With two government members to choose from I’m pleased to see government members received the full confidence of all the member for the House. The member and his experience that he brings to this House – I more than most have an understanding of what he brings to this House, as I do also understand what the member for Nichols brings to this House, Mr Speaker. There is no shortage of government members in this House to make sure that we continue to deliver on the promises we made the Australian people, Mr Speaker. These government members will continue to make sure that a strong economy saves Australia, and a government that will continue to meet the needs of the Australian people will be delivered on each and every day that this government majority serves in this House. Anthony Albanese: No amount of marketing or spin can hide the humiliation for the government. I congratulate the member for Wide Bay on receiving such strong support from his colleagues in the House of Representatives. I asked the question earlier today, the first question of Question Time, to the stability of the government. We have just seen the stability of the Coalition on all of you. On full view. For everyone to see, government members running against each other, for a position of deputy speaker of the House of Representatives. Albanese moves on to congratulate O’Brien. Michael McCormack: “I congratulate the member and I know he’ll do a good job ... that’s democracy.” Tony Smith is attempting to work out if Llew O’Brien still counts as a member of the government. He hasn’t read the O’Brien stories today. I have clearly stated that I am still a member of the government, I do not sit as a National party member, I sit as a member of the LNP, which is what I put forward to the people of Wide Bay,” says O’Brien. So there you go. It is official. Michael McCormack looks like he has just read this blog. Scott Morrison is congratulating McCormack. “There is no shortage of government members in this House to ensure that we continue to deliver for the people of Australia,” Morrison says, pointing out that two government MPs were up for election. Anthony Albanese says “no amount of marketing and spin can hide the humiliation from that vote” and then congratulates Llew O’Brien on his comprehensive win. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Llew O’Brien is the new deputy speaker. The votes have been counted Damian Drum: 67 Llew O’Brien: 75 George Christensen has put up a new statement on Facebook, in response to his “inner city Liberal” criticism earlier this morning. I will always stand up for local workers, local businesses, local farmers and local industry, no matter if it’s the Greens, Labor or my own side trying to talk down our opportunity to prosper with new affordable and reliable clean coal-fired power. This is presented with the caveat that there is a very, very low bar for excitement in this place. Australian variety TV low Sorry, as corrected by Paul Karp – if the crossbench votes with Labor, then you only need two from the government. One would think that Llew O’Brien would vote for himself, so that would mean one more vote for O’Brien. As seen by Mike Bowers: Barnaby saw a Llew: The crossbench saw one too: It’s a secret ballot. For Labor’s troll to work here (one Llew O’Brien has very enthusiastically picked up) the crossbench would have to vote with Labor, along with three government MPs. Not impossible, but also not likely. Still. Stranger things have happened in this place. Llew O’Brien has accepted the nomination, formally. This is almost as great as Parasite winning best picture. Excellent news The deputy speaker role comes with an additional 20% of the base wage, which is $211,250 a year. That’s an extra $42,000 or so. Tony Smith is dealing with practice issues – usually the nominees for deputy speaker have to accept the nomination. Llew O’Brien isn’t in the chamber, so Smith is trying to work out if he accepts Labor’s nomination. The nominee doesn’t have to be present at the election, or inform the House of whether or not they accept the nomination – but Smith will ask if he makes it to the House for the vote. Tony Burke is now trolling the government by nominating Llew O’Brien for the role. Damian Drum will be the new deputy speaker. It’s kinda cute that the parliament is pretending that this is a proper election and not something that was stitched up in the joint party room. The folders were stacked – and now question time is over. Anthony Albanese to Alan Tudge: My question is addressed to the acting minister for immigration, and it goes to his last answer where he ignored the $165,000 donation from a private company, which seeks to, to quote him, “build and operate the visa system”. I say to the minister: If it looks like a privatisation and smells like a privatisation, why won’t the minister concede that this is privatisation of our visa system by a major donor and mate of the prime minister? Christian Porter attempts to stop the question, but Tony Smith rules it in order: Tudge: I can only just reiterate that it is not a privatisation because the government will remain responsible for all of the key national security decisions, the risk assessment, the visa policy, the business rules and all of the key functions of government. In that regard, this model, which we have been going through an expression of interest process through, is precisely the same as the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which, when Labor was in government for those six, long years, they ran and they were quite happy with that process under way. And 30% of all visas today go through the Electronic Visa Authority. So, clearly, the Labor party did not have a great problem with that model when they were in government but now today they are seeking to politicise this system. They didn’t make the decision to upgrade the visa processing system because they didn’t have the money to do so. We’ve made the decision to do so, and we will go through it in a methodical, professional way, doing the things that governments should be doing. Andrew Giles to Scott Morrison: Does the Prime Minister plan to proceed with the privatisation of Australia’s visa system in light of revelations that his mate, Scott Briggs, spent last year leading a group trying to buy the visa group while spending $165,000 to the Liberal party? Alan Tudge gets this one: Let me point out that we are not privatising the visa system – far from it. Rather, several years ago we decided that we needed to upgrade our visa processing capabilities ... because the visa processing capabilities are about 25 years old and unable to do some of the modern functionality which we would like. Furthermore, given the growth in the visa applications, are projected by a further 35% over the next 10 years to 13 million visa applications each year, it is clearly timely to be examining whether or not to upgrade the visa processing system. So we’ve actually been out to the market to see who would partner with the government to build the new capability. And under the model, that’s partners would build and operate the platform. But this is the important piece ... the government would always retain the responsibility, as they do today, for all visa decision-making. It would determine the business rules and how decisions are made. It would remain responsible for national security and other risk assessments, and it would be overall responsible, on an ongoing basis, for visa policy. In this regard, this model is actually very similar to the model which we already have in place called the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which about 30% of all visas are processed, and that model itself was in place all throughout the Labor years, which did not change. It was precisely that model whereby there was a partner which assists in the visa processing, but the government remains at all times responsible for the business rules, for the risk assessment, for the policy, and for all of the major decisions. Now, Mr Speaker, the process for selecting the partners here has not been completed yet. There is still a process which is under way, but I repeat that we do need to upgrade our visa processing systems at some stage soon, given the age of those systems and given how many visas we are getting every single year, and that’s just increasing. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister support providing $300 million of taxpayer funds to keep the Liddell power station open only for three more years, even though a leaked taskforce report says such an extension would not provide any guarantee of reliability, and defer private investment in new generation? Angus Taylor gets the nod: I’m awaiting the final report of the Liddell taskforce. I won’t pre-empt the outcome of that report. Once we received that report, once we have received it, we’ll consider its recommendation. But we’ve been clear all the way along. And as generators come to the end of their natural lives. We want to see life extension or like for like replacement. This is all about replacement. This is all about adding in more supply to the electricity market whilst we ensure that the existing supply is managed very carefully. And we are seeing results. We have now seen four consecutive quarters in reduction in retail electricity prices, for the first time in recorded history. ... As I was saying, four consecutive quarters of electricity price reductions in the CPI, 3.5% reduction. We have also seen that in the last three months, Mr Speaker, compared to the same period last year, we’ve seen 35% reductions in wholesale electricity prices in the national electricity market, 35% reductions. Queensland, 30%. South Australia, 50%. Victoria 38%. Tasmania, 32%, and Queensland 4%, to an average of 35%. And we will ensure, we will work with the energy companies to make sure this is passed through to electricity consumers because the big stick legislation ensures the substantial and sustained savings, and reductions in costs must be passed through to consumers, and we are achieving all of this while we meet and beat our Kyoto Paris targets. And why are we seeing reductions in energy prices? Could it be that a buttload (the official measurement) of renewables have come onto the grid? Could it? The answer, dear readers, is yes. It is. Peter Dutton is back with just how safe are you, Australia: Indonesia cooperation edition. You are as safe as the government can make you, kittens. Which is much, much safer than anyone could ever have made you, ever. Fiona Phillips to Scott Morrison: A local business in my electorate, Rob’s Bait and Tackle, has lost 80% of their income for the year as a direct result of the fires. This small family business and many others are reluctant to pile on debt at a time when they have very little income. Will the government provide grants for businesses like this, instead of loans that increase their debt? Morrison: That is is a devastating loss of income for that business. I would be very pleased if you can pass on their details. I make them available to the head of the national bushfire recovery agency and see what measures, additional measures, they may not be able to be aware of, to assist them specifically to their circumstances. A range of questions put forward by the opposition today that are seeking a change to the assessment for these grants. I note that’s what you’re suggesting. There should be a change. I would invite the leader of the opposition to write to me and set out the changes to the grant guidelines that he is proposing, Mr Speaker. And I will happily have those assessed by the Department of Finance and I’ll be able to advise the House about the outcome and we can assess the feasibility of the proposal they are making. I invite them to put that proposal in writing to us. Either there is a new spirit of bipartisanship in the chamber, or the prime minister just asked the opposition to come up with policy for him. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Last Friday on the south coast of New South Wales, I was told about the collapse in tourism income over the peak earning period for small businesses. Has the prime minister received the same response that we heard firsthand, that his government’s marketing campaign is not cutting through? Josh Frydenberg gets the nod: I find it amusing coming from the shadow minister, a question about small business, when 62,000 closed their doors in their last year in office, Mr Speaker. 62,000 and over the last year, 75,000. [Labor’s final year in office was the global financial crisis]. Now the reality is that small businesses will have access to half a million dollars in working capital, Mr Speaker, as the prime minister said, two years interest free, and then the interest rate will be half the 10-year commonwealth bond rate, Mr Speaker. Half the 10-year commonwealth bond rate. The reality is that small businesses have been damaged by the fires will get grants up to $50,000 and we’re working through the states. Primary industries. ... $76 million we have announced for tourism to help create jobs in the tourism sector and deal with what has been a [devastated] sector, by not only the ongoing drought, but these devastating bushfires. We have announced a significant package of measures to small business, and over the last reported year, we have seen 75,000 small businesses created. Our focus is on helping the tourism sector get back on its feet. It is really, really rare that Barnaby Joyce actually speaks for the nation Labor’s second set of questions is about the female facilities and water safety stream program, which gave $150m with no guidelines on eligibility. Labor highlights that Scott Morrison had promised “further details” on the program which never materialised. Sport minister Richard Colbeck first defends the OG sports rorts fund – the community sports infrastructure grant program – by noting it was oversubscribed. Colbeck then moved on to female facilities and water safety – noting the health department is using standard CDG (capital development guidelines) “to deliver grants that were subject of election promises”. He said that Labor had committed $250m to sports facilities. The general point is: there didn’t need to be any application process, because the government had already cherry-picked which projects were going to get money if they won. Honestly, looking for sense in a Michael McCormack answer is as useless as searching for meaning in a Diplo song. Michael McCormack appears to be malfunctioning in answer to a Terri Butler question about building dams. He seems only able to say “getting on with the jobs” and “dams” and other words, which, if you squint, may approximate a sentence. But there is a bit of Blu Tack on the roof, which suddenly seems exceptionally interesting. White bread: Those opposite, Mr Speaker, when they were in power, they just wanted to take water away from our irrigators. We want to give them more water. We do that by capturing water when it falls. We had a lot of it just this weekend. We want to make sure that when water falls, whether it’s in the north, wherever it is in the country, we can capture it, we can store it, we can harness it, we can harvest it for when it is dry. And even, I’m sure, the Greens leader, the former ALP branch member, Mr Speaker, he’ll understand that too. He’ll understand that too. There’s nobody more committed to building dams than, Mr Speaker, our regional members on this side of the house. Because we understand the great economic capacity it will be for our nation, the great economic boost it will be for our regional areas, and we’ll get on with the job. We are getting on with the job. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Last Thursday night, while visiting bushfire-affected communities on the south coast of New South Wales, I met a truck driver in Nelligen, who is losing income because of the fires but isn’t eligible for any assistance under the government’s recovery package. Can the prime minister tell the house why thousands of workers who lost income because of the fires can’t get a helping hand from this government? Morrison: As the member would recall, when he was in a government managing disasters, that he would know there are many other payments, whether it’s in the welfare system, whether it is in the Newstart program, or many other measures available to provide income support for those who found themselves in difficulty. That’s the whole point of the safety net that has been built. I tell you how you can keep a safety net in place. You keep it in place by ensuring you manage money well, you actually can bring a budget back into balance and do it without adding levies, as those opposite had to do when they were struck by disasters, Mr Speaker. They had to go out and tax Australians more because they couldn’t manage money. We are delivering $2 billion of additional support in initial and addition support through the national bushfire recovery agency. We’re working through the disaster recovery payment arrangements we put in place about the states and territories. We’re doing that consistent with all the same guidelines and rules put in place by the previous government, and those rules and guidelines did serve their government well, and I believe they serve our government well. Mr Speaker, I will take the interjection. Because he said I was just criticising those arrangements. I was not criticising those arrangements. His own member who asked the question previously of me was criticising the very arrangements that the government is putting in place now. Now, Mr Speaker, we will continue to work with the state and territory governments, we’ll continue to work with local councils, we’ll continue to work with businesses right across the country through local economic recovery plans now being put in place by the states with the commonwealth working with the former commissioner Colvin, who heads up the national bushfire recovery agency. What we’ll stay focused on is rebuilding this economy in those areas that have been so devastated by the bushfires, that will happen with the rebuilding work we’re putting in place. Listen carefully to those communities, whether it’s the orchardists out there in Batlow or those in the forestry industry, or the defence force we sent in who rebuilt the roof on Mogo zoo, and cleared out the Eden mill so they can get their operation back on track. That’s what we’ll continue to do each and every day. We won’t play politics with bushfires in this place. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and says something about it being an eventful month, and then seems surprised that there is laughter in response. Me too – it proves that there are still people in there listening to him. He meant trade, but because he has the self awareness of a YouTube star making an apology, he apparently doesn’t get how a week out of a ridiculous leadership spill that continues to have ramifications for the government, “bit of an eventful week” is probably the closest he has come to having a personality. Stephen Jones to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. It’s also about business, because last Friday, while on the south coast of New South Wales, I was told about businesses which did not burn down but had taken a huge hit to income because of the bushfires. Why aren’t these businesses eligible for grants, only loans, that are going to push them further into debt? Morrison: I can update the House. In New South Wales 172 applications have been made for those small business grants. 46 have been paid out, worth over $600,000. As the member may recall, because I advised of him this last week, through an answer to a question from another member, the grant applications are assessed by the New South Wales state government and managed by them. They make the payments and we reimburse those payments and that has been the arrangement under this government, under the previous government. And when it comes to the guidelines they develop for assessing whether grants are provided in circumstances like this, we have not departed from the previous practice that we inherited, which was all about damage to those businesses. That damage could include things like power being cut off, and things of that nature. What we have done is, those businesses that may have only had – I don’t mean may, because it’s significant – those businesses which had a loss of income as a result of the loss of tourist trade, what we provided to them through this category D assistance is loans, zero interest, nothing to pay for two years, and then at concessional rates, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to those businesses should they seek to take those up. They’re the same arrangements that have been put in place for previous disasters. I think it’s important, because I was in Townsville on Friday, where we had floods a year ago. And we’re still rebuilding from those floods. And I think it’s important that we provide the same assistance to those who are in north Queensland at that time, as we are today. And we’re ensuring a consistency in our approach, and that was the consistency that had been established. And I see you shake your head. If you’re saying it should be different, why didn’t the Labor party change it when you were in government, we’re using your rules. Oh golly gee, I don’t know Mr prime minister. Maybe it’s because disasters seem to have changed a bit in the past six years since the Coalition has been in power and we are seeing worse disasters more often? Maybe it’s something the actual government could look at changing? Really excited to see how hazard reduction burns will help stop floods. Right after we get onto all those arsonists who started them, and the Greens policies which didn’t let us burn the rain ahead of the monsoon season. Really loving the re-writing of the climate narrative Scott Morrison is bringing into parliament lately. It is almost as if the summer has wounded him, and he’s now attempting to pretend that there is no question in his government climate change is causing impacts. Like Jim Molan didn’t just go on national TV and question it. Like Craig Kelly didn’t straight out deny it on international TV. Like the Nationals aren’t threatening to blow up the whole show over it. But then again, “climate action now” apparently means dams and hazard reduction burns and adding exclamation marks to things, so I guess the bar is very, very low these days. Adam Bandt: Australia is in record drought, catastrophic megafires have burnt our country, our capital cities have ranked amongst the world’s most polluted and now we’re facing a flood disaster. Do you now accept we’re facing a coal-fuelled climate emergency? Morrison: As I advised the House last week, the royal commission that the government will be moving forward on, once I receive feedback from the states and the territories, on the terms of reference for that royal commission, and at that time, I will then forward a copy of that to the opposition before announcing what we intend to do with that royal commission. It starts from the premise that we’re dealing with longer, hotter, drier summers and we have always, and I have always acknowledged the link between the climate change and these broader weather climatic events. That’s not been in dispute by our government. It’s not in dispute by our government. Those on the opposite [side]... they laugh and giggle and smirk, because they’re seeking to put forward a false conflict in this place. Our government is taking action to reduce emissions and they have fallen by 12. 8%. Mr Speaker, our government has put in place policies that has led to one of the highest levels of renewable investments this country has ever seen. Now they can deny the facts if they like, but they are the facts. What I’ve also said in response to this dreadful black summer that we have been experiencing is that taking action on climate change isn’t just about taking action on emissions. It’s about taking action on climate resilience. It’s about taking action on climate adaptation. It’s about taking action on hazard reduction, which is a form of climate resilience. It’s about building dams like, Mr Speaker, the billions of dollars we’re investing in those projects through the national water grid. Building dams is climate action now. I note the leader of the Greens doesn’t agree with that. He’s entitled not to agree with that. But the science suggests it is. And our government will act on that. You may want to ... select and choose those bits you want to listen to, make climate change about being anti-capitalism, that’s not what we think. We think that capitalism and technology is the way you ensure a brighter future for this world and this country. In its first set of Senate questions, Labor targeted new Nationals deputy David Littleproud saying he doesn’t know if climate change is manmade (he has since recanted) and Liberal senator Jim Molan saying he has an open mind on the question. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, replied that the government is “committed to taking effective action on climate change”, then filibustered, leading Penny Wong and others to interject “WHAT CAUSES IT?”. Eventually, on the third question “does the Morrison government accept climate changed is human-induced?”, Cormann gives a simple answer: “Yes.” Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: Will the government agree to Labor’s proposal to extend Medicare rule incentives to bushfire-affected areas and work with states to provide counselling for kids in affected schools? Morrison: The member would be aware of the mental health package and the other support measures that have been directed to support students in schools in bushfire-affected areas. And that has been part of the response of the government through the national bushfire recovery agency. I have also had very good discussions, with the New South Wales premier in particular, about the measures they are also developing and delivering in the bushfire-affected areas, and the same has been true of the programs put in place by the Victorian government and [I am] working with the Victorian premier. … there are so many upsetting and devastating impacts of these recent fires, but the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children, those who may not have lived in the bushfire-affected areas but have travelled to those areas and have seen things they have never seen before, and the trauma it could have caused is something very much in foremost in the minds of the government and the actions of the national bushfire recovery agency. We have made commitments in that area and we’ll be assessing carefully about what else needs to be done. Keith Pitt gets his first question as a minister from Terri Butler: Does the minister support the development of a domestic nuclear power industry fuelled by Australian resources and cooled by our scarce water reserves? Pitt starts by attempting to be clever, having prepared for this very question (Labor’s first press release on Pitt’s ascension was on this very topic and there have been many, many tweets) but the question is worded simply enough that he gets a “back on the topic please” ruling from the Speaker. As the honourable member knows, there’s already a nuclear industry in Australia, it’s at Lucas Heights. We have a nuclear reactor in Australia producing very important medical technology for all Australians. Those opposite should do their research. I was a supplementary member [of the committee]. I couldn’t even vote on the report ... Cue Speaker warning. Pitt: Noted, Mr Speaker. Tony Smith: That’s a ruling. You can note it, and act on it is the most important thing. Pitt: As I will. The opposition knows the government’s position. There’s a moratorium on nuclear energy in this country. I was a member of the backbench committee that made recommendations. The government will respond to the recommendations in due course. In a dixer, Scott Morrison seems to say that the government can’t guarantee it will be organising any more flights out of coronavirus impacted areas: There can be no guarantee the Australian government are in a position to operate further flights into these affected areas. We said we would prioritise isolated and vulnerable Australians and that’s what we’ve done and we thank the Chinese government for their co-operation in assisting us to be able to assist the departure of those Australians from those areas. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I ask, how can the prime minister claim to lead a stable government when, on the day set aside to pay respect to victims of the bushfires, the Nationals decided to have a leadership challenge, and today a National party member quit, threatening the government’s control of the House. When Australia needs stable government, why do we have a coalition of chaos? Morrison: The leader of the opposition does not represent the situation in the government at all. Not at all. Mr Speaker, our government ... Here are all of our members, and the member for Wide Bay is up the top there, he’s doing a great job. As all the members are representing all of their constituents, and I tell you what they’re doing, they’re doing what they promised the Australian people they would do, Mr Speaker. They said, when they went to their electorates, they were part of a government that was going to keep the economy strong, keep Australians safe, and keep Australians together, Mr Speaker. And what we’ve done since that election, we’ve been delivering on the commitments we took to the Australian people. Delivering tax cuts, Mr Speaker, getting on with the job of delivering our climate solutions fund, getting on with the job of keeping Australians safe, and in the face of some of the biggest disasters we’ve seen, Mr Speaker, ensuring that the response, the establishment of the national bushfire recovery agency, the stand-up of the first compulsory call-out of the reserves in response to a bushfire crisis, Mr Speaker, the implementation of our packages to support drought-affected farmers, the stand-up of our arrangements in terms of counter-terrorism, and ensuring that we’re doing the right thing in terms of foreign interference and the impact, Mr Speaker, of foreign terrorist fighters. Our government is keeping Australians safe and we’re respecting our veterans with the measures we announced last week, and we’re getting on with the job what if we promised the Australian people. $100 million in additional infrastructure investments, not only building the roads, but the rail connections this country needs, both now and into the future. We’re delivering on what we told the Australian people we would do. What do we have from those opposite? Each way. They’re for tax cuts, they’re against tax cuts, they are for the drought fund, they’re against the drought fund. The bells are ringing for the resumption of parliament. [cont from previous post] Veronica Koman, an Indonesian human rights lawyer and advocate for West Papua, currently living in exile in Australia, said it was incumbent on Australia, as a neighbour and friend of Indonesia, to raise the issue of West Papua with the visiting president. She said 56 indigenous West Papuans and one Indonesian advocate were currently in prisons across Indonesia charged with treason and facing the potential of life imprisonment for protesting against Indonesian rule over Papua. “These people were arrested when expressing their opinion during mass protests against racism and for an independence referendum in August and September 2019 and during commemoration of West Papua’s national day on 1 December,” Koman said. “We demand their immediate and unconditional release.” As many as 45,000 people are displaced from the Nduga regency of Papua following a joint military and police operation there, Koman said. Father Santon Tekege, a priest in the diocese of Timika in West Papua, said the massive and continued military build-up across Nduga and other parts of Papua was “adding to the trauma of fear and anxiety” for West Papuans. “Many indigenous Papuans are starving, many people are displaced in the forests, other community members have been raped or shot dead,” he told the Guardian. The Indonesian government position on West Papua has been resolute for decades. It regards the province as an indivisible part of a unitary Indonesia state, and has consistently rebuffed demands from West Papuans for independence. The Australian government supports Jakarta’s position. Widodo did not mention West Papua in his speech to the Australian parliament. However, a joint statement issued by Widodo and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, “reaffirmed [the leaders’] commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which outlines Indonesia and Australia’s respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has been urged to uphold a two-year-old promise to allow United Nations human rights officials free and unfettered access to the restive province of West Papua. Greens leader Adam Bandt met with Widodo following his address to the House of Representatives Monday and told him: “Thank you for your speech, thanks for your comments on climate change, now please get something done on West Papua”. Resource-rich but under-developed West Papua has been engaged in a campaign for independence from Indonesia since 1961. The issue flared to acute violence again last year, with mass protests – and widespread arrests – across the remote province, sparked by racist abuse of indigenous Papuan students in other parts of Indonesia. A letter from Bandt, and Victorian senator Richard di Natale, presented to the Indonesian president, welcomed his commitment in February 2018 to allow UN human rights officials “immediate and unfettered access to Papua”. “We call on you to implement that commitment … we also welcome your previous statements indicating that you would lift restrictions on access for foreign journalists and human rights monitors, and ask that you expedite this promise. “We further urge you to order an independent and impartial investigation into all human rights violations related to last year’s protests in Papua, with the aim of bringing the perpetrators of such abuse to justice.” Every time someone says “XX is tearing the Nats apart” I just picture Tommy Wiseau screaming in The Room, and I have to say it makes a lot of things better. Joko Widodo also compared Australia and Indonesia to the good guys in the Marvel universe, using a movie where the main character dies (for the common good) and the good guys only win because they manage to go back in time. The collaboration of the Indonesian-Australia partnership, in the midst of the rising global uncertainties, can be illustrated by the movie ‘Avengers: Endgame’. When the forces of good unite, the Avengers assemble and the common enemy can be defeated. When Indonesia and Australia continue to collaborate and work together, then intolerance and protectionism and the fear of poverty and the threat of climate change can be overcome. Sarah Martin has heard from Llew O’Brien’s office – the man of the hour will make a statement after 7pm, when he has spoken to the prime minister. Just stepping outside of parliament for the moment. There are evacuation orders for some Sydney areas … Just wondering if anyone has asked Peter Dutton yet whether arsonists also lit the floods? Question time won’t be until after 2.30pm. The rest of the parliament has gone quiet while the Joko Widodo formalities play out, so now is a great time to get some lunch, or a mimosa or something. Malcolm Turnbull was stopped in the marble foyer ahead of the reception for Joko Widodo, and was asked about the *latest* energy war in his former party room. The cheapest form of new generation is a combination of renewables plus storage. And there is – literally, that is no longer a remotely contentious proposition. And these people who are advocating that the government should fund coal-fired power are basically making a case for higher emissions and higher energy prices. And that is nuts. The 15th address from a foreign leader to the parliament (with senators as guests). So nice to see we have moved on from all of this (that was obviously extreme sarcasm). Really enjoying Liberal National party MPs saying they want to see Llew O’Brien “stay in the team”. HE HAS NOT LEFT THE TEAM. He is still an LNP MP. He remains a Morrison government backbencher. He is just not going to sit in the Nationals party room. THAT IS IT. Remember when the leadership spill which ended Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership was supposed to end all the energy fights in the Coalition? The hands have been shaken and the talks had – Joko Widodo has left the chamber. This is interesting. Joko Widodo: I would like to propose a number of priority agendas as we head into the century of partnership. First, we must continue to advocate the values of democracy and human rights. Stop intolerance, stop xenophobia, stop radicalism and stop terrorism. Identity politics is a trap to democracy. A threat to diversity and a threat to tolerance. These threats will become more actual exploitation for short-term political interests, resulting in hatred, fear and even social conflict. As democratic and diverse countries, we must work hard, side by side together, to defend the values of democracy, tolerance and diversity and to look at the clash of civilisation. Second, Indonesia and Australia must enforce open, free and fair economic principles. Whilst protectionism is rising, we must continue to advocate economic openness and fairness. And the growing popularity of the approach we need to bolster, win-win. I very much believe an open and fair economic system will be beneficial for all. Joko Widodo is pretty strong when it comes to explaining Australia’s relationship with Indonesia: The people of Indonesia will always remember, will always remember, when Indonesia was struck by a tsunami in 2004 in Aceh. Australian soldiers sadly perished while assisting friends in Aceh. They are friends of Indonesia and they are heroes of humanity. The Indonesian president is only the 15th world leader to be given this honour. He opens with a G’day mate, which gets a laugh. The representatives of Australia, the platoon of the Indonesian army engineers, along with personnel of the Indonesian national body for emergency management, have departed Indonesia to New South Wales. They only have one purpose – to work hand in hand with the Australian people to overcome the bushfire crisis in Australia. And at the same time, teams from Indonesia and Australia are currently discussing possible cooperation for weather modification. On 23 December 2019, I have reaffirmed to Prime Minister Morrison a clear message that Indonesia will always be with Australia during this difficult time. Following the untimely passing of Prime Minister Morrison’s father, [I] had a briefing with the prime minister and his family. True friends are people who stay with you during the good and bad times. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Having a look at the chamber, Adam Bandt has one of the rock star seats behind the main table, right smack bang in front of the lectern where Joko Widodo is making his address. The seat next to him is empty. That seemed a little strange, so we have made some calls. Under the protocol, the seat Bandt is sitting in is reserved for the Greens leader in the Senate, which would be Larissa Waters. So it looks like, as party leader, Bandt has taken that seat. OK The empty chair though, next to his, is reserved for the Nationals leader in the Senate. Which would be Bridget McKenzie. McKenzie is in the chamber – she is sitting in the benches. I’ll leave it to you to decide why she has not taken her designated seat of honour. I’ve just been reminded of why the parliament doesn’t do these addresses as a joint sitting of the parliament anymore – it’s because of Bob Brown. In 2003, the then Greens senator interrupted then US president George W Bush as he spoke to the parliament, embarrassing then prime minister John Howard. Greens senator Kerry Nettle was also ejected from the chamber for interrupting. It not only made international news, it also changed parliamentary practices. The House Procedure Committee recommended any future addresses should be carried out as House sittings, with senators invited as guests (which limits their ability to speak, because it makes it easier to boot them out). The practice was adopted and now, senators can as guests, but joint sittings are out. So quite a bit to unpack there. Basically – trade and investment will grow. The countries are in lockstep on regional security and the South China Sea. There will be more discussions on visa changes between the two countries. And Australia wants to grow the relationship. The statement continues: Contributing to Indo-Pacific Stability and Prosperity 36. With a view to strengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean, leaders welcomed the elevation of the Indonesia-Australia-India Strategic Dialogue to foreign ministers’ level, with the first meeting to be held as soon as practicable, and looked forward to working closely with India in strengthening the resilience of the Indian Ocean countries, including through the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). 37. Leaders also agreed on the importance of working together in the South Pacific. They welcomed the first iteration of the Indonesia-South Pacific Forum held in March 2019 as well as the Pacific Exposition held in Auckland in July 2019; and looked forward to trilateral development cooperation with Pacific neighbours in areas of mutual interest to support the development and economic prosperity of the region. 38. Leaders agreed on the need to deepen our collaboration in support of Asean-led regional architecture. Australia commended Indonesia’s leadership of the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and welcomed Indonesia’s plans to host the World Economic Forum on Asean and the Indo-Pacific 2020 in July, in which Australia looks forward to participating. 39. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment for Australia and Indonesia to work collaboratively toward the establishment of a co-deployment to a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation as a new chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. They highlighted that the co-deployment would elevate our contribution to the implementation of the United Nations’ Action for Peacekeeping initiative and our already strong and mature defence cooperation, as it would be the first time Australia and Indonesia deploy together. 40. Leaders also emphasised their commitment to continue to work together at the UN to support the international rules-based order, acknowledging Indonesia’s term on the UN Security Council (2019-20) and both countries’ current membership of the UN Human Rights Council (Australia 2018-20; Indonesia 2020-22). 41. Leaders welcomed continued cooperation between Indonesia and Australia in the G20, including in advocating for action to give effect to the G20 commitment to end IUU fishing and in supporting the G20 initiative on preventing terrorist exploitation of the internet. 42. Leaders affirmed the continued importance of Apec in promoting sustainable development and free, and open trade. Leaders will advocate for an ambitious Apec post-2020 vision to follow the 1994 Bogor Goals under Malaysia’s Apec chairmanship in 2020. 43. Leaders recognised the importance of collaboration and cooperation in managing and responding to disaster risks and humanitarian crises in the Indo-Pacific region and will bolster these efforts through a new Indonesia-Australia Partnership in Disaster Risk Management, including to build capacity in disaster risk management at the sub-national level in Indonesia. 44. Building on decades of collaboration in the health sector, leaders agreed to explore new opportunities for bilateral and regional cooperation, including through a new Indonesia-Australia Health Security Partnership, which will operate in collaboration with Australia’s Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security to help prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks in our region. 45. President Widodo expressed his sincere gratitude to the Australian Government for the warm welcome and the hospitalities accorded to him and the Indonesian delegation during the state visit, which reflects the bonds of long-standing friendship and solid foundation for the advancement of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The statement continues: Maritime Cooperation 27. Leaders recognised the importance of maritime trade and the blue economy to Australia and Indonesia’s collective prosperity. They committed to developing maritime connectivity between markets in the region. 28. Leaders expressed serious concerns about developments in the South China Sea, including the continued militarisation of disputed features, and reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace, security, stability, and freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. They called for disputes to be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982. 29. Leaders noted negotiations between Asean and China towards a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and underlined the importance of any Code of Conduct: being consistent with international law, particularly UNCLOS; not prejudicing the interests and rights of third parties or other states; and supporting existing, inclusive regional architecture. 30. Leaders committed to deepen practical cooperation on maritime issues to support common interests in the maritime domain, including in the areas of improving maritime domain awareness, supporting understanding of and adherence to UNCLOS, combatting illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing and other activities under the Joint Declaration on Maritime Cooperation’s Plan of Action. Indonesia welcomes Australia’s interest in a partnership to develop maritime and fishing capacities in Indonesia’s outermost islands. 31. Leaders reaffirmed both countries’ active interest in ocean sustainability. Indonesia and Australia co-led the establishment of the Regional Plan of Action to Promote Responsible Fishing Practices including Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in the Region (RPOA-IUU) and will continue to advance regional fisheries objectives through this important instrument. 32. Leaders welcomed the announcement of a cooperation arrangement with JCLEC that formalises the Maritime Training Faculty and will see an Australian Border Force official posted to JCLEC. 33. Leaders welcomed the cooperation between the Indonesian Directorate General of Sea Transportation (DGST) and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) that will result in the establishment of two significant maritime safety training facilities. 34. Leaders also welcomed the extension of the Arrangement between the Maritime Security Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (Bakamla) and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as represented by the Australian Border Force (ABF) on Maritime Security Cooperation a further three years, the prospect of an Australian port visit by Bakamla, and acknowledged the tenth anniversary of desktop training cooperation between Bakamla and the ABF. 35. In acknowledgement of the serious and growing challenge of marine plastic waste, Leaders agreed to establish an Indonesia-Australia Systemic Innovation Lab on Marine Plastic Waste under the leadership of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Agency for Marine and Fishery Research and Human Resources of the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fishery. This new initiative will strengthen our research collaboration to help identify new approaches in tackling marine plastic waste across our region. The joint statement continues: Securing Our and the Region’s Shared Interests 17. Leaders acknowledged the closeness of the two countries’ wide-ranging bilateral cooperation on justice, law and security. They welcomed the achievements of the Australia Indonesia Partnership for Justice II, aimed at supporting Indonesia’s law and justice institutions and civil society, and strengthening our overall security architecture. 18. Leaders acknowledged the need for an increased focus on countering violent extremism, and committed to work together to prevent radicalisation, challenge extremist propaganda, and maintain strong, cohesive, and multicultural and multi-faith societies. 19. Leaders highlighted the importance of bilateral strategic dialogue, including through the annual 2+2 meetings between foreign and defence ministers, held most recently in Bali in December 2019. 20. Leaders welcomed the ongoing Indonesia-Australia Ministerial Council on Law and Security, and the Indonesia-Australia Counter Terrorism Consultation as important forums for strengthening cooperation on the evolving threats of terrorism, transnational crime and cyber security. 21. Leaders highlighted the ongoing success of the sub-regional meeting established in 2017 and co-chaired by Indonesia and Australia as a regional mechanism to collectively respond to transnational security threats, particularly terrorism and foreign terrorist fighters. 22. Leaders emphasised the importance of an open, free and secure Internet to economic growth and innovation. Leaders welcomed the concrete program of bilateral activities underway, particularly cyber bootcamps for Indonesian officials, and regular training on cyber security, cyber policy and international law and norms. Leaders resolved to further deepen cooperation in areas of mutual interest and welcomed further initiatives supported by the Cyber Cooperation Program to strengthen cyber security skills, institutions and digital skills development through short-term fellowship opportunities. Leaders looked forward to the next Indonesia-Australia cyber policy dialogue taking place in 2020. 23. In the context of co-chairing the Bali Process, leaders acknowledged the two countries’ constructive bilateral cooperation to counter people smuggling and trafficking in persons in collaboration with regional partners. Leaders looked forward to the next Bali Process Ministerial Conference taking place in late 2020. Leaders welcomed progress on the Bali Process Government and Business Forum to engage the private sector in addressing trafficking in persons and related exploitation. 24. Leaders emphasised the importance of protecting the victims and witnesses of serious transnational crimes such as trafficking in persons and terrorism. Indonesia and Australia have committed to work together to strengthen domestic and regional capacity to effectively assist victims and witnesses. 25. Leaders acknowledged that the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) will continue to be a centre of excellence for capacity building on law enforcement in combating transnational, serious and organised crime. 26. Leaders witnessed the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding on Transportation Security Cooperation, recognising the importance of the transport sector to the economic and social development of both countries. The joint statement continues: Connecting People 13. Leaders expressed their sincere sympathies to those affected by the bushfires in Australia, and the recent flooding in Jakarta. Australia welcomed the deployment of Indonesian military engineers to assist in the response to the bushfires. Leaders reflected on our countries’ long and proud history of supporting each other in times of need – from TNI’s assistance to Australia following Cyclone Tracy in 1974 to the ADF’s assistance following the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018. 14. Leaders recognised that shared links in areas such as education and research collaboration help to create greater understanding between our communities and act as a springboard for an even broader partnership between our two countries. Leaders welcomed the continuation of programs such as Building Relationships through Intercultural Dialogue and Growing Engagement (BRIDGE), the New Colombo Plan, the Destination Australia Program, the Darmasiswa Scholarship, and the Indonesia Arts and Culture Scholarship, which enhance interactions among students and teachers from both countries. 15. Leaders welcomed the announcement that Monash University will open a campus in Indonesia – the first foreign university campus in Indonesia – which will greatly strengthen educational collaboration between the two countries. 16. Leaders welcomed the holding of the first Interfaith Dialogue in Bandung in March 2019, and committed to another Interfaith Dialogue in 2021. It continues: Enhanced Economic and Development Partnership 5. Leaders welcomed the imminent completion of their respective domestic processes for the ratification of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA‑CEPA). 6. Australia and Indonesia committed to deepening our economic, trade and investment relationship, including taking forward initiatives this year to harvest early benefits from IA‑CEPA ratification. This will include full implementation of IA-CEPA and early work on an IA‑CEPA Economic Cooperation Program; an Australian Business Week delegation led by the Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and a further visit by major Australian private sector investors; the establishment of a CEO Roundtable; the development of a Blueprint for Trade and Investment in Indonesia and assistance to Indonesian SME exporters. 7. A bilateral economic, trade and investment ministers’ meeting will be inaugurated, to drive this deepening of cooperation on bilateral and global economic issues. A senior economic officials’ meeting will also be established. 8. Leaders noted opportunities for increasing people-to-people links, including through IA‑CEPA’s skills package, and that Indonesian access to Australia’s work and holiday visa will increase from 1,000 to 4,100 upon IA-CEPA’s entry into force, and increase further to 5,000 in the sixth year of the agreement. 9. Leaders reaffirmed the benefits of open markets and inclusive regional economic integration. Leaders committed to working constructively together through the G20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and other regional and multilateral fora to support the multilateral trading system and take forward WTO reform. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and will work together to finalise all outstanding negotiations ahead of signature in 2020, completing an agreement which builds on the Asean-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) and which complements IA-CEPA. 10. Through our longstanding economic partnership for development, leaders agreed to cooperate to encourage sustainable and inclusive economic growth and stability; address poverty and inequality; strengthen human capital, education and skills; promote women’s leadership and empowerment; and support disability inclusion. 11. Given how close eastern Indonesia and northern Australia are, leaders agreed to explore ways to further boost economic cooperation and connectivity, including through better transportation links. 12. Leaders highlighted opportunities for collaboration on the relocation of Indonesia’s capital city, a national development priority for Indonesia. Scott Morrison and Joko Widodo have released their joint statement, which outlines what has been agreed upon in their bilateral talks so far: 1. During President Joko Widodo’s state visit to Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and President Widodo met for the Indonesia-Australia annual leaders’ meeting and held a joint ministerial meeting with other Australian and Indonesian ministers in Canberra on 10 February 2020. 2. Leaders acknowledged the recent 70th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between Australia and Indonesia, and agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation under the five pillars of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in 2018. 3. Leaders witnessed the signing of the Plan of Action for the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership by foreign ministers, which outlines the practical cooperation between the two countries for 2020-2024. 4. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which outlines Indonesia and Australia’s respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as being the bedrock of our defence and security relationship. The last time a leader from another nation addressed the Australian parliament, was in October 2016, when Singapore prime minister Lee Hsein Loong gave a speech. Joko Widodo has been announced and he has taken his seat of honour, ready to make his address. While we wait for the address to begin, Murph has taken a look at just how Scott Morrison uses the lack of trust in the political system to his advantage in the latest Full Story podcast. Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull are in the gallery for Jokowi’s address. Turnbull and Widodo were quite close as leaders – you may remember that Turnbull was sent to Indonesia by Scott Morrison to smooth things over after Morrison floated the idea of moving the Israeli embassy during the Wentworth byelection. Joko Widodo’s address to parliament is about to begin. The House is filling up. Senators have been invited as guests. Question time will be pushed back until about 2.30 to accommodate the change in schedule. The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, has lodged some regulations revealing details about the census, including that it will be held on 10 August, 2021 and there will be two new questions on defence force service and health conditions diagnosed by a doctor or nurse. This appears to end a scuffle in the government over whether to include two new questions on gender and sexuality. Last week Guardian Australia reported that health minister Greg Hunt had lobbied Sukkar to include the questions because they would”greatly inform the government’s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census”. The Australian Bureau of Statistics had noted that two federal departments need the data to deliver services and it would have “strong value across all levels of government” but recommended sexual orientation not be added to the census due to possible backlash. A spokesman for Sukkar told Guardian Australia: “The government has accepted the recommendations of the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding topics that should be included in the 2021 Census, which ensures the information collected reflects Australia’s priority information needs.” Back to the Joko Widodo visit: Jokowi also addressed the media, saying the visit marked a “new beginning” for the two countries following the signing of the Indonesia-Australia comprehensive economic partnership agreement – the official name for the free trade agreement signed between the two countries. “This means going forward, the economic relationship between the two countries will grow and bring more tangible benefits to the people,” he said. He added that the two leaders had discussed opportunities for Australia in the areas of infrastructure and education investment in Indonesia, as well as strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. He spoke about the hope for “peace and stability” in the region, with the pair discussing the security situation in the South China Sea and climate change action, with particular reference to Pacific island nations. Despite Indonesia being one of the most important democracies in the region, the media statement from Jokowi did not allow for journalists to ask any questions. So, just to recap – Llew O’Brien has quit the National party but not the LNP. In Queensland, the Liberal-National coalition is formalised as one party. So NOTHING HAS CHANGED. He will sit with the Coalition in the chamber, he will sit in the joint Coalition party room and he will vote with the government, because he is still a member of the government. He just won’t be going to National party room meetings anymore. Which sounds like a win-win. Much like when my maths teacher would make me sit outside the classroom for being “easily distracted and a distraction to others”. Barnaby Joyce released his text message to Scott Morrison to Sky News this morning, explaining just why he is throwing a tantrum over Michael McCormack’s cabinet picks: “Sorry Scott but Michael picking only those who voted for him is foolish as it leaves little room for ownership to the team and as such makes things precarious”. It’s worth noting that the last time there was a leadership tantrum in the Nationals, McCormack did include Joyce backers in the cabinet. And this text message seems fine to release, but Joyce apparently can’t release his ‘text message’ reports he made to Morrison as the drought envoy. Those relating to government to policy need to stay secret, but texts about internal party waa-waa-crying-face sulks are apparently in the public interest. Anthony Albanese’s son Nathan is in parliament today – he will be the opposition leader’s guest at Joko Widodo’s address Scott Morrison was a little more expansive on what the chat between himself and Joko Widodo was about: We have also agreed to establish an energy dialogue between Australia and Indonesia. We have much to share, both in understanding of the challenges and as Indonesia is going through an accelerated development path, [about] how we can ensure that the fuel sources for the future are very much part of Indonesia’s development and Australia’s. We will be working together on science, research, technology and sharing our view of the future energy sources for both of our countries, and we look forward to that partnership for energy in Australia and Indonesia, but also how that might broadly lead our region. Monash University will establish its first foreign campus in Indonesia under this agreement, and that is an indication of how this is a two-way street. Not only that, but the treasurer today reinforced the opportunity for Australian pension funds, superannuation funds, to be looking at the opportunities that exist in Indonesia, as they do in many other countries around the world, and we see that investment partnership is a key part of how the agreement will be realised. On the issues of strategic security in our region, Indonesia is a leader and wonderful partner to Australia, whether it is on maritime cooperation or working together with international peacekeeping, which we will now be seeking to do. This is just a further layer in what is already a very, very deep relationship, and when it comes to the South China Sea, we share our commitment to sovereignty, stability and respect for the rule of international law. We have also discussed today ... challenges around counterterrorism, countering foreign fighters and influence. These are issues in which we are sharing expertise under view of the world. Finally, we have the opportunity to talk through issues of the coronavirus and the measures we are taking in concert and the information we are sharing to contain the impact of the coronavirus in Indonesia and Australia, and we will continue to work closely with our medical advisors and the other arrangements we have to ensure we can both effectively carry out our responsibilities to our peoples to keep the health and well-being of our peoples in the highest possible order. As you can see, it’s been a very wide-ranging discussion. Zali Steggall and her crossbench colleagues have just held a press conference marking the introduction of her climate bill. Steggall is trying to nudge Liberals inclined to talk about the importance of climate action to do something about it. She wants a conscience vote, and she wants MPs to consider how they might “deliver safety and certainty for their electorates”. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie says a conscience vote creates an opportunity “for modern Liberals to stand and take some action”. The Victorian independent Helen Haines says this bill represents an opportunity for parliamentarians to restore trust in politics, by projecting a capacity to work together. Steggall has not yet discussed the bill with Scott Morrison. It’s not clear whether there will be support to bring it on in the parliament. Steggall makes it clear she wants to build support in the community to pressure MPs to move the bill forward. She’s set up a website to accompany the bill and says if MPs decline the opportunity to be constructive “their electorates will be made very aware of their position”. The bill includes a commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, specifies the need to have an adaptation plan, and establishes an independent climate commission. Scott Morrison is welcoming Joko Widodo to Canberra, in one of the committee rooms. Widodo will address the House later this morning. The bilateral talks are all about trade and security (when are they not?) but there is a bit of climate and energy thrown in for good measure. Morrison: We have discussed many issues as part of our growing partnership, our growing agenda, between our two nations. The 100 day action plan for the implementation of the agreement will see it, as it comes into effect, ramped up and the momentum established at all levels. [It will be] a mutually beneficial arrangement, one that sees the cooperation of our economies for the strong growth that it will see over the next decade and beyond. Indonesia will be one of the star economies of the world over the next 10 to 20 years and this arrangement, this mutually beneficial arrangement, will ensure that our economy is linked for this exciting period of growth in the years ahead. Today we have agreed to include new elements as part of this implementation. We are pleased that our home affairs minister here in Australia will be engaging with his Indonesian counterpart to proceed to look at how we can simplify and streamline the issues of entry into Australia. We also agree to reconsider and look at the issues of travel advice in Indonesia, particularly for those areas most frequented by Australian visitors. Indonesia is a very large country with a very large population, and we need to ensure that we have this flexibility that respects and understands that, and we thank the president and his ministers for raising these issues with us. We have also agreed to establish an energy dialogue between Australia and Indonesia. Really, really looking forward to Pauline Hanson defining “traditional sex” in the Senate when she enters her latest WTAF piece of legislation: From the “why is this happening” file – The Prohibiting the Indoctrination of Children bill would counteract a wide range of issues described as indoctrination of young children: including skewed versions of history taught as fact, controversial sexual programs that teach gender fluidity and realignment to infants, unsubstantiated human-induced climate change, as well as the teachings of so-called “safe” underage sex, sexting, and non-traditional sex. The bill recognises parents across Australia who have concerns about biased teachings, they don’t like the teaching of non-traditional and controversial views that don’t give the full picture; they want to protect and strengthen their children, and this bill does that. Parents want a sensible curriculum that sets their children up for meaningful, employable futures, without the distraction of false or imbalanced ideology. Under his eye, yadda, yadda, yadda. Matt Canavan has written an article for the Courier Mail, where he came up with this line: Renewable energy can complement our energy needs but renewables do not run all the time making them unsuitable to support manufacturing jobs. Renewables are the dole bludgers of the energy system, they only turn up to work when they want to. First of all – sigh. Secondly, I guess that makes coal the franking credit recipients of the energy system – holding on, despite the death throes and the impacts to the rest of society. Good times: That “inner city Liberal” Christensen is talking about, is Trent Zimmerman, who made comments on Sky this morning that he didn’t believe investing in coal was a role for the government – that the market could decide. That’s Labor’s position as well – even Joel Fitzgibbon manages to hold on to that one. The bells are ringing –parliament is about to begin The government has said it will be releasing its 2050 emissions strategy ahead of the climate meeting in Glasgow (which they have to, in order to be able to trade with the EU, as the French foreign minister has already told us). But the government is also still trying to calm down its party room, which has a section completely obsessed with coal. It’s funding a $4m feasibility study into a north Queensland coal power station, because it’s trying to kick that fight down the road. Mathias Cormann had a chat about that to the ABC this morning: We always said that we would support a feasibility study like the one that’s been announced, and you know, obviously coal will continue to be an important part of our energy mix in the foreseeable future, and a high efficiency, low emissions coal-fired power station, obviously, can be an important part of helping us meet our emissions reduction targets. But ultimately, a project like that will have to stack up commercially. It will have to stack up on its own right. And that is obviously a matter for after the feasibility study. I mean, the whole range of industries, exporting industries, manufacturing exporting industries in Australia, do need access to reliable, affordable power, and obviously we want to ensure that that power is environmentally as efficient as possible. And in that context, this feasibility study, hopefully, will be able to demonstrate that this project can stack up based on private sector investment. Australia produces about 6% of global coal, it has responsibility for about 6% of global coal production. I think you’ll find that Australia will continue to be a significant producer, exporter and consumer of it. And of course, Australian coal is environmentally much more efficient than the coal alternatives from other parts of the world. I mean, our coal, our black coal, is ... it obviously has lower moisture content, lower ash content, higher energy intensity. And it is, obviously, in the interests of the environment for more Australian coal to be used and for it to displace coal from other sources, which is more polluting. Oxfam has welcomed Zali Steggall and the crossbench climate bill. From the group’s climate change advisor Simon Bradshaw: This bill represents the minimum action necessary to bring Australia into line with comparable countries and to get us on the path to zero emissions as soon as possible. It is an important and practical step that deserves support from all sides of politics. As parliament resumes after a horrendous summer of extreme weather and bushfires, we welcome this move by Ms Steggall, which is a response to community sentiment to ‘just get on with it’ when it comes to setting the framework required to address the climate crisis. Importantly, by beginning a sequence of five-year emissions budgets, guided by independent advice, the bill requires a strengthening of Australia’s existing and woefully inadequate 2030 emissions reduction targets. We recognise that this proposed law alone will not be enough to ensure Australia plays its part in limiting warming to 1.5°C and avoiding a future of ever more devastating climate disruption, and that it will need to be accompanied by determined efforts to shift Australia rapidly beyond coal and gas and to 100% clean exports by 2030. Nonetheless, it is an important foundation. The climate crisis affects every one of us. Globally, it is the single greatest threat in the fight against hunger and poverty. Here in Australia, it is already taking an enormous toll on the lives and livelihoods of many Australians. If Australia can break free from decades of policy paralysis and partisan battles over climate action, we can not only help ensure a safer future for Australians and people everywhere, but equally realise Australia’s huge potential to prosper in a zero-carbon world. It’s time for our leaders to act. Zali Steggall has released the Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) bill 2020. The crossbench are hoping to get a conscience vote on this. But for those wondering what it’s all about, here is the introduction to the bill. This act establishes a framework for adaptation and mitigation in relation to climate change. Decision-makers must consider seven guiding principles when performing functions or duties or exercising powers under this act or provisions of other prescribed acts. The commission is required to prepare a national climate change risk assessment within a year of the commencement of this act and every five years after that. In response to each national climate change risk assessment, the minister must prepare a national adaptation plan. The commission must evaluate the implementation of these plans annually. This act sets a target of zero net accounting emissions by 2050. The target can only be changed if there is a significant change in circumstances and the commission is satisfied the significant change justifies the change. In order to meet the net zero target, the act also provides for the minister to set emissions budgets for emissions budget periods on advice from the commission. The minister must also prepare emissions reduction plans for each emissions budget. The commission provides advice on these plans also. This act establishes the commission and provides for a Parliamentary Joint Committee on climate Adaptation and Mitigation. Appointments to the commission must be approved by the committee. Just a reminder – this is not a very sad situation. Literally nothing changes. Nothing. If Llew O’Brien is still a member of the LNP, he is still a member of the government. He is just not sitting in the Nationals party room, and is freed to slam Michael McCormack’s leadership even more. And for the pedants out there, a clarification: Joko Widodo will not be addressing a joint sitting of the parliament – just the House. But senators are invited to watch as guests. Over in the Senate, and Labor wants to try and address some issues with the encryption laws – the ones Labor had passed, in the hopes that it could fix the legislation if it won the election. We all know how that played out. Today, Labor will try and have the recommendations the intelligence and security committee put forward, which the government did not implement. From Kristina Keneally: Today in the Senate, Labor will debate a private senator’s bill – Telecommunications Amendment (Repairing Assistance and Access) bill 2019. The bill implements the bipartisan recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. The amendments in Labor’s bill were agreed to by Liberal PJCIS members and promised by the government some 14 months ago. The Australian tech sector holds great potential for economic growth and job creation, but is being held back by the Morrison government’s failure to deliver these legislative changes. Tech companies report that customers are less likely to seek out contracts with Australian companies because the encryption laws pose risks that they would be required by the government to introduce systemic weaknesses into their products and systems. ... Labor’s plans to improve the flawed encryption legislation have been supported by the Communications Alliance, StartupAus, the Australian Industry Group, BSA The Software Alliance, the Human Rights Law Centre, Digital Rights Watch, Electronic Frontiers Australia and the Australian Privacy Foundation. In bipartisanship news, Dave Sharma and Josh Burns will introduce a private members motion together, calling on Israel to extradite Malka Leifer. Leifer is wanted on 74 charges related to child sexual abuse dating back to when she was principal of the Adass Isreal school in Melbourne. Australia first requested Leifer be extradited in 2014. From the joint release: There have been 63 court hearings since that time, and the case still has not moved to the formal extradition phase, despite a psychiatric panel declaring Malka Leifer fit for extradition in January this year. Leifer’s alleged victims, sisters Dassi Erlich, Nicole Meyer and Elly Sapper, have waited long enough for their former principal to face justice in Australia. Indonesian president Joko Widodo is (literally) in the House. He’ll sign the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) with Scott Morrison and address the parliament later this morning. Amnesty International has called on Morrison to raise the West Papuan situation with Widodo and Greens leader Adam Bandt and former leader Richard Di Natale will be wearing West Papuan lapel flags during the address. West Papuan human rights advocate Ronny Kareni will also be Di Natale’s guest. Kareni “is a member of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua and is a longstanding campaigner for West Papuan human rights”. OK. Back on deck now (the rain, welcome as it is, led to a few logistical problems for me this morning, so apologies). What does the Llew O’Brien drama mean? Nothing really. He remains in the LNP, and he’ll sit in the joint party room. He just won’t sit in the Nationals party room. He is a pretty conservative guy, so there is no way on Lizzo’s green earth he won’t vote with the government 99% of the time. The government’s two-seat majority is not in doubt. He’ll just be free(er – he has never been a quiet one) to make a bit more noise. A bit like Kevin Hogan after Malcolm Turnbull was rolled. Hogan stayed in the Nationals but sat on the crossbench in the chamber. O’Brien remains in the LNP, so he is still a member of the government, but won’t sit in the Nationals party room. It’s the clayton’s crossbench. Here is AAP on Llew O’Brien: Nationals backbencher Llew O’Brien has quit the party following Barnaby Joyce’s failed leadership bid. O’Brien told Scott Morrison of his decision on Sunday night. He will remain in the Coalition party room. “O’Brien joined the LNP at its inception and remains a member of the LNP. O’Brien will not make any statements until after he has met with the prime minister,” his spokeswoman told AAP on Monday. The member for Wide Bay in Queensland was among Barnaby Joyce supporters who were last week threatening to cross the floor and block Coalition legislation after the failed leadership bid. Senior government minister Mathias Cormann said O’Brien would still be a member of the Liberal National party. “He continues to support the government – that is what he has made clear to the prime minister,” Cormann said. O’Brien will give the government supply. The Nationals just keep on keeping on, don’t they? The Courier Mail reports Wide Bay (one of the safest Liberal National party seats in Queensland) MP Llew O’Brien quit the National party last night, after a “shouting match” with Michael McCormack. You can read the whole story here in the Courier Mail. O’Brien is the MP who brought on the leadership spill last week. Seems he is still not over it. His local paper reports he told Scott Morrison last night he was going to quit the National party – but Morrison has granted him permission to stay in the LNP. What that means I am not quite sure, but at this stage, O’Brien won’t be sitting in the National party room or the Liberal party room. And he’ll still give the government supply. But he will be free to cross the floor on a whole heap of other issues, like ensuring integrity. Meanwhile, it seems George Christensen is falling into line. But don’t think this is over. Not by a long shot. There are a group of National MPs who seem pretty determined to get their way and they don’t seem to mind what the consequences are. That’s not something that is going to just pass. In my experience, it’s something which festers. Oh, and Indonesian president Joko Widodo is in town for a bilateral visit. He will address the parliament today, becoming only the second Indonesian leader to do so. And Zali Steggall, Helen Haines, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie will be releasing a climate bill today. They want a bipartisan approach to preparing for climate change and are hoping to get a conscience vote on the issue. Stay tuned for all of that and more as the day unfolds, with Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and a one-coffee me at your service. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/feb/19/epa-trump-boston-science-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-19T22:37:33Z","webTitle":"'Science for the people': researchers challenge Trump outside US conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/epa-trump-boston-science-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/epa-trump-boston-science-protest","fields":{"headline":"'Science for the people': researchers challenge Trump outside US conference","bodyText":"Hundreds of scientists rallied in Boston on Sunday to protest what they call the “direct attack” of Donald Trump and Republicans on research, scientific institutions and facts themselves, as a community reckons, and argues, with a new era of American politics. Gathering in Boston’s Copley Square, outside the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), several scientists gave speeches to a crowd holding signs shaped like beakers and reading “Stand up for science”. The speeches reflected a sea change in the culture of many labs and universities, where many researchers long maintained that good scientific work could speak for itself. At the AAAS conference, scientists this week have discussed political activism, the psychology of “fake news” , and how to protect climate science from hostile governments. But a rift has opened up in the community between those in favor and those opposed to rallies focused on science, including a March for Science planned across multiple cities in April. Professor Jim Gates, the eminent string theorist and former adviser to Barack Obama, told journalists that the march appeared to lack an end goal – a prerequisite for political action – and would simply be perceived as “science against Trump”. “At least as far as I can detect, there is no theory of action behind this,” he said. “This bothers me tremendously. “I don’t understand how the organisers of this march can guard against provocateurs, quite frankly,” he added. “I don’t think they’re ready for that, I don’t think they’re considering that kind of danger. To have science represented as this political force I think is just extraordinarily dangerous.” Others urged the protesters on, including Rush Holt, the CEO of AAAS, said that his organization would work with other US societies to “make the march a success”. “It’s the first time in my 50-year career that I have seen people speaking up for science at large,” he said. “I’ve seen for or against nuclear power or whatever. This is an unusual phenomenon.” Astrid Caldas, a climate scientist and member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the rally showed that “scientists who are usually happy in the corner of their labs are speaking”. “I think that scientists are realizing that they have to use their voice, as scientists, in self-defense.” Dr Jacquelyn Gill, an ecologist at the University of Maine, was one of the speakers Sunday, and is tentatively considering whether to run for Congress in 2018. “A lot of scientists are realizing that the institutions that fund and support and science in this country – science for everyone, publicly funded and transparent – those institutions are under direct attack,” she told the Guardian. Trump, she said, “not only doesn’t value our institutions, he doesn’t seem to value evidence-based decision making at all. That is alarming to us.” The president’s views about science – he has variously called global warming a “hoax” and pledged to “unlock the mysteries of space” – is not the only concern on the scientists’ minds. “I’m concerned that we’re going to lose the EPA. I’m concerned that we’re going to lose regulations that have a direct impact on human health, like automobile emissions,” Gill said. “People will get sicker. People will die because of a lack of environmental regulation and medical research.” Beka Economopoulos, one of the rally’s organizers and a co-founder of the Natural History Museum, a mobile exhibition, said that scientists could no longer truly avoid politics. “That ship has sailed,” she said, noting that researchers have a long history protesting, for instance against nuclear proliferation in the 1970s. “It’s not just about scientists, it’s about science,” she said. “Communities are going to bear the brunt of the impacts of these attacks on science in the public interest.” Gill also stressed that the nascent movement wanted to stress “science for the people, by the people and for the people”. Arguments about “trimming the fat” of budgets, she said, did not stand up to scrutiny, considering that the government’s science and medical research funding makes up a tiny percentage of the federal budget. “That money has got one of the best returns on investment you could possibly hope for,” she said. “The real stakeholders are the citizens that stand to gain or lose the most if the institutions are weakened.” Another organizer, Emily Southard, said that the rally and the march in Washington, were meant to help “demystify what scientists do”. She defended “science that delivers clean, safe drinking water to our faucets, science that’s being taken for granted – and that’s the science that’s being taken under attack.” Economopoulos used the Environmental Protection Agency as an example, criticizing its newly confirmed head, who repeatedly sued the agency in favor of corporations as Oklahoma attorney general . “We have a sort of fox in the henhouse situation here with Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA, an agency that he has sued 14 times,” she said. Gill also said that researchers needed to do more to take control of their image, noting the ways scientists had been politicized by lawmakers in debates over climate science. “Throwing more information or more data doesn’t really change minds, whether it’s climate change or vaccines,” she said. “Empathy trumps fact when it comes to people’s minds.” Such disputes were nothing new, she said: “Science and religion clashes go back to Darwin and Galileo and Copernicus.” Caldas said that she hoped scientists would continue organize at local levels. “The federal government may not be on board, but local government works hardest with people who see these problems at their doorsteps, and they cannot deny it.” Members of Congress facing re-election, she said, were already starting to feel pressure from constituents about climate change. “The stakes are really high but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/13/power-stations-to-get-early-warning-against-jellyfish-invasions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-13T14:27:57Z","webTitle":"Power stations to get early warning against jellyfish invasions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/power-stations-to-get-early-warning-against-jellyfish-invasions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/13/power-stations-to-get-early-warning-against-jellyfish-invasions","fields":{"headline":"Power stations to get early warning against jellyfish invasions","bodyText":"Invasions of jellyfish have proved adept at shutting down power plants in recent years. But an early warning tool is now in development to alert power stations to incoming swarms which block the cooling water intakes of coastal plants. EDF’s Torness nuclear power plant in Scotland was closed for a week in 2011 after a mass of moon jellyfish invaded and the company is now working with researchers from the University of Bristol to tackle the problem. Jellyfish swarms have also closed nuclear and coal power plants in Sweden, the US and Japan in recent years, and the new forecast tool is being designed to work in all oceans. Israeli power stations have also had jellyfish problems, while the Philippines suffered a massive blackout in 1999 after 50 truck loads of jellyfish had to be removed, and a US nuclear-powered warship, the USS Ronald Reagan, was incapacitated when visiting Australia in 2006. “They can build up a population extremely quickly,” said Erica Hendy, at Bristol University. A lack of historical records makes it hard to say whether jellyfish blooms are increasing because of climate change or the overfishing of their predators. The project will use a supercomputer to model how currents sweep jellyfish blooms across oceans and how this changes over the year. Jellyfish have very limited ability to swim, but the model will take account of how they move up and down during the day, avoid rough surface conditions during storms and how their buoyancy changes as they age. Using data from recent invasions, the researchers will backtrack to identify the hotspots where the blooms are likely to have developed and where monitoring should be put in place to spot them early. EDF is already researching whether satellite imaging or drones could be used as lookouts. Once a bloom is identified the new system should be able to predict where and when jellyfish are likely to hit the coast. “EDF would like as long a warning as possible, so they could send out local fishing crews to remove the bloom before they get anywhere near the coast,” said Hendy. Pietro Bernardara, from EDF Energy, said: “Jellyfish swarms are an occasional but challenging issue for our power stations. They can have an impact on the amount of electricity we are able to supply to consumers and can cost the business money. That is why [we] are pleased to be working with the University of Bristol to develop a tool that will allow us to continue delivering, safe, secure and responsible nuclear electricity.” The project is also supported by energy company SSE, which has a gas-fired power station on the coast at Peterhead in Scotland, and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation. In 2014, 300,000 salmon were killed by an invasion of mauve stinger jellyfish on North Uist in Scotland’s Western Isles. The 18-month project will build on work developed to study the dispersal of coral larvae and has £160,000 of government funding from the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council. It could also be adapted to analyse flows of seaweed, which closed the Torness nuclear plant in 2013."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/15/wednesday-briefing-hotline-to-moscow","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-15T06:57:52Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Hotline to Moscow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/wednesday-briefing-hotline-to-moscow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/15/wednesday-briefing-hotline-to-moscow","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Hotline to Moscow","bodyText":"Top story: Damning accounts of Trump circle’s Russian contacts Good morning, this is Warren Murray bringing you today’s Guardian morning briefing. Fresh scandal has erupted over the relationship between Donald Trump’s election campaign and the Kremlin after US intelligence officials said there were frequent contacts between the would-be president’s aides and Russian intelligence. The National Security Agency intercepted “constant communication” between high-level Trump advisers and “Russians known to US intelligence” over the course of the past year, according to reports that cited current and former intelligence officials. Trump has previously denied there were any such contacts. But suspicions about Moscow’s influence over the president are picking up serious momentum. After the White House national security adviser quit over his talks with Russia’s ambassador, it has emerged that Trump apparently knew weeks ago that Michael Flynn had misled the vice-president about those conversations. Calls are growing in Congress for a full investigation. * * * Killing of Kim Jong-nam – The apparent assassination in Malaysia of Kim Jong-un’s brother, Kim Jong-nam, adds the strangest instalment yet to a catalogue of paranoid executions and purges by the North Korean ruler. But we should not allow the “comic book” character of such episodes to cloud the fact that this same regime has let off nuclear bombs and seems more determined than ever to make one fly, as Simon Tisdall writes. * * * Paul Nuttall and Hillsborough – A Ukip press officer has sought to take the blame for mistakenly publishing a claim that party leader Paul Nuttall lost “close friends” in the Hillsborough stadium disaster. Lynda Roughley said she was “entirely responsible” for the website post. But the Stoke Central byelection candidate continued to be challenged over his insistence that he was at the stadium on the day of the disaster in 1989. His father has backed him up but a teacher, a schoolmate and Hillsborough justice campaigners are among those casting doubt. * * * Darker materials – Calibrate your alethiometer and prepare to be plunged back into the multiverse of daemons, Dust and the tyrannical Magisterium … Philip Pullman has thrilled fans by announcing three new novels to stand alongside the fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials. The new series, entitled The Book of Dust, will tell the story of heroine Lyra before and after the events of Northern Lights, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass. Pullman said he wanted to delve into the true nature of “Dust”, the mysterious substance at the centre of the original novels. * * * ‘Huge explosion’ in Oxford – People were feared missing after a blast followed by a fire at a block of flats in the Osney Lane and Gibbs Crescent area of the city. Six fire crews with 40 firefighters were called in. Several people were treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries, with one woman taken to hospital. Police were still at the scene overnight. * * * No longer managing – Poverty looms for four million more “just about managing” Britons as inflation pushes up costs while tax credits and working-age benefits remain frozen, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is warning. There are already more than 19 million people living below the minimum income for a decent standard of living, according to one nationally recognised benchmark, and high employment levels are not helping because so many jobs are low-paid. Lunchtime read: The man with no name A pickup truck crash near the Mexican border in California left one of the passengers lying in a persistent vegetative state in a San Diego hospital. Unidentified for 16 years, this man became a symbol of hope for families from Mexico searching for boys and men who had disappeared after heading north. Sport Barcelona were hammered 4-0 by an Ángel Di María-inspired Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie while Arsène Wenger has insisted his Arsenal side are up for the “massive challenge” they face against Bayern in Munich tonight.

And a fight between UFC’s biggest star, Conor McGregor, and former boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather appears to be moving closer to reality. Business Investors are questioning whether Toshiba can survive after its shares plunged 11% on its admission that it had a $6.3bn blackhole in its accounts thanks to problems at its newly purchased American nuclear business Westinghouse. Asian shares hit their highest point for 19 months helped by a bullish night on Wall Street after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen flagged a possible interest rate rise next month. The pound is pretty flat this morning at US$1.25 and €1.18. The papers The FT leads with the troubles at Toshiba saying a key part of the UK’s energy strategy has been thrown into doubt with the company likely to abandon its lead role in a Cumbrian nuclear power station. Like many others the front-page picture is of the apparently assassinated brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The Mail splash is “The Plastic Bottle Betrayal” with the paper reporting that ministers are set to reject a scheme that would have put a deposit on bottles and cans in order to encourage recycling. The Times has the story that Amazon will get a tax cut on its business premises under new rules despite high street stores having to pay more in rates. The Mirror says a scientific study has linked heading footballs to early onset dementia with the Telegraph also leading on the story, saying professional football has become as dangerous as boxing.

Gone are the days when dictators and allies alike disdained a professorial president who preferred nuclear diplomacy to nuclear war. If only Barack Obama had played more golf at luxury resorts, his successor would not have to bring such golden luster to such a copper world. Less than 100 days into this presidency, it is blissfully clear what kind of leader Trump is. He has made the awesome transition from a neophyte candidate into a neophyte president; from a man who bluffed and blustered his way in TV debates to a man who bluffs and blusters his way through international crises. Here is a small-time businessman who knew nothing about foreign affairs, who has grown into a nuclear-armed president who knows nothing about foreign affairs. He used to fire B-list celebrities on TV; now he just fires off tweets and Tomahawks after watching TV. To put it mildly, it is troubling for any White House – at a time of high tensions with a rogue nuclear state – to act as dumb or duplicitous as Donald Trump. Machiavelli argued that it is better to be feared than loved. It’s also better to look like something other than a fool. Because that’s what you look like when you misstate the mission and location of an entire aircraft carrier group: specifically, the USS Carl Vinson, a Nimitz class, nuclear-powered beast of the seas, accompanied by a strike force of two destroyers and a cruiser. How does such confusion begin? In an epic interview with Fox Business Network, President Trump made it clear he was getting tough with North Korea. But he was also cunningly mysterious about what he was doing. “You never know, do you? You never know … I don’t want to talk about it,” he told his interviewer before, you know, talking about it. “We are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people on Earth. And I will say this. He is doing the wrong thing. He is doing the wrong thing.” As an explanation of a nuclear crisis, this is right up there with his February press conference, when he spilled the secrets about his classified briefings on nuclear war with Russia: “Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.” The only problem is that the Carl Vinson armada wasn’t sailing towards North Korea. It was sailing away from Pyongyang. A long, long way away: more than 3,500 miles away to the Indian Ocean for a joint exercise with the Australian navy. In any kind of standoff with a rogue nuclear power, it’s helpful to avoid this kind of buffoonery. Vice-President Mike Pence traveled to the Korean peninsula to warn the North not to test Donald Trump. He declared ominously that “the era of strategic patience is over” in what was surely the most reckless formulation of words since “the axis of evil” left the lips of George W Bush. Now we know that the era of strategic impatience needs to wait a little longer for the aircraft carrier to sail 3,500 miles back to the hot zone. Do not test Donald Trump’s resolve or, for that matter, his naval knowledge. The problem with this kind of chest-thumping is that it spills across the whole team of once professional adults. Defense secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser HR McMaster played their own part in leaving the impression that the aircraft carrier was steaming towards Korea. Serving a clueless boss, their reputations are growing tarnished on a daily basis, like that of the United States itself. The nuclear standoff with North Korea has already been compared to the Cuban missile crisis. So it’s worth recalling that when JFK wanted to win over France’s General de Gaulle, he sent Dean Acheson to show him the photographic proof that was leading the world to the brink of nuclear war. De Gaulle said he had no need to see the photos because he trusted Acheson, and the United States, to tell the truth. This kind of credibility is in desperately short supply in the hands of a president who explains his first military intervention in these terms, in his now infamous Fox Business interview: “I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner. We’re now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it. And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do?” What indeed? Like a wonderful ganache, this is a story that is so delicious it is sometimes hard to recall every crumb of detail. “So what happens is I said, ‘We’ve just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq and I wanted you to know this.’ And he was eating his cake. And he was silent.” If you were the Chinese president sitting opposite a nuclear-armed president who couldn’t tell Iraq from Syria, you too might remain silent and savor every bite of the last chocolate cake you might encounter on this planet. Based on his extensive viewing of Fox News, Trump had thought the North Korean crisis would be pretty simple to fix: a bit of pressure on President Xi to cut off North Korea’s economy, and hey presto! But it turns out this whole Asian thing is a bit harder to game out, as he explained to the Wall Street Journal. “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized that it’s not so easy,” he explained about trade across the North Korean border. “A lot of goods come in. But it’s not what you would think.” This is sadly not a once-in-a-blue-moon gaffe. It is a pattern of behavior that is only understandable among teenage students who prefer to play video games rather than tackle their homework. After all, this is how our president explained the North Korea crisis to another incisive interviewer on the wonderfully named show Fox and Friends: “I hope there’s going to be peace, but they’ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton’s book and he said, ‘Oh, we made such a great peace deal’ and it was a joke … You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed. They’ve all been outplayed by this gentleman, and we’ll see what happens.” Perhaps all North Korean leaders look alike to President Trump. But Clinton’s deal with North Korea was with the Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader Kim Jong-un. George W Bush may have lost all credibility by invading a country for non-existent weapons of mass destruction. But at least he knew which country he was invading, and which direction his ships were sailing in. He knew the difference between Saddam Hussein and King Hussein. The world is facing a unique challenge as Trump grapples with Kim. In a standoff between two unpredictable and vainglorious nuclear-armed leaders who are obsessed with pop culture and conspiracies, the only sane course of action is clear: focus on your chocolate cake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/20/can-england-avoid-a-meltdown-of-national-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T16:09:23Z","webTitle":"Can England avoid a meltdown of national identity? | Paul Mason","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/can-england-avoid-a-meltdown-of-national-identity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/can-england-avoid-a-meltdown-of-national-identity","fields":{"headline":"Can England avoid a meltdown of national identity?","bodyText":"Scotland can, should and hopefully will leave the United Kingdom. The question for non-Scottish Brits now is, if we are going to say goodbye to the union, how should we frame our own national consciousness after that? What institutions should we design? The original argument for independence was strong: Scotland has developed a national culture and consciousness on a different trajectory to that of England. Large numbers of its people are convinced their economic interest is harmed within the current structure of devolution. With a hard Brexit, all forms of devolution seem an inadequate protection from the bomb that is about to go off. Theresa May’s determination to pursue hard Brexit is the equivalent of stepping off a 10-metre diving board without checking there is any water in the pool below. But a no-deal Brexit will not only trigger severe economic dislocation. It will trigger an ideological crisis of all the nationalisms in the UK. English nationalism – half-formed, turbulent and untheorised at the moment it defeated Ed Miliband and then delivered Brexit – will be forced to become concrete. Leaping off the diving board handcuffed to May will be bad enough; leaping handcuffed to a people having a national identity meltdown is definitely something to avoid. I wrote on the morning after Miliband lost the election, that “I don’t want to be English”. The past 20 months have only strengthened that view. It is impossible to become passionate about a nationalism that did not exist when you were at school; whose key symbols have had to be cleansed and re-cleansed of association with xenophobia and racism, and which – above all – had no basis in economic reality until last year. My passport says I am British. Thirty years of globalisation, travel and education have left me – unapologetically – one of those “citizens of nowhere” derided by May. At school, we were taught about the British empire, its crimes and victories. I learned that, at Waterloo, the Gordon Highlanders clung to the stirrups of the Scots Greys as they charged. Nobody told me that image would one day have to become something “other” to my own national identity. Ditto for the image of King’s Own Scottish Borderers dug in at Arnhem. English literature meant learning not only the poems of Robert Burns alongside Keats but also those of the Irishmen, Yeats and Wilde. Sure, there probably exists a form of Anglo-Saxon English, uninflected by the lilt of Celtic or the syntax of people from Britain’s former colonies. But I don’t know anybody who speaks it. However, English national consciousness is becoming a logical response to the way the world is changing. Even if, as Gordon Brown proposed at the weekend, Scotland accepts a federal settlement – the Bank of England becoming the central bank of an effective sterling union, etc – England must be given its own democratic institutions. But if Scotland leaves – and Northern Ireland is given some kind of halfway status to prevent a border being re-erected with the Republic – then what’s left cannot be called “rUK” – the rump or remainder UK. It will be England-Plus. This new country will still be a major global economy, a nuclear power (albeit in need of a new port for its nuclear-armed submarines), a permanent member of the UN Security Council and home to the head of the Commonwealth. And it will need an ideology. But here is where the problem begins. Just as it’s hard to deglobalise a national economy, breaking up an imperialist ideology into its constituent parts is going to be very tricky. The British imperial ideology, and its post-imperial successor after 1945 was the creation of a national bourgeoisie. Wellington’s reported comment about Waterloo being won on the playing fields of Eton was not fatuous: the creation of an elite with a common approach for conquering and dividing other countries, and ruling its own, required a common set of economic practices. The modern English elite is scarcely a national bourgeoisie at all. It is, at best, a multi-ethnic community of innovators and financiers who happen to live here, heavily intermarried with old English – and Scottish – money. Watch a rugby match at a top British private school and you will understand how anachronistic Wellington’s comment would seem today. However, if Nicola Sturgeon leads Scotland to independence by 2020, establishing something close to the Scandinavian model of capitalism on British soil, the English elite will have to come up with a new story. You can see it forming now, in the pages of the rightwing magazines and websites feeding off the corpse of liberal conservatism. Scotland’s desire for independence is being cast no longer as simply unwise (as in 2014) but unjust. It is being subtly reframed by the English right as a form of theft, disloyalty, disobedience and disruption, a wilful sabotage of the Brexit process. If the left and centre of English politics do not resist this – and consciously offer something different – this anti-Scottish resentment story will become the core of the new English ideology. It already has, as Patrick Cockburn pointed out in the Independent, something in common with the resurgent European nationalisms: ethnic and cultural exclusivity. So what can we do? Some figures on the left have argued for an English parliament. I dismissed this proposal two years ago, but Brexit has convinced me the federal argument is strong. That raises the question: what form should English federal institutions take? Given the opportunity to redesign the English political institutions along federal lines, we should push not for an English assembly, but for powerful regional states, along the lines of the German länder. The result might look a lot like the map of the British isles around 830 AD, once Wessex was a unified kingdom – with the equivalents of Mercia, Northumbria and Wales each having a devolved assembly. Here is why I favour that solution over a single English parliament: in any English parliament, the south-east will dominate; and the emergent ideology of an English nation state will form itself around the white, military-monarchic and financial elite. With the Scots gone, their replacements as the social laboratory for far-right economics will be the north and the Midlands of England. If we are really unlucky, and Ukip does not evaporate, the racial and religious exclusivity ideologies will get stronger. Better to create a strong federal institution at the centre – and offer Scotland and the Republic of Ireland strong bilateral arrangements over, for example, defence and trade – and then create strong regional assemblies. That is the best way of representing the separate regional identities of the English, and of allowing Wales to participate as an equal to the other regions, rather than as an appendage to Great England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/15/wild-is-the-wind-the-resource-that-could-power-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-15T13:00:31Z","webTitle":"Wild is the wind: the resource that could power the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/15/wild-is-the-wind-the-resource-that-could-power-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/15/wild-is-the-wind-the-resource-that-could-power-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Wild is the wind: the resource that could power the world","bodyText":"The wind rips along the Humber estuary in Hull. It’s the kind that presses your coat to your back and pushes you on to your toes. “A bit too windy,” shouts Andy Sykes, before his words are swept away. He is the head of operational excellence at the Siemens Gamesa factory, which supplies blades – the bits that turn – to windfarms in the North Sea. At 75 metres long, they are hard to manoeuvre when it’s gusting. Inside the vast factory hall, the blades lie in various states of undress. Several hundred layers of fibreglass and balsa wood are being tucked into giant moulds by hand. There are “naked” blades that require paint and whose bodies have the patina of polished tortoiseshell. Look through the hollow blades from the broadest part, and a pale green path, the tinge of fibreglass, snakes down the long tunnel, tapering to a small burst of daylight at its tip. “Alice in Wonderland,” Sykes says. “That’s how I feel. That’s the emotion coming through. It’s 75 metres long. We know that. But stood here the perspective is just fantastic. It’s my favourite view.” Down this strange green rabbithole is a glimpse of a greener future, the possibility of a world powered by wind. This is not as fanciful a vision as it once seemed. In the UK, the wind energy industry is celebrating. Last month, the cost of renewable energy dropped dramatically to undercut by almost half the government’s projections for 2025. At £57.50 per megawatt-hour (MWh), it is far cheaper than the state-backed price of £92.50 awarded in 2016 to Hinkley nuclear power station. The speed of wind’s progress is extreme and inarguable. Emma Pinchbeck, executive director of RenewableUK, and a former climate change activist, can’t keep the happiness from her voice. But she is happy for new reasons. What’s really exciting, she says, is the fact that she “is not having to talk to officials about decarbonisation any more as a starting point. Windfarms are low carbon. But that’s not why we want to build them. We want to build them because they’re bloody cheap!” Wind is in the news. And not just in terms of the energy it provides. One after another, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate have devastated the Caribbean and parts of the US mainland. In the UK, with a turbulent autumn looming, this month marks the 30th anniversary of 1987’s great storm, which felled 15 million trees in one night. A book exploring this event, Windblown: Landscape, Legacy and Loss, sold in a keenly contested auction last year and has just been published. Another new book, Where the Wild Winds Are, sees its author, Nick Hunt, walk the “invisible pathways” of Europe’s winds. In short, wind is in the air. But why do lay people know so little about it – and can it really power the world? The wind energy sector is certainly booming. Across the river from the Siemens Gamesa factory in Hull, in this long windy corridor of development on the east coast of the windiest country in Europe, there’s the Dong Energy hub, the screens of its operation room flickering with the data of wind captured by blades turning in the North Sea. Next month, the company will change its name – short for Danish Oil and Natural Gas – to Ørsted, after the celebrated Danish scientist who discovered that electric currents create magnetic fields, to reflect its near complete shift from black energy to green. Dong was among the companies that achieved the landmark price of £57.50, and Emma Toulson, who works in their Grimsby office, explains how they did it. Since the government ruled out new onshore windfarms in England – a promise in its 2015 manifesto – energy companies have been forced offshore, making the UK the world’s offshore leader. Allowed to develop beyond the vision of land-dwellers who see windfarms as a blot on the countryside, the turbines have grown steadily larger, as have the farms to which they belong. Dong’s Hornsea Project Two will span 480 sq km, and Toulson’s PowerPoint outlines a large jagged blue diamond for Project Three and an even larger blue rocket shape for Four. Toulson has a slide that shows one very clear reason for the falling cost of wind energy. Over time, the diameter of the blades have enlarged. A turbine commissioned in 2002 swept 80 metres; in 2005, that figure rose to 90 metres; in 2011, it was 120 metres. By 2020, it will be 180 metres. Of course, the supply chain has improved, and there have been engineering refinements. But put baldly, wind energy costs less, and will go on costing less, because the turbines are growing taller and the blades longer. The manufacturers of these machines are in a race to produce the largest. Making something bigger in each incarnation seems a very basic idea of advancement. How much of a future is there in a pursuit of progress through perpetual excess? Andrew Garrad co-founded Garrad Hassan, which has grown to become the world’s largest wind consultancy. “When I started, in 1984, I could carry the biggest wind turbine blade on my back,” he says. “I’ve made all sorts of embarrassing pronouncements about how big the blades can get … Never bigger than 50 metres or 70 metres or 90 metres, and I’m always wrong.” One limit is that if a blade can’t support its own weight, it buckles. And the size at which this would happen? Garrad laughs. “About 1.5km in length.” To add to the sense of the fantastical, last week two scientists from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University, California, published a study that suggested a windfarm the size of India, in the North Atlantic, could power the world. “A generation doesn’t last long in wind,” Garrad says. A new one is born every three to four years. Progress has been so fast that this year saw the first decommissioning of an offshore windfarm, Vindeby, in Denmark. At 25 years old, it is practically ancient, its entire output exceeded by that of a single 8MW Vestas turbine. And yet despite the size of its gargantuan machines, the offshore wind industry is still in its infancy. Wind turbines may look alike, but as Garrad points out, “we are a long way from a design consensus”. There are fixed turbines and floating turbines, which can access deeper seas, turbines with gears and turbines without. The sight of three blades harmoniously turning has become commonplace. But there is no reason why offshore turbines should look like this. They could operate with a single blade (ruled out on land because one blade, whirring faster, is noisy), or with two blades (ruled out on land because an optical illusion makes them appear to pause as they pass the tower, flummoxing passersby). Offshore, there would be only the gulls to offend, and the people who will live, in four-weekly shifts, on the new accommodation vessels that are being deployed to manage the farms’ growing distance from shore. The open ocean is a blank blue slate. “An engineer’s dream,” Garrad muses, who built his first windmill from old bicycle parts in his back garden when he was 17. When he was older, he climbed to the top of one of the first giant turbines and stuck his head out of the nacelle – the bit near the blades that houses the components – just to feel the wind in his hair. “You poke your head through the trapdoor and you get the most fantastic feeling of the power of the wind,” he says, his voice growing faster, louder. “You can feel the torque on the rotor, feel the blades bending, and the whole machine taking the power out of the wind … That first primordial step from the wind itself into the rotating shaft.” Wind has long had a transformative power in myths and legends. From Aeolus, the keeper of the winds in Greek mythology, to Vayu, the Hindu god of wind and Native American legends, humans have toyed with the idea of capturing it. (This preoccupation can be seen in object form at the Bora wind museum in Trieste, Italy: it has an exhibition of gusts trapped in bottles, sent in by wind lovers from around the world.) Wind is a metaphor for change, the passage of time, the past and the future (“The answer, my friend …”). It blows through the art of Van Gogh, through Hokusai to the far western tip of Cornwall and Gill Watkiss, whose landscapes are peopled by figures permanently bent, snapped over by the wind, hair whipped. “I like to feel it playing havoc with me,” she says. “You feel alive.” Humans have a complex relationship with the wind. We have many names for rain, from mizzle to drizzle, torrents to downpours. But wind is different. “There are no borders to the wind. It blows across land, across oceans. It’s bigger than we can imagine,” says Tamsin Treverton Jones, who wrote Windblown. We know it by how it sounds or feels, which is severe enough in places for scientists to have explored the link between strong winds and suicide, and by the damage it leaves behind. Poets aside, we have few words for the wind between a breeze and a gale. Even the Beaufort scale, which measures wind speed, categorises it specifically in relation to its impact on objects. Ted Hughes knew a “brunt wind”. Robert Macfarlane knows a “katrizper”, an Orcadian wind derived from the Norse for cat scratches. Watkiss, the Cornish artist, tells “exhilarating” wind by the way the telegraph wires hum. Debra Nicholson at the Wind Energy Museum in Great Yarmouth, with its bunting gently flapping over an assortment of 20th-century windmills, cites a 45-degree wind – one that gusts so hard, you have to walk into it at that angle. And a few miles away at E.ON’s Scroby Sands windfarm visitor centre, there’s talk of a “scowl”, a wind that whips around in all directions. Just along the promenade a kiosk sells children’s windmills and, at the dock, hulking Siemens Gamesa blades lie ready to be taken to sea. But while most of us know what wind does and how it sounds, we don’t know what it is, or why it blows when air at the earth’s surface moves to equalise low and high pressure areas. There is much still to understand. Ken Caldeira is one of the two Stanford climate scientists behind the idea of a North Atlantic windfarm the size of India. To understand the significance of his discovery, he says, it is important to know that when wind turbines are arrayed in rows, the extraction of wind by the first row reduces the amount of wind available for the second row, and so on. Row by row, the wind’s potential diminishes. To counter this effect, turbines need to extract energy from the wind that’s above them. What Caldeira found was that that is exactly what can happen in parts of the North Atlantic, where heat “pours out of the ocean”, causing greater “cyclonic activity”. But could a farm the size of India really be built in open ocean? “You wouldn’t want to,” he says. Better to have many very large ones (China currently has the largest). A wind power station that size “would be a climate change in itself”. For one thing, “pulling that much energy out of the sky shifts the direction of wind”. The challenges facing the wind energy industry remain immense. These include global political challenges: the presence of a climate-change sceptic in the White House, the UK government’s dislike of onshore wind (cheaper and so far more productive than offshore) and the potential impact of Brexit. There are technical challenges, too, such as the difficulty of storing the energy captured. Batteries for this purpose – such as the E.ON facility that opened in Sheffield last week – are still developing and are crucial to securing the supply, making it reliable. But still, the possibilities are immense. “The total amount of power in winds globally is something like 50 times bigger than the total amount of power used by human civilisation,” Caldeira reckons. “If we were to power civilisation by winds, we would need to capture about 2% of winds today,” he says, sounding a little like Odysseus on his way home from Troy, bag of winds in hand. And if the ocean is a blank blue state, there is another one above. The idea has been floated. Wind turbines on kites are in research and development. The jet stream, for Caldeira, is “the largest, most concentrated renewable energy source on the planet, 20 times as potent in every square metre as direct sunlight in the middle of the day”. No one thinks that wind alone offers the answer to the world’s energy needs. But for now, at least, the possibilities are boundless."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/apr/18/labour-jeremy-corbyn-time-to-fight-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-18T13:40:50Z","webTitle":"Labour is in deep trouble, but it’s our only defence against a Tory landslide | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/18/labour-jeremy-corbyn-time-to-fight-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/18/labour-jeremy-corbyn-time-to-fight-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"Labour is in deep trouble, but it’s our only defence against a Tory landslide","bodyText":"Theresa May can never be trusted on anything she says ever again. She is a patently dishonest politician who cannot keep her word, because for her, partisan self-interest is more important. Her position was clear. A few weeks ago, May’s spokesperson said: “There isn’t going to be one. It isn’t going to happen. There is not going to be a general election.” May claims that her U-turn on a snap general election was driven by the threat of Brexit being obstructed by parliament. This is a lie. There is no obstruction. To the chagrin of many ardent remainers, Labour voted through article 50 and emphasised it would respect the will of the British people. May was the remainer who reinvented herself as a hard Brexiteer, again for partisan self-interest. May was the leader who allowed her chancellor to break a key Tory election pledge on national insurance, only to U-turn when the betrayal became impossible to argue for because of her small majority. She said that now wasn’t the time for a Scottish independence referendum because of the instability it would cause, and then plumps for an unnecessary general election. She announced a pause on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station and then – under pressure from China’s regime – U-turned. You Can’t Trust May is just one possible approach for Labour as election-weary voters ask why they have been asked to yet again march to polling stations. But, look. Labour’s current polling is very, very bad indeed: you can’t try to climb a mountain if you are deluded about how high it is. The threat of an early election these past few months should have haunted every moment, for Labour’s left and its trade union allies: those of us who wanted a Labour party that was firmly rooted on the left on the economy, tax and public services, and which could inspire enough people to vote for it. A man who stood only out of a sense of duty, to put policies on the agenda, and who certainly had no ambition to be leader, will now take Labour into a general election, against all his original expectations. My suggestion that Corbyn stand down in favour of another candidate was driven by a desire to save his policies – which, as the polling shows, are very popular indeed – from being buried in the rubble of a terrible election defeat. They made the decision last June and since – yes, in accordance with the majority of Corbyn’s supporters – not to do so. So now what we must do is unite and do our very best to prevent a Tory landslide that would be calamitous for the country. This referendum is about Brexit above all else. Labour has understandably agonised over losing the minority of its voters who plumped for leave, not least in its northern heartlands and among older voters who are more motivated to turn out to cast their ballots. It must now make a pitch, too, for despondent remainers. Yes, that means reassuring leave voters that they will respect the referendum result. But the party must pitch for the 48% who voted remain. May has nothing but contempt for them. They are being not just ignored, but demonised. They are being denied a say over the future of our country. Only Labour can represent you, and the party will do so with every fibre of its being. Labour will stay in the single market and the customs union. That must be the argument. The party must say: we will defend the rights and benefits that we currently have, which benefit the majority of the country. That will be the basis of any Brexit deal. If the Tories win an immense majority, a ruinous hard Brexit could beckon. If you want to put jobs, the economy and living standards first, you must vote Labour to stop a landslide victory that could turn Britain into a barren tax haven run in the interests of billionaires. Wages are starting to fall: no doubt just one reason why this election was called. Rather than going back to diagnosing a “cost of living crisis”, Labour must set out how it will cure it. Some will be tempted to vote for the Lib Dems again. Their years of propping up a Tory government – which has led Britain to this calamitous moment – must be emphasised. Tim Farron is on record committing his party once again to a coalition with the Conservatives. He even sided with Donald Trump as soon as he started firing missiles. There is no party so demonstrably dishonest in modern British political history. In any case, our electoral system means that Lib Dem chances of winning a considerable number of seats to champion the remain cause are minimal. As has been noted, Labour’s recent policies are indeed electorally very popular. You don’t win elections, though, with policies that – taken individually – have high levels of support, as Ed Miliband discovered. There has to be a vision to bring them together. If you don’t define what you are for, you will be defined by your opponents, already the critical problem afflicting Labour’s leadership. You need a sunny, optimistic vision, not a miserable shaking of the stick at everything that’s wrong. Investing in the Future, for example. Labour privately briefs that the theme of its recent policies is standing up for the 99% and standing up to the 1%. That has to be conveyed in a short, snappy phrase – like Long Term Economic Plan did for the Tories. Above all else: find a vision and stick to it, relentlessly. Every policy you announce must then slip into that frame: so rather than being another good idea thrown into the ether, it emphasises to the electorate what you are about. And here’s a message for Labour’s immense grassroots army. This is your moment. No excuses: every single one must take to the streets, knocking on doors every possible night that you can, getting the message across, ensuring that on election day there’s the biggest get out the vote operation in the history of British democracy. That may make a sizeable difference in terms of how many seats are won or lost. Voting in a leadership election was not enough, or even close. Go out and fight with everything you have. There is no point being dishonest here. The Tories have called this election for naked partisan interest: it is cynical and dishonest, but from their own perspective, the logic is self-evident. Everything will now be thrown at Labour and its leadership: and the party starts from a very low base indeed. Corbyn decided to stay, and – with the national platform he will now have – he and his team must prove they can put forward an inspiring and coherent vision. Expose a dishonest Theresa; fight for a Brexit deal that puts jobs, the economy and living standards first; and stand for a Britain run in the interests of the majority, not the elites. Save the postmortem for whatever happens. Now it’s the time to fight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2017/mar/19/brexit-britain-talking-trade-deal-eu-wrong-talking-point","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-19T11:20:05Z","webTitle":"Brexit Britain is suddenly debating trade – but it's the wrong talking point | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2017/mar/19/brexit-britain-talking-trade-deal-eu-wrong-talking-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2017/mar/19/brexit-britain-talking-trade-deal-eu-wrong-talking-point","fields":{"headline":"Brexit Britain is suddenly debating trade – but it's the wrong talking point","bodyText":"Brexit has turned Britain into a nation of trade nerds. In the past nine months, trade has gone from being too boring to mention into a subject about which everybody has a view. Those who eyes would once have glazed over at the mention of bound tariffs or trade facilitation agreements can now wax lyrical about what it would mean for Britain if it had to rely on World Trade Organistion rules after it leaves the EU. The new sexiness of trade was illustrated last week when the former head of the WTO made a speech at the Institute for Government in London. Pascal Lamy spent some of the best years of his life struggling to polish off the Doha round of trade liberalisation and an overspill room was needed to hear what he had to say about Britain’s likely post-Brexit deal. Battle-scarred as he is, Lamy has no illusions about the difficulties of the negotiations that will follow the triggering of article 50 by the government later this month. He had a nice metaphor for the likely complexity of the talks: separating an egg from an omelette. And a warning born of experience: it won’t be achieved within two years. Lamy divided the issues facing the negotiators into three categories: things that will be simple; things that will be more complex; and things that will be really complex. In what might come as a surprise to the UK’s new army of trade experts, Lamy said the creation of a free trade deal would be simple. It was a “no brainer” that there would be zero tariffs so that integrated supply chains did not suffer. It would also be easy enough for the UK to keep the trade with countries that have signed bilateral agreements with the EU. Fishing could also turn out to be less difficult than expected if the EU and the UK maintained mutual access for their fleets. Lamy then outlined a few of the more complex issues. The EU has defences to protect against the dumping of goods at below global market prices. It also has rules governing the state aid that member countries can provide to their domestic firms and a public procurement regime that allows German companies to bid for government contracts in the UK. There are competition laws, a common EU approach to environmental standards, and to climate change. The EU negotiators will say that a free trade deal with the UK cannot happen if Westminster wants to tilt the playing field in favour of British companies through state aid or public procurement. Nor would the EU be willing to see any dilution of its regulations that set the technical standards for goods that can be sold across the single market. This, Lamy said, is where the issues become really complex. It is one thing, he added, to have a trade deal that is tariff-free and quota-free, but the EU has tough product standards. “That’s a major problem unless the UK agrees systematically to follow the continental standards,” Lamy said. Agreeing to match a constantly evolving EU regime without having any say in making the new rules would likely prove politically unacceptable to the UK government. Other issues that were likely to cause problems were tax, intellectual property protection and the departure of the UK from European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). Tax is a particularly tricky issue because outside the EU it would be open to Britain to make radical changes to VAT. The boost to export competitiveness since Brexit is a demonstration of how the UK already has more monetary policy flexibility than those EU countries inside the eurozone: the EU 27 will want assurances that Philip Hammond and his successors will not exploit fiscal flexibility as well. The recent history of trade talks suggests Lamy is right when he says the less obvious stuff will be the toughest to resolve. The negotiations between Washington and Brussels for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) ran into difficulties primarily because agreeing common technical standards is a long and arduous business. It had little to do with tariffs, which are already low. Likewise, trade negotiations – whether at a bilateral or multilateral level – are now dominated by arguments about intellectual property rights. So when Lamy says it might take five or six years for the UK and the EU to finalise a deal, that seems a reasonable estimate. One way of shortening the process would be for the UK to declare unilateral free trade no matter what the EU does. Another would be to take a leaf out of Donald Trump’s book and turn more protectionist. Lamy’s analysis suggests a third option is possible, though not easy. The UK would not be a member of the single market or the customs union but it would get a free trade deal with the EU. That would mean Britain would not be subject to free movement of labour – the big prize for Theresa May in the negotiations. But this would come at a price. The UK government would not have a free hand when it came to state aid or tax. It would have to accept EU regulations, not just now but in the future as well. Would this be an acceptable deal? Perhaps not to the ultras on either side. There might be some across the Channel who would consider this as not tough enough on Britain. There are certainly some free-market zealots who believe one of the big advantages of Brexit is that it will lead to a bonfire of EU regulations. Yet, as Lamy pointed out, anything that has costs for the UK has costs for the EU27 as well. And these are costs the Italian, Greek, Portuguese, French, Finnish and even German economies could do without. The UK government, for its part, would have to consider whether such a deal would be sellable to the public. It probably would be. Brexit happened because of concerns about immigration not because voters wanted the freedom to have dirtier beaches or less safe nuclear power stations. It will take time to arrive at this sort of compromise because negotiations always begin with both sides insisting that they get everything they want. It will prove impossible if there is no give and take. Jeremy Browne, the former Liberal Democrat MP who is now the City of London’s special representative to the EU, said at the Lamy talk that the result of the referendum meant Brexit had to happen but that there was no reason why it should be as acrimonious as some are expecting. “Negotiations normally start with a dysfunctional relationship. But this [the relationship between the UK and the EU] is a functioning relationship. The question is how much dysfunctionality do the politicians wish to inject?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/14/eyes-throat-burning-what-caused-birling-gap-toxic-cloud","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"'Suddenly my eyes and throat started burning': what caused Birling Gap's toxic cloud?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/14/eyes-throat-burning-what-caused-birling-gap-toxic-cloud","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/14/eyes-throat-burning-what-caused-birling-gap-toxic-cloud","fields":{"headline":"'Suddenly my eyes and throat started burning': what caused Birling Gap's toxic cloud?","bodyText":"Mark Sawyer has worked for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution for nearly 30 years, and since 2001 he’s been the full-time coxswain at the Eastbourne lifeboat station. Shortly after 5pm on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend last August, he received a report from the coastguard in Southampton about an incident at a beach seven miles west of his station. “The call we got was that there had either been a fire or an explosion at Birling Gap, and they’d got 50-plus casualties suffering from smoke inhalation or burns.” There was what looked like a layer of thick smoke hanging just above the sea. Birling Gap is a popular National Trust spot between Beachy Head and Seaford, a dip in the chalk cliffs of the Seven Sisters, with a steel staircase leading down to a pebble beach. At low tide there is sand and rockpools; on the cliffs above there is a visitor centre, cafe, car park and coastguard station. By 6pm that Sunday, the beach had been evacuated and a major incident declared, and Eastbourne district general hospital was carrying out one of the biggest mass decontaminations in NHS history. The gas or vapour appeared to come rolling along the shore from the east. “We could see this yellowy haze in the air,” a member of the Eastbourne coastguard team says. “It was almost like the film The Fog.” (The fog of John Carpenter’s 1980 horror brings with it the malevolent ghosts of drowned sailors.) Others describe it as clear, or blueish, or sandy. In the frenetic smartphone footage from the scene it looks like a vapour, with a yellow tint, though this might be an effect of the low, late-afternoon sun. It was reported variously as having an odour of chlorine, ammonia and burning plastic. Others say it had no odour, but more of a taste, a chemical astringency in the throat. “We’ve got the water-treatment works near the harbour,” Sawyer says, “but that’s a different smell, I can assure you. The fishermen used to say if the wind’s in the right direction, you can smell your way back to Eastbourne.” A taxi driver who had been nearby at the time says with disarming certainty that it smelled of “potash and corpses”. Meanwhile, Sawyer and his RNLI colleagues were approaching Birling Gap from the east, in their lifeboat Diamond Jubilee. It had been an exceptionally busy 24 hours for the station, even by the standards of a hot bank holiday weekend. Just after midnight a car had been driven over Beachy Head, close to Birling Gap, and the RNLI had spent the morning at the scene. Around 11am, having been up much of the night, the crew was called to recover a body that had been spotted by a fishing boat. That afternoon they also undertook one of the RNLI’s lesser-known roles, the scattering of ashes at sea. They were flagging when the call came in about Birling Gap. “As we were leaving, the coastguard told us they were getting unconfirmed reports that people were suffering from the effects of a poisonous gas,” Sawyer says, as we sit in his office overlooking Eastbourne’s Sovereign Harbour. “As we went towards the west we could see this haze, and all of a sudden our eyes started to burn and you could feel the back of your throat burning. We were told in no uncertain terms, ‘Get into the wheelhouse and shut the doors.’” *** It took a while for Laura Knight, a drama therapist from Brighton, to realise anything was wrong. She had been on the beach since about 2pm, with her partner and two children, aged six and nine. They were planning a barbecue. “The height of the tide at that time meant the beach was quite thin, and everybody was crammed on the shingle. We had a little swim, everyone was enjoying the sun, and then we started noticing that people were coughing and their eyes were streaming.” It resembled a dense, morning sea mist, she says. “It started slowly to come in, then you lost sight of the cliffs.” Later that afternoon, Eastbourne’s Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, was at Cork airport in Ireland, waiting for a flight home after a weekend break, when texts started coming in about the haze. “So I make some calls and I learn a ‘poisonous gas cloud’ has materialised at Birling Gap,” he says. “I thought, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ With all the fear around terrorism, you just don’t know. I spoke to someone at the hospital and they said, ‘People are coming in; we don’t know what it is.’ They were scrabbling around in the dark.” Sussex police, who coordinated the response on land, received the first call about the event at 5.08pm. It came not from a member of the public but from an officer who had been given the information by the RNLI. As the makeup of the cloud was unknown, and reports of symptoms were coming in from a wide area, a forward control point was set up just over a mile from Birling Gap, at the Beachy Head car park. Police, firefighters, ambulance crews and the coastguard convened. Within an hour the police had released a statement advising residents in the area to stay inside, with doors and windows closed. By 5.30pm, the coastguard and RNLI had started evacuating three miles of coastline between Birling Gap and Eastbourne. “By this time a lot of people had left the beach,” Knight remembers. “Then we saw the fire brigade arrive with full protective gear on – head to toe in masks, goggles – and everyone else was semi-naked. I started to really cough, I could feel it in my chest. My eyes were burning. Then of course the anxiety gets you. The children started seeing police officers and my son was really concerned about the animals, the sheep. He was saying, ‘What’s going to happen to all the farm animals, Mummy, is someone going to move them?’ Had it hit a busy beach like Brighton, it would have been a major, major incident.” At 6pm patients started arriving at Eastbourne hospital, not only from Birling Gap but also from the wider Eastbourne area. They were complaining of streaming eyes, coughing and sore throats; there had also been reports of vomiting. “We work on a 1-2-3 rule,” says chief operating officer Joe Chadwick-Bell. “If the first patient comes along: interesting. If somebody else comes along, you think something’s going on. If a third person comes along, it’s not a coincidence.” As more patients started to arrive, the A&amp;E department declared a major incident. A report published in January by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that the fire service deployed mobile gas detectors calibrated to locate carbon monoxide, oxygen, flammable gas and hydrogen sulphide – chemicals they might expect to encounter in the course of their more regular callouts. Only a very low reading was recorded for flammable gas and a single reading for ammonia at a level too low to be registered by humans. Furthermore, a police tactical adviser specialising in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats was called in to test the air, but again found nothing of concern. No samples were taken by any agency. As dusk fell, a queue had formed at the hospital, as patients were assessed by medics in fluorescent green hazmat suits and processed through a decontamination tent set up outside A&amp;E. At one point more than 80 people were queueing. Patients arrived throughout the night and into the next morning. On the advice of the National Poisons Information Service, 108 were showered, their clothes placed in a plastic bag, and issued with a hospital gown and slippers before proceeding to A&amp;E. Consultant Dr Zeki Atesli was on call that day. “The most common complaint was red eyes,” he says. “The poisons unit mentioned ammonia, but I didn’t smell any gas. We didn’t know what we were dealing with. One patient with acute exacerbation of asthma we took into resus as a precaution; another gentleman in his 70s with a history of angina developed chest pain. One girl collapsed in my arms from the anxiety. But no one was pushing or screaming. English people are very nice. They stay in the queue.” “You could taste it,” Chadwick-Bell says. “It was an acidy-type taste.” Hearing that the cloud was moving west, she contacted Eastbourne’s sister hospital at St Leonards-on-Sea in Hastings, 14 miles along the coast, which was put on alert for a major incident. “They had their tent out and they were ready to go.” Although only a few patients turned up in Hastings, the cloud had spread far beyond Birling Gap. Just over half a mile inland, people drinking in the garden of the Tiger Inn in East Dean were advised by police to evacuate, while sore throats and stinging eyes were experienced at a beer festival in Litlington, three miles north-west of Birling Gap. Tony Fitch, who has been fishing in the area for 65 years, spent the day on the beach at Pevensey Bay, nine miles east. He remembers a mist and a sea breeze from the south-east, and while he noticed nothing amiss at the time, the next morning he had a sore throat and sore eyes, symptoms he says have lingered to this day. *** Eastbourne’s new town slogan, launched in the summer of 2016, caused a stir: “Breathe It In” is a brave choice for a town recently ranked as one of Britain’s worst for air quality. Dr Gary Fuller of King’s College London, an expert in air pollution, works with the Sussex Air Quality Partnership, an organisation promoting better air quality in the county. He explains that two fixed monitors registered unusually high spikes of ozone late in the afternoon on 27 August, at around the time of the haze. “The peaks were exceptional,” he says. “This wasn’t just something confined to the beach at Birling Gap; it was covering a far wider area.” A monitor at Lullington Heath, five miles inland, and another in Eastbourne both recorded a rapid rise in the gas on the same afternoon. The abruptness of the peaks was unusual, however, and it’s possible the monitors were responding to another substance: chlorine, for instance, can affect ozone readings. “It didn’t behave as we would expect ozone to behave,” Fuller says. While no one appeared to have been made seriously ill, dozens of Stephen Lloyd’s constituents, who hours earlier had been sunbathing, found themselves standing naked in a decontamination shower. No one knows how many more experienced symptoms, but tens of thousands were advised to close their doors and windows and stay inside. Lloyd began pressing the agencies for information. “At the back of my mind I was thinking: suppose if someone had dropped dead. Surely someone’s going to tell me what it is. Where the hell did it come from? Everyone’s telling me it’s probably a boat cleaning its tanks. But not to worry, they said, the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency are checking it out.” According to a freedom of information request, Public Health England’s working hypothesis, revealed in an email sent to the Cabinet Office at 1am that night, was that “a tanker in the English Channel suffered a leakage of ammonia”, even though only small amounts had been detected at Birling Gap. As well as monitoring fuel emissions, the International Maritime Organization regulates the discharge of effluent and bilge water, chemical-cargo vapours, tank-cleaning chemicals and ballast-water disinfectants. Any of these, released deliberately or by accident, may have been to blame. Sawyer found two reports of a chemical tanker washing out its tanks on the edge of the fishing lanes that day, but the vessel was not identified. The coastguard received a report of a vessel discharging “odd-coloured exhaust” but it, too, has been ruled out as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. At the Sovereign Harbour lifeboat station, a live GPS screen shows all the vessels in the Channel. Looking out through the window, I can make out only two or three hazy ghosts of ships on the horizon, but the screen shows dozens – private yachts, trawlers, 30,000-tonne tankers, 150,000-tonne container ships – with their rate of knots and direction, and ports of origin and destination. Little can pass through the Channel unmonitored. Using techniques developed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986, the Met Office was able to trace the course of the plume in the hours before it reached Birling Gap. According to Defra, “The surface air had come over the sea from an easterly direction for the previous nine hours but before that the wind had been… from the west. This strongly suggests an offshore source in the northern part of the English Channel, and effectively rules out France or onshore sources in southern England.” But the timescale, the size of the area from which the substance could have come and the fact that it hadn’t been identified meant the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency was unable to narrow down the number of suspect vessels to fewer than 180, many of which were hundreds of miles away by the time the analysis was done. In Fuller’s experience, the event is unprecedented in Britain. The only incident that comes close occurred in 1997, when a tanker collision off Ostend, Belgium, sent a cloud of petrol vapour across central England, causing irritation to skin and eyes. But both the substance and its source were quickly identified. “We tend to focus on air pollution in towns,” he adds. “We forget there are big sources out there, just a few miles off the coast.” Professor John Sodeau, an expert in air pollution and atmospheric chemistry at University College Cork, believes the weather conditions on the day are crucial to understanding what happened. He suggests that sulphurous emissions from ships’ engines reacted with chlorine-containing substances used in the cleaning of ballast or cargo tanks, and the resulting gases and vapours accumulated in the sunny, windless conditions. As he puts it, “Throw the ingredients into a saucepan, bring to the boil, put on a lid and leave to simmer.” Such a “soup” could not only cause symptoms of the kind reported when blown ashore, but could result in the creation of compounds that might smell like burning plastic or chlorine, as well as raising ozone levels. But shipping waste was not the only theory. Two days after the event, the Twitter account of the NERC Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (Neodaas) posted an image recorded by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite at 10.56 on the morning of the cloud. It shows Birling Gap on the coast, and on the water, about five miles to the south-west, a slender plume of what looks like smoke. It is about two miles long and extends in a roughly easterly direction. No ship is visible. The following day, another Twitter user replied: “That is the position of the wreck of ww1 tanker Mira.” The SS Mira, a merchant oil tanker sunk by a mine in October 1917, lies 20 metres underwater at almost precisely the point from which the plume appears to originate. Could this have been the source? Ben Taylor of Neodaas, who posted the images, says the plume is not visible in satellite passes from the previous month, and first appears seven hours before people began to experience symptoms at Birling Gap. It was soon observed that the plume was heading in the wrong direction to have hit Birling Gap – east, rather than west with the wind. Taylor now believes it was not gas or vapour but underwater silt, disturbed by the shifting of the 100-year-old wreck and carried on currents. But as he says, “The timing is certainly strange.” For his part, Tony Fitch, who was fishing at Pevensey Bay that day, is convinced the cloud came from a French nuclear power station, more than 60 miles across the Channel. He has asked his GP to test him for the effects of radiation. It would not be the first time a substance carried on the air from France affected the region: people in Eastbourne and across southern England remember “Le Pong” of 2013, when an escape of methanethiol, a chemical used to add a warning odour to domestic gas, floated over from a chemical works in Rouen, 100 miles away. *** The diversity of public theories about the origin of the substance – chlorine gas leaking from a first world war wreck; an accident at an incinerator; some creation of a nearby offshore windfarm; a top-secret military psyop – is inevitable, given that the substance remains officially unidentified eight months later. It was for this reason, too, that the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency aborted its investigation in late September. “They told me all the way through,” says Stephen Lloyd MP, “‘Don’t worry, we’ve identified the ships that were in the area, but we have to wait till they port before we check it out.’ But then six weeks later I hear: ‘No, we’re not doing it, there’s no point, because we don’t know what it is.’ It is criminally wrong that this country and our emergency services don’t have the kit that can store, assess and measure what the hell this was.” Lloyd is not alone in pressing for more information. Green party MEP Keith Taylor has asked Defra whether the incident was reported to the European Commission. The Seveso directive states a report must be made by an EU member country if more than 500 people are “evacuated or confined” for over two hours as a result of an accident involving a dangerous substance. He believes the event meets these criteria, but the commission can find no record of such a report being made, and Defra has not responded to requests for clarification. “It is hard to escape the feeling that the government has consistently shrugged its shoulders in response to this incident,” Taylor says. He also highlights a second incident, four miles along the coast exactly two months later. On the night of 27 October, a stench of burning plastic was reported by residents of Seaford, along with burning eyes and nausea. Although the council attributed the odour to nearby agricultural activity, residents wondered if there was a connection to the more serious event that summer. Defra’s scientific report into the incident, released in January, concludes that, while a ship remains the most likely culprit, “unless further information is obtained, it may never be possible to identify the precise source of the release”. “If one old person or one baby had died because of this gas,” Lloyd says, “and no one knew what it was, my God, there would have been resignations of chief executives and secretaries of state.” In December, Defra announced a review of the emergency response which, among other issues, will investigate “the practicalities of taking, storing and analysing gas samples in future events of this kind”. But the experts have their doubts. “You do not just collect the air in a bell jar and take it home for later analysis,” says air pollution specialist John Sodeau. “Samples have to be collected on site and analysed in real time. The levels may be parts per trillion or billion and the chemical radicals involved may last for only seconds.” Defra’s review is ongoing. It has no plans to make its findings public. For Eastbourne district general hospital, the event was a valuable learning exercise. Dr Atesli has been asked to speak about it at medical conferences. “You don’t expect something like this in Eastbourne,” he says. “But it can happen.” Laura Knight, whose cough lasted for two weeks, still hopes for answers. “It’s really concerning,” she says. “I don’t know if there’s something in my body, and nobody else knows either.” On my last visit, Birling Gap was busy with visitors enjoying the midwinter sun. The only haze was from the waves crashing on the chalk foreshore, the only masks worn by a few Japanese tourists making their way across the car park. On the horizon, the world’s ships plied back and forth. • William Atkins’ The Immeasurable World: Journeys In Desert Places will be published in June. Commenting on this piece?

National Grid, which operates the UK’s electricity network, said small power generators had bid for 15-year contracts starting in 2020-21, as part of the government’s capacity market reforms. The contracts, for firms that produce below 100MW, will see them paid to be on standby in case of a shortfall from power sources such as coal, gas or wind. Of the total 8.7GW of back-up power that firms have offered, 3.9GW – more than the generating capacity of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station – is from generators who say they will burn either gas or diesel. The companies could make up to £787m between them, depending on how many opt for diesel over gas and how many are successful in the final auction in December. Diesel power firms submitted bids to provide just 0.87GW in last year’s auction, winning about three-quarters of their bids, worth some £176m. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy said it was unable to provide an exact figure for how much diesel generation had been bid for, although insiders said the true figure could be lower than 3.9GW. But a spokesman said that even though diesel firms could be paid millions to be on standby, they were unlikely to contribute much to pollution because they would only run when there was a heightened risk of power shortages. “Diesel generation accounts for less than 0.1% of total energy generation and will only ever be used for very short periods of time to provide instant electricity when it is needed. “We are taking action on diesel emissions and all new diesel systems will have to comply with new emission controls,” the spokesman said. A spokesman for climate change campaign group Sandbag said: “We are surprised and disappointed that so much new diesel could be built. “There’s a risk we’re sleepwalking into a new generation of polluting diesel farms unless the government gets a grip on this. We need the right type of investment to help modernise our electricity system, and that certainly isn’t diesel. “The government needs to ensure that the capacity auction is incentivising the right investment, rather than building a nationwide fleet of dirty diesel.” Richard Black, director of thinktank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the government should be doing more to encourage the use of battery storage and demand-side response, where firms agree to reduce or shift their energy usage. “The capacity market is a necessary tool but it would be very sensible to design it so that it also fits in with the long-term objective of building a smart low-carbon system and fulfilling its aim of the UK becoming a world leader on battery technology,” Black said. “They’ve missed a trick. They could have rewritten the rules and redesigned the capacity mechanism, they could have differentiated between clean and dirty energy and they chose not to. “If they’d rewritten the rules to prioritise batteries and demand-side response then we might have more of those technologies available now.” A spokesperson for Greenpeace said: “Britain is one of the world’s leading economies and the idea that in the 21st century we may have to rely on highly polluting diesel farms to keep the lights on is quite embarrassing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jan/23/theresa-may-brexit-industrial-strategy-government","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-23T19:38:00Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's post-Brexit industrial strategy ducks tough decisions | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jan/23/theresa-may-brexit-industrial-strategy-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jan/23/theresa-may-brexit-industrial-strategy-government","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's post-Brexit industrial strategy ducks tough decisions","bodyText":"Hurrah, the UK will embark on its post-Brexit adventure with an industrial strategy, or at least a government that is prepared to use the term without embarrassment. What’s more, the business secretary, Greg Clark, hit some of the right notes in his introduction to the green paper. The goal is not to pick winners, which would be to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s. Nor is it to protect the position of incumbents. It’s about “creating the right conditions for new and growing enterprises to thrive”. Few could disagree with the sentiment, or the eagerness to see the benefits of self-improvement spread more evenly across the nation. Jolly good, but defining the ambition and describing past errors is the easy bit. It would be hard to conclude that the government’s thinking amounts to a clear-headed plan that is ready to be put into action. Many tough decisions were ducked in the green paper, or left hanging in the air. Should the steel industry celebrate a “strategic approach” to procurement? Talk of mimicking Crossrail’s consideration of “social and economic factors” could suggest that British steel will be preferred in mega-projects like HS2. But the document didn’t say so explicitly. Many of the passages on procurements were about stirring innovation and encouraging small businesses. Steel may not be as exciting as life sciences and clean cars, but is it inside or outside the strategic tent? The UK Steel lobbying group was right to reflect that “much still needs to be done” to agree one of the vaunted “sector deals” with government. Or look at digital infrastructure, where the UK is ahead of major competitors on fast broadband but woefully behind the likes of Spain, South Korea and even Turkey on ultrafast capacity, the digital-to-the-premises (DTTP) variety. Does Clark agree with Vodafone that BT’s performance in delivering DTTP is “a national embarrassment”? Or does he think regulator Ofcom’s attempt to stir investment by opening up access to BT’s ducts and poles will suffice? Those questions lie at the heart of one critical debate about the UK’s digital future, but it’s not addressed. Instead, as in many areas, the green paper merely repeated commitments that have been made already – in this case the £740m going to support the roll-out of fibre broadband and 5G mobile technology. One suspects a serious government-backed commitment to DTTP would be counted in the billions or involve breaking up BT. In other words, the subject is too tricky for this document. Some industrialists will find to much to cheer, notably the emphasis on reducing energy costs (though it remains a mystery how that squares with the grotesquely expensive Hinkley Point C nuclear power station). Overall, though, one is left with a sense that the green paper amounts to a long list of good intentions without a clear sense of which should be preferred in a world of finite financial resources. Are we going down the American route (led by procurement and universities) or the German (with its emphasis on research and development) or the French (build some grands projets)? There were elements of all three. That may be a good thing, or it may be a muddle. The white paper needs to be sharper. Sainsbury’s should take the heat over boss’s barn If you were a shareholder in a FTSE 100 company, would you expect to be told that your chairman had been censured by the board after an internal investigation? Would you want to know there had been “material breaches” of policies covering conflicts of interest? The answer to both questions is surely yes. The chairman is supposed to be a guardian of good behaviour. If he or she has messed up – intentionally or not – it’s important to say. The tale of David Tyler, the Sainsbury’s chairman, and his barn conversion was told in Monday’s paper. In short: Tyler used one of Sainsbury’s green energy and engineering experts to inspect his plans to install underfloor heating at his home in East Sussex. One of the supermarket group’s building contractors then developed an action plan for free; and two other Sainsbury’s suppliers were contacted for specialist advice. Tyler then contacted Sainsbury’s company secretary to arrange compensation for use of employees’ time. He ended up paying £5,000 to charity and did not benefit financially. But the resulting investigation, conducted by two non-executive directors, concluded that “he received (paid for) services from an expert supplier due to his position that he would otherwise not have been able to”. Thus the official warning. It’s not the biggest scandal in the world, and Tyler’s failure to follow the rules was accepted as unintentional. But the intriguing detail is that it all happened in 2013. Sainsbury’s didn’t think it worth mentioning to shareholders, even in the years when its annual report scrupulously addressed the motor-racing sponsorship deals that some suppliers gave to the son of Justin King, chief executive at the time. That looks like double standards. Better late than never, Sainsbury’s could correct its oversight in this year’s annual report, lest anyone should think the publication, like Tyler’s country pad, is full of hot air."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jan/03/trump-says-us-safe-from-north-korean-nuclear-strike-no-thanks-to-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-03T11:43:23Z","webTitle":"Trump says US safe from North Korean nuclear strike – no thanks to China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/trump-says-us-safe-from-north-korean-nuclear-strike-no-thanks-to-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jan/03/trump-says-us-safe-from-north-korean-nuclear-strike-no-thanks-to-china","fields":{"headline":"Trump says US safe from North Korean nuclear strike – no thanks to China","bodyText":"Donald Trump has said no North Korean nuclear bomb will reach the US mainland, a day after the regime in Pyongyang claimed it was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The president-elect – who has yet to articulate his incoming administration’s approach to North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme – also took another swipe at China, accusing Beijing of failing to rein in the North’s nuclear ambitions. “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US. It won’t happen!” Trump tweeted. It was not clear what Trump meant: whether he believed North Korea was incapable of developing a reliable ICBM, or that the US would prevent it doing so. He went on to reignite his verbal tit-for-tat with Beijing, this time linking trade to what he called China’s unwillingness to exert pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the US in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” In a televised new year’s address, the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, appeared to put pressure on Trump ahead of his 20 January inauguration by claiming the regime was preparing to test-fire an ICBM. “We are in the final stages of test-launching the intercontinental ballistic missile,” he said, adding that the North had “soared as a nuclear power” after a year in which he oversaw two nuclear tests and the test-firing of around 20 ballistic missiles. Kim said his country had become a “military power of the east that cannot be touched by even the strongest enemy”. While Kim did not refer to Trump, he called on Washington to make a “resolute decision to withdraw its anachronistic hostile North Korea policy”. Kim’s comments fuelled speculation that Pyongyang will test a long-range missile to coincide with his birthday on 8 January, or around the time of Trump’s inauguration, in an attempt to ratchet up the pressure ahead of any negotiations with Washington. Since winning the US presidential election, Trump has not indicated he will abandon the Obama administration’s policy of isolating North Korea. He has described Kim as a “maniac”, but suggested in June 2015 that he would be willing to invite Kim to Washington for talks over hamburgers. North Korea is thought to be some way off developing a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the US, but some experts said Kim’s ICBM claims should be taken seriously, citing the progress that has been made since he became leader in late 2011. A fully functional North Korean ICBM could, in theory, reach the US mainland about 5,500 miles way (9,000km). North Korea has never successfully test-fired an ICBM but, according to Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California, it has made significant progress in developing the technology. “The bottom line is Pyongyang is much further along in their missile development than most people realise,” Hanham said, citing an April test on a large liquid-fuelled engine that could propel an ICBM. “The liquid engine test was astounding. For years we knew that North Korea had a Soviet R-27 missile engine design. They re-engineered the design of that engine to double its propulsion.” North Korea has said it is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile, but its claims to be able to miniaturise a nuclear device have been greeted with widespread scepticism. Kim has presided over three nuclear tests and several rocket launches in defiance of UN resolutions and despite multilateral sanctions designed to impair its ability to develop weapons of mass destruction. Hanham said 2016 “marked the year North Korea truly ramped up their WMD programme”, adding: “I think we’re going to see a [ICBM] flight test in 2017.” China brushed off suggestions it had done little to diffuse tensions created by North Korea’s nuclear program, stating its official position of supporting denuclearisation through peace talks. “We hope that all parties will refrain from words and deeds that lead to the escalation of tension in the situation,” said Geng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. “We hope to jointly push for an early return to dialogue and negotiation on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.” Beijing is North Korea’s biggest aid donor and only ally, yet has failed to persuade Kim to abandon his quest to turn North Korea into a legitimate nuclear state. Though irritated by Kim’s determination to defy UN resolutions on nuclear weapons, China does not want the North Korean regime to collapse, fearing that it would result in a united Korea with tens of thousands of South Korean and US troops ranged along the border it now shares with North Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2016/dec/16/edf-cut-gas-prices-hike-electricity-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-16T11:21:05Z","webTitle":"EDF to hike electricity prices 8.4% with other providers expected to follow suit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/16/edf-cut-gas-prices-hike-electricity-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2016/dec/16/edf-cut-gas-prices-hike-electricity-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"EDF to hike electricity prices 8.4% with other providers expected to follow suit","bodyText":"Householders face steep hikes in electricity bills next year, as EDF Energy said it would raise prices by 8.4% from March, with other “big six” energy providers expected to match the increases. The French-owned energy giant, which in September signed an £18bn deal to build the controversial Hinkley Point nuclear plant, said it would cut gas prices by 5.2% but blamed rising costs for the increase in its electricity tariff. Experts urged customers on standard tariffs to lock into cheap fixed-priced deals while they were still available. The changes mean that dual fuel customers with EDF (taking both electricity and gas) will see their bills rise by 1.2%, to an average of £1,082 a year. Prepayment customers who take both gas and electricity from EDF will still pay 5.1% less after March, at £1,081 a year. Wholesale energy prices have risen by around a third since last spring, and Mark Todd, co-founder of Energyhelpline, said EDF’s rise is likely to be “the first of many”. It is also the first major price rise since the collapse of GB Energy in November. The three-year-old gas and power supplier, which pulled in 160,000 customers with cheaper tariffs, blamed “swift and significant increases in energy prices” for its failure. Fears are now growing that other “challenger” providers could fail, and leave the big six in a stronger position to raise prices. Todd is predicting average rises nearer to 5%. “We urge consumers to take this as proof that price rises are definitely coming and to use it as a catalyst to get off the horrible standard tariffs that make so many cold and penniless, and get onto a nice low-cost fixed rate that makes heating your home affordable,” he added. EDF said that 1.5 million customers would be unaffected because they are locked into fixed-rate deals. It said it would write to those on standard variable tariffs and provide details of its best deals. Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF Energy, said: “Many industry commentators have said that prices charged by energy suppliers will rise after the winter. We are being open about the fact our electricity prices will go up after our price freeze. But we also know it is right to pass on to loyal customers the fall in gas costs that energy suppliers have seen over recent months.” But critics said EDF was raising electricity prices when much of its power was already generated from nuclear plants. “EDF is in the unique position of owning all the UK’s nuclear power stations so they don’t actually need to buy any electricity. This means that they have been largely insulated from the turmoil in the wholesale markets that has seen 35% wholesale price rises since March and put GB Energy out of business. These wholesale rises are putting much more pressure on other suppliers to hike rates than EDF,” said Todd. onsumers. EDF is first of the big six to announce that an increase in prices is in the pipeline. British Gas and SSE have both frozen the cost of their standard tariffs over the winter months. Claire Osborne, energy expert at uSwitch, said: “It’s disappointing to see EDF already committing to price rises in March that will make them the most expensive variable tariff of the big six. Increasing the price of an already high energy bill could leave almost 2 million EDF standard variable customers buckling under the pressure, and it’s a bitter pill to swallow even if it is after the winter months – consumers still need to keep the lights on. “With wholesale costs rising, putting further pressure on bills, we have already seen the cheapest deal rise by £126 in the past two months, and the danger is now that the other big six suppliers will follow suit with their own price hikes in the spring.” However Guy Anker, managing editor of Moneysavingexpert, said the price rise was lower than expected given what is happening to wholesale prices. “Nevertheless, no one should see this as good news and it should sound as a loud clarion call to any customer of any energy firm on a standard tariff to urgently check if they can save by locking into a cheap fix, as other firms are likely to follow.” He added: “Urgent is the key word as the price of the cheapest deals has been rising, so the longer you wait the less you’ll save if that trend continues.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/19/scotland-sets-ambitious-goal-of-66-emissions-cut-within-15-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-19T14:46:30Z","webTitle":"Scotland sets ambitious goal of 66% emissions cut within 15 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/scotland-sets-ambitious-goal-of-66-emissions-cut-within-15-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/19/scotland-sets-ambitious-goal-of-66-emissions-cut-within-15-years","fields":{"headline":"Scotland sets ambitious goal of 66% emissions cut within 15 years","bodyText":"Scotland is seeking to dramatically cut its reliance on fossil fuels for cars, energy and homes after setting a radical target to cut total climate emissions by 66% within 15 years. In one of the world’s most ambitious climate strategies, ministers in Edinburgh have unveiled far tougher targets to increase the use of ultra-low-carbon cars, green electricity and green home heating by 2032. The Scottish government has set the far higher target after its original goal of cutting Scotland’s emissions by 42% by 2020 was met six years early – partly because climate change has seen winters which are warmer than normal, cutting emissions for home heating. The new strategy, which is expected to cost up to £3bn a year to implement and is closely linked to a new renewable energy programme due to be published this month, will call for: • 40% of all new cars and vans sold in Scotland to be ultra-low-emission by 2032, with 50% of Scotland’s buses to be low-carbon. • A totally carbon-free electricity sector based entirely on renewable energy sources by 2032, when Scotland’s last nuclear power station will close. • Four out of five of Scotland’s 2m homes to be heated using low-carbon technologies. • The repairing of 250,000 hectares of degraded peatlands, which store a total of 1.7 gigatonnes of CO2 in Scotland. • At least 30% of Scotland’s vital publicly owned ferry fleet to be low-carbon, powered by hybrid engines. Enriched by a vast £727bn sovereign wealth fund built up from its North Sea oil and gas industries, Norway has set Europe’s most ambitious emissions reduction target so far, committing itself to become carbon neutral by 2030 – two decades earlier than planned. But that target, a cut equal to 53m tonnes of carbon equivalent, will rely very heavily on carbon trading: paying other countries to cut their emissions more deeply or buying carbon credits from industries which are cutting emissions. Scotland’s 66% target, on the other hand, will be based on real-terms cuts in domestic emissions, although ministers admit there are serious policy and financial challenges raised by the UK’s decision to quit the EU. Nor does the strategy include Scotland’s substantial offshore oil and gas industry, or its oil exports, only covering onshore emissions. The Scottish environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, told MSPs at Holyrood on Thursday that the proposals “represent a new level of ambition which will help maintain Scotland’s reputation as a climate leader within the international community”. But Cunningham said that Scottish businesses, homeowners and commuters – whom ministers privately see as too reluctant to change their behaviour – now had to take a far greater share of the burden. Until now, a large proportion of Scotland’s decline in CO2 emissions has been driven by the sharp shift to renewable energy from windfarms, an EU-wide move away from coal-powered energy, EU emissions trading and worldwide technical advances, particularly on car engine efficiency. Scottish drivers will now be asked to quickly start taking up electrically powered or hybrid cars; homeowners will be encouraged to strip out gas-fired boilers at home and improve insulation; farmers will be asked to cut the methane and nitrogen climate gases, and Network Rail will be paid to electrify 35% of Scotland’s rail network. Richard Dixon, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said he applauded the government’s ambition, but it still overlooked substantial issues, particularly an economic strategy wedded to roads and aviation. The Scottish government wants to abolish air passenger duty to increase flying in a bid to stimulate growth. “It paints a very good vision of what a low-carbon Scotland could look like in 2032,” he said. “But there are clearly areas where there has been resistance and policies either aren’t going far enough or aren’t credible.” Ministers should put far greater stress on forcing motorists out of their cars and on to far more energy-efficient public transport or bicycles, Dixon said. Farmers should be forced to accept compulsory testing for overuse of climate-damaging fertilisers. There had to be far tougher standards on home energy efficiency. The 2032 target will include legally binding annual targets first agreed by the Scottish parliament in 2009. Officials estimate that hitting that goal will cost annually about 2% of Scotland’s GDP, which is worth about £147bn a year. More offshore windfarms and marine energy plants will be needed, as will hundreds of thousands of electrical car charging points, alongside the cost of more than 1m new home heating systems. But ministers believe that improving air quality, cutting fuel poverty, increasing home insulation, and reducing road accidents through less use of cars will save public money by cutting NHS spending and early deaths, as well as boosting economic output. They worry about the impact the UK’s departure from the EU will have on continuing pan-European funding and investment in the low-carbon economy, and the EU emissions trading regime, which plays a large part in reducing emissions. The current EU emissions targets are a 40% cut by 2030, while the UK government’s goal is to cut emissions by 50% by 2025, with an 80% target set for 2050. Officials have previously acknowledged that policies and industries under the Scottish government’s control cover about 30% of Scotland’s overall emissions; the remainder is influenced or controlled at UK and EU level, and international industries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/04/solar-outstrips-coal-in-past-six-months-of-uk-electricity-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-04T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Solar outstrips coal in past six months of UK electricity generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/04/solar-outstrips-coal-in-past-six-months-of-uk-electricity-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/04/solar-outstrips-coal-in-past-six-months-of-uk-electricity-generation","fields":{"headline":"Solar outstrips coal in past six months of UK electricity generation","bodyText":"Electricity generated by solar panels on fields and homes outstripped Britain’s ageing coal power stations over the past six months in a historic first. Climate change analysts Carbon Brief found more electricity came from the sun than coal from April to the end of September, in a report that highlighted the two technologies’ changing fortunes. Solar had already eclipsed coal for a day in April and then for the whole month of May, with coal providing zero power for the first time in more than 100 years for several days in May. The latest milestone saw an estimated 6,964 gigawatt hours (GWh) generated by solar over the half-year, or 5.4% of the UK’s electricity demand. Coal produced 6,342GWh, or 4.7%. The trend will not continue into winter because of solar’s seasonal nature, but the symbolic records reveal the dramatic impacts solar subsidies and environmental penalties for coal have wrought. Increases in the carbon floor price last year have driven three major coal power plants - Longannet, Ferrybridge C and Rugeley – to close earlier this year. That came on top of a similar amount of coal power being closed between 2012 and 2014 because upgrading the stations to meet higher air pollution standards was deemed uneconomic. A fourth coal plant, Eggborough near Selby in North Yorkshire, was expected to close in February but won a reprieve after it signed a 12-month contract to provide backup capacity to the grid. But the power station’s future after that contract is unclear, and its owners are now consulting on whether to demolish it and build a gas-fired one in its place. According to trade body Energy UK, there are 10 coal power plants left in the UK. One is currently closed for conversion to biomass, one only operates in winter and another (Eggborough) only provides reserve power when needed. Solar has grown rapidly in the last six years, though figures published last week by the Office for National Statistics showed installations had crashed after the government came to power and cut the industry’s subsidies. A spokeswoman for the Solar Trade Association (STA) said: “This is a valuable milestone on the road to renewables overtaking fossil fuels. It is a testament to just how effective the British solar industry has been at installing clean and reliable power and at bringing down costs.” The government said last week that solar power could produce electricity more cheaply than the price agreed for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, but officials suggested solar would have additional costs for the National Grid. But a new report for the STA, published on Tuesday, concluded that integrating many more solar panels into the grid would not add excessive costs to accommodate the fact the sun doesn’t always shine and backup power is required to cover solar. “With intermittency costs today of around £1.3/MWh for solar [with around 10-12GW of solar installed], increasing to £6.8/MWh with a substantial 40GW of solar on the system by 2030, we would suggest these costs do not provide a strong argument against the further build out of renewable generation,” said the report, by the consultancy Aurora."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/23/jim-oneill-is-just-the-latest-business-leader-to-have-his-fill-of-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-23T14:13:35Z","webTitle":"Jim O'Neill is just the latest business leader to have his fill of politics | Larry Elliot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/23/jim-oneill-is-just-the-latest-business-leader-to-have-his-fill-of-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/23/jim-oneill-is-just-the-latest-business-leader-to-have-his-fill-of-politics","fields":{"headline":"Jim O'Neill is just the latest business leader to have his fill of politics","bodyText":"Jim O’Neill’s abrupt, if hardly unexpected, resignation from Theresa May’s Treasury team is merely the latest example of how the marriage of business and politics can be a rocky affair that ends in divorce. Prime ministers and chancellors often see the attraction of inviting big hitters from the world of commerce to join their administrations. Gordon Brown made Digby Jones, the former head of the CBI, a member of his government of all the talents. Archie Norman was the boss of Asda when he was invited to apply for the safe Conservative seat of Tunbridge Wells at the 1997 election. Neither especially enjoyed the experience. It was George Osborne rather than David Cameron who wooed O’Neill away from Goldman Sachs. The diehard Manchester United fan ticked all the right boxes. He was the perfect fit to help with two of Osborne’s pet projects: the “northern powerhouse” and developing closer economic ties between Britain and China. O’Neill made his name by identifying the rise of four leading emerging market economies - Brazil, Russia, India and China - as a key feature of the global economy, giving them the title Brics. Like Osborne, he was convinced that the rise of China would be as significant as the emergence of the US as a global economic superpower in the 20th century. Both men thought Britain’s best long-term interests were served in forging close and harmonious links with Beijing. In his resignation letter to the prime minister, O’Neill said the case for the northern powerhouse and closer links with the leading emerging economies was “even stronger following the referendum, and I am pleased that, despite speculation to the contrary, both appear to be commanding your personal attention”. This is hardly a full-throated endorsement and will do little to quell speculation that O’Neill was unhappy about the review May insisted upon before agreeing to go-ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant earlier this month, and that he suspects plans are afoot to dilute the northern powerhouse project. The announcement that he has resigned the Conservative whip and will sit as a crossbench peer merely adds to the sense that he is the latest business leader to become disillusioned with Westminster politics. Much has changed in the past three months. It is not just that the Brexit vote led to Cameron’s resignation. Starting with Osborne’s brutal sacking, May has been systematically removing traces of the former regime. Her support for grammar schools irked the comprehensively educated O’Neill. Put simply, he had a choice. He could stick around in a government he felt increasingly at odds with, or go off and do something else more rewarding. Given that O’Neill cares more about José Mourinho than he does about Theresa May, the decision probably didn’t take all that long. Nor is it one he is likely to regret."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/feb/26/windfarms-arent-real-reason-energy-bills-rising-blame-free-market","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-26T07:00:23Z","webTitle":"Windfarms aren’t the real reason energy bills are rising.

Blame the free market","bodyText":"Last week, photographs of wind turbines were once again juxtaposed with headlines about rising energy prices. The cause on this occasion was no less pre-eminent a body than a Lords committee, comprising former chancellor Norman Lamont and other heavyweight peers. “To reduce carbon emissions, governments have subsidised renewables, passing on the cost to consumers in their electricity bills. The average domestic electricity bill was 58% higher in 2016 than it was in 2003,” the economic affairs committee said in its report on energy policy. Anyone reading it would have been forgiven for directing their anger at windfarms when increases in their energy bills land, as half of the big six energy suppliers are planning. Yet the peers’ report admits that “rising international prices for fossil fuels” were the main driver for energy bills going up over the period. Renewable energy subsidies on bills – the “green crap”, as former PM David Cameron reportedly called them – do add a cost. But it’s small, at 10% of an average dual-fuel bill, as the peers themselves note. The blame for the latest round of price rises announced by energy suppliers, big and small, does not lie primarily with wind turbines and solar panels. Energy regulator Ofgem was clear about that in front of MPs last week and in its analysis last month. Even First Utility, one of the so-called challenger suppliers meant to be bringing down prices, said on Friday it was raising annual bills by £105.60 for 117,000 of its 900,000 customers from 1 April. Wholesale electricity and gas prices were up 42% year on year, it said, while the cost of renewable subsidies was up 25%. Yet there is no sign ministers want to get involved in the messy business of capping prices, which some are calling for. Theresa May and business secretary Greg Clark have both expressed concern for billpayers. But as Iain Conn, the chief executive of British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, said last week when his company reported a 4% rise in profits: “The government aren’t sure they need to intervene.” So where does that leave efforts to protect householders and industry from rising energy bills? Policies to improve energy efficiency – the boring but important business of installing wall insulation and fitting new boilers to bring down bills – have been axed or left on a dusty shelf in Whitehall. The government has no power to manage wholesale electricity and gas prices, inside or out of the EU. We are, as one energy industry chief said recently, “overexposed to global markets over which we have no control”. Which leaves us with nuclear power and renewables as tools to insulate Britain from the whims of wholesale fossil fuel prices. Nuclear is good at providing a lot of power; Hinkley Point C and Moorside in Cumbria, two of the hoped-for arrivals in a fleet of new atomic plants, would alone provide some 14% of the UK’s electricity. But new nuclear is not cheap and it is not guaranteed to happen. “Most of our witnesses disagreed that the [Hinkley] project provided value for money,” said the Lords economic affairs committee. Its chair, Lord Hollick, believes that the economic justifications for Moorside and Hinkley are hanging in the balance. So we come back to the “green crap”. At some point the political narrative and public discourse needs to turn 180 degrees: from blaming renewables for rising energy prices to viewing renewables as our saviour from them. The cost of solar power has dropped 80% in the last five years, according to the leading energy authority, the International Energy Agency. Even offshore wind, the priciest renewable source, has come down by a third in the past three years. Yes, these things add costs to managing the power grid. But as an authoritative report found last week, they’ll be modest even if use of renewables such as wind and solar doubles from 15% today to 30%. Hopefully, by that point, the headline next to the windfarm photo will tell a different story. Rightmove’s hold on internet house adverts looks rock solid Everyone appears to be winning from the housing market apart from the people actually buying or renting a property. Bovis Homes last week announced that it was having to pay out £7m to customers who had moved into shoddy homes, but it still managed to increase revenues by 11% to more than £1bn. However, it was Rightmove’s numbers that really caught the eye. The online property portal reported 2016 revenues up 15% to £220m – and pre-tax profits up nearly a fifth to £162m. That is a margin of 74%. By contrast, Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, made the same pre-tax profit last year – on sales of more than £48bn. Extraordinarily, Britons spent nearly one billion minutes every month looking at property on the website last year. That is some 15 minutes per person, including large swaths of the population who are just dreaming – with no plan to buy or rent a house. Rightmove has built a hugely dominant position in the housing market. One million residential properties are now advertised on the site – a third more than any rival. Its profit margin is unsurprising given what Rightmove actually does – it just runs a website used by estate agents to advertise the homes on their books. It is the equivalent of owning the only big shopping centre in Britain, where each shop pays rent and also pays for its own maintenance and security. Every shopper in the land visits the centre, because it has all the shops, and every shop wants to be there because everyone goes there. Advertisers – mainly estate agents – paid an average of £842 per month last year to get on Rightmove. That was up 12% year-on-year. But, according to analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown, it is still a bargain for the agents – because it is a third of what they were paying a decade ago on local press advertising to get a fraction of the Rightmove audience. Usually when margins are so high it is an open invitation for new competition to set up. But Rightmove is so entrenched it is currently hard to see what might dislodge it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/14/brexit-fanatics-eu-negotiations-reckless-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-14T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"The Brexit fanatics are at the helm, but don’t despair - this is not over | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/14/brexit-fanatics-eu-negotiations-reckless-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/14/brexit-fanatics-eu-negotiations-reckless-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"The Brexit fanatics are at the helm, but don’t despair - this is not over","bodyText":"That’s it; the way is clear for Theresa May to plunge the country into a self-destructive journey into thickets of the unknown. This will be her legacy, her hand the one that risked breaking the economy and breaking the United Kingdom too. Look what’s been unleashed. Nicola Sturgeon leaps at the chance, making a hard border along a new Hadrian’s wall a frightening possibility, along with a Trump-fence across Ireland, or Northern Ireland gone altogether. What a curious confrontation to hear May and Sturgeon each accuse the other of reckless folly in wrenching their country away from their biggest markets: both are right. May likes regal comparisons – and Bloody Mary she may be if, through inept intransigence, Edinburgh ends up carved on her heart, with nothing left but a bereft little England, Wales limping alongside, cutting a bedraggled figure in the world. The country voted to leave, but she had choices: she may yet be devoured by the hard Brexit tiger she has chosen to ride. She could have taken a softer, more pragmatic path of moderation, compromise and neighbourliness, mindful of her country’s other 48%. The letter she sends to sever our 44-year alliance could open in a spirit of generosity by welcoming our existing European Union citizens, but instead she sets out grim-faced, ungiving. She has handed the helm to the wreckers, on a fanatics’ mission that will allow no swerving to avoid the rocks. Only the hardest of Brexits will do, yet even that’s not enough for these insatiables. Battle-hardened revolutionaries who have fought this eccentric cause for decades can’t lay down their guns, even though they won: the likes of Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood and Liam Fox can only do politics as guerrilla fighters. Parliament voted this week, but with no mandate for hard Brexit – out of the single market and customs union, with immigration May’s priority. As the going gets tough, voters might recall how often Brexiteers such as Daniel Hannan said: “Absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market.” Take a look at the Tory manifesto, committed to the single market. That’s why Michael Heseltine is right to say: “The fightback starts here,” after his sacking displayed the worst of May’s small-minded limitations. “Who can say,” Heseltine writes, “how people will respond when negotiations with Europe lay bare harsh realities, supplanting the shamelessly false prospectus on which the leavers won the referendum?” Ask psephologist Professor John Curtice, and he says voters may indeed change their minds if the bad consequences of leaving become apparent in a drip-drip of closing factories, emptying City glass towers, a flight of jobs. But, he adds, that all depends on who gets to frame the story: “If the EU is seen as playing hard ball there may be a Pavlovian reaction so leavers feel their choice was justified: they never took the EU to their hearts.” But May is at risk, he says, if she can’t deliver a promised good deal on trade without freedom of movement. The “framers”, as usual, will be the Mail, the Sun, Express and Telegraph, pouncing on any compromise, blaming foreigners who, not unreasonably, say a Brexit deal must be worse than Britain staying in. Monday’s Daily Mail, ahead of the Lords’ reprised debate, issued a typically thuggish threat across its front page: “Cover-up over ‘dodgy’ payouts to peers.” Vote the wrong way, and we’ll dig out your attendance expenses. That’s how it will be every step of the way with these true “enemies of the people”. Theresa May, who apparently never knowingly opposes the will of the Mail, will surely give way every time. Indeed, it might save a lot of time if she simply asked Paul Dacre and Rupert Murdoch what, if any, compromises they will stomach to get a deal, and do what they say. Will they or the Brexit madmen compromise on anything at all? She starts out badly by refusing the modest request for a meaningful parliamentary vote at the end, deal or no deal. Boris Johnson’s throwaway line that it would be “perfectly OK” to fall back on WTO terms shows how far they have vanished into Neverland. A deliberate “no deal” may be all the fanatics will now accept. Heseltine is right to live in hope when everything is in flux. The German parliament is just passing a five-year ban on all benefits for non-German EU citizens. Had Cameron come home with that, the referendum might have swung the other way. Observers suggest his obnoxious sabre-rattling to pacify his Brexiteers guaranteed he got almost nothing. If only May looked set to approach these negotiations in a better frame of mind. But that’s never been the British way, and the horrible history of arrogant Albion will tell against us. Thatcher’s handbag swung at them. Blair always brandished “red lines” before summits, making not one pro-Europe speech in this country. In 2007 Brown went to comical lengths to avoid being seen signing the Lisbon treaty, sneaking in late behind closed doors. The pro-remain letter Tory MPs sent out to constituents had five entirely negative bullet points: “No euro … we stayed out of Schengen … we secured opt-outs … we have an emergency brake on in-work benefits …we got the EU to cut red tape.” Not since Edward Heath (a useless communicator) did any leader hymn praise to the EU’s peace and fraternity between close cultures with shared values in a threatening world. Don’t imagine it’s all over. It’s hardly begun. Ahead lies the so-called great reform bill, re-homing EU laws, which must be done by Brexit-day in two years. Watch the fanatics battle to strip out every regulation they can – on food, environment, work, banking, safe medicines, nuclear power, cyberfraud, everything that touches daily lives. Watch the zealots’ culture wars aim for no rules, no taxes and wild west Trumpish “freedoms”. But they may over-reach, and turn the tide against themselves. Jean-Claude Juncker gently hopes one day we might return. Guy Verhofstadt hopes we can keep our valued EU citizenship. On past form we may test the EU’s patience to the utmost – but if they can restrain retaliation and remember the other 48% of us, they could persuade enough leavers to change their minds before it’s too late. Despite everything, this is no time to despair. Be there on 25 March, marching to celebrate the EU’s 60th anniversary, keeping spirits up, because all is not lost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/nov/01/jellyfish-tampons-diapers-hydromash-environment-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-01T14:41:26Z","webTitle":"This startup is using jellyfish to make eco-friendly tampons, diapers and pads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/01/jellyfish-tampons-diapers-hydromash-environment-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/01/jellyfish-tampons-diapers-hydromash-environment-israel","fields":{"headline":"This startup is using jellyfish to make eco-friendly tampons, diapers and pads","bodyText":"This summer, many beachgoers around the US endured an increasingly icky phenomenon: waters teeming with jellyfish. In April, thousands of jellyfish invaded Hallandale Beach in South Florida, Miami, while officials continued to discourage visits to certain beaches in the US with expected jellyfish invasions. Global jellyfish populations have been steadily growing in recent years, driven by rising ocean temperatures, pollution and overfishing. In her book, Stung!: On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Oceans, scientist Lisa-Ann Gershwin argues the increased acidity in oceans have made it ideal for jellyfish to thrive. Aside from being a menace to beachgoers, jellyfish can also harm underwater infrastructure, clogging the cooling systems of nuclear power plants. According to the National Science Foundation, colonies of jellyfish in the Gulf of Mexico can be 100 miles long, with more jellyfish than water at their densest. Howard Carter, a bite prevention expert who developed a product to relieve jellyfish stings, believes the trend will continue: “More and more jellyfish will end up on the popular beaches like in South Florida, especially with the strong winds and currents in the US. There are already extremely poisonous species like the box jellyfish in the Caribbean Sea – which is not too far.” Now, one Israeli startup thinks it’s found a solution to tackling these swelling populations – biodegradable diapers and female hygiene products made out of jellyfish. Cine’al was conceived by Shachar Richter, a material scientist at the University of Tel Aviv, who began studying jellyfish a few years ago. As a material scientist, Richter looked closely at the flesh of jellyfish, and found that it could absorb liquid in large quantities. He and his colleagues then developed a super-absorbent material they named “hydromash”, which Richter says can absorb a high volume of blood and water. In order to produce hydromash, the company first breaks down the jellyfish flesh and then adds antibacterial nanoparticles to the mix, which remove the sting. The process converts the jellyfish into a strong, flexible but fully biodegradable material. Although jellyfish stings are painful and sometimes fatal, jellyfish are composed of 90% water. Richter and his colleagues realized jellyfish flesh could actually be used in medical bandages and sponges. Cine’al is now developing infant and adult diapers, as well as feminine hygiene products made out of hydromash. The company expects the products to hit the market in the next 18 months. The global diaper market size was estimated at $52bn in 2015, and set to reach $76.5bn by 2022. There are 40.37m diapers used daily in the US, most of which end up in landfills. About 43 million women in the US use tampons; on average, a woman uses 11,000 tampons in her lifetime. A typical disposable diaper or tampon can take hundreds of years to break down. According to Richter, a product made of hydromash takes less than 30 days to biodegrade. Cine’al isn’t unique when it comes to drawing inspiration from nature to create new materials. Biomason, a North Carolina startup, makes eco-friendly bricks grown with sand and bacteria. Coeio has invented a “burial suit” made out of mushrooms, which is intended to neutralize toxins found in a decomposing body and transfer nutrients to plant life after burial. Agroplast, a Danish startup, uses pig urine to produce bioplastics which could be turned into disposable plates and utensils. “If these products go mainstream, they can revolutionize the market and make an environmentally noticeable difference,” says Nir Davison, Richter’s colleague at Cine’al also involved in the development of the material. “Jellyfish are elegant, beautiful and intriguing creatures. If they’re studied properly, there are many more ways [they] can contribute to our lives,” Richter says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/06/china-says-britain-must-deepen-political-trust-as-hinkley-point-row-simmers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-06T04:40:34Z","webTitle":"China calls for deeper political trust with Britain amid Hinkley Point row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/china-says-britain-must-deepen-political-trust-as-hinkley-point-row-simmers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/china-says-britain-must-deepen-political-trust-as-hinkley-point-row-simmers","fields":{"headline":"China calls for deeper political trust with Britain amid Hinkley Point row","bodyText":"Xi Jinping has called for a deepening of “political mutual trust” with the UK amid a simmering row over Chinese involvement in Britain’s nuclear sector. In a 30-minute bilateral meeting on Monday afternoon, China’s president met with the British prime minister and, according to Chinese state media, told May that London and Beijing needed to “communicate and cooperate in various fields to achieve more stable and better development of their ties”. According to an account published by Xinhua, China’s official news agency, May “committed to actively deepening comprehensive strategic partnership and enhancing mutual understanding and trust”. Xinhua’s account of the meeting made no mention of the controversial £18bn ($23.5bn) Hinkley Point C project, which has threatened to derail the so-called “golden era” of UK-China ties since May delayed a final decision on its approval after taking office in July. According to the state-run news agency, Xi used the meeting, on the sidelines of the G20 summit, to inform May that China was willing to work with Britain to lift the partnership to “a higher level”. But the Chinese president also told the prime minister the two countries should “continue to promote pragmatic cooperation” in areas including energy, investment and infrastructure and “expand cooperation” in areas such as high technology and clean energy. During her visit to Hangzhou for the G20, May told reporters the “golden era” of UK-China relations – sealed by David Cameron and Xi during the Chinese leader’s state visit to Britain last year – was still alive. But the term was notably absent from comments made shortly before May’s meeting with Xi by a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry that China “always values its relationship with the UK”. Hua Chunying said ties between London and Beijing had been “developing with a sound momentum in recent years”. “We hope that the UK will continue to uphold a positive and open policy towards China.” A UK source described a “warm” meeting between May and Xi, and said the Communist party chief had not protested about the prime minister’s decision to review Chinese investment in the UK’s nuclear sector. UK sources said there was only an oblique reference to Hinkley Point C, the Chinese-backed nuclear project under review, and that Xi had told May he was willing to be patient about the government’s decisions in major projects. May’s decision to delay the project’s approval has been widely attributed to security concerns over Chinese involvement in sensitive sectors such as nuclear power. In 2015 Nick Timothy, May’s influential joint chief of staff, attacked the “golden” relationship with China. In an article last year for Conservative Home website, Timothy questioned the wisdom of giving Beijing access to such sectors, arguing there was no justification for giving “a hostile state easy access to the country’s critical national infrastructure”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/09/thursday-briefing-sorry-you-want-how-much","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-09T06:54:35Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Sorry, you want how much?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/thursday-briefing-sorry-you-want-how-much","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/09/thursday-briefing-sorry-you-want-how-much","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Sorry, you want how much?","bodyText":"Top story: Brexit ‘divorce bill’ looms Hello, Warren Murray here, bringing you this morning’s highlights. Theresa May heads into another awkward meeting today with fellow (for now) EU leaders. It is probably her last before Brexit talks are triggered. Brexit itself is officially off the agenda, but indirectly on it, as the European commission threatens a £1.7bn fine against Britain over imported Chinese goods flooding through Britain and on to the continent’s black market. France, Germany, Spain and Italy say they have lost billions in customs duties and VAT due to import-export rackets run out of the UK by criminal gangs. Any penalty could add to the potential “divorce bill” for quitting the union. Big US investors in Britain have meanwhile warned they might take their money elsewhere if access to EU markets is not maintained. And Pret a Manger is looking at both sides of the sandwich: it has pointed out that only one in 50 of its job applicants is British – so losing the supply of EU labour is not good news – but the chain is nonetheless “excited” about the prospect of employing more British nationals in the future. * * * Spring budget washup – Britain’s had the budget, you’ve had a sleep, now it’s time to get to grips with it all. Here’s our breakdown of whether you can expect to be better or worse off. Philip Hammond wanted it to be a low-key budget but a row over raising national insurance contributions for the self-employed put paid to that, with the government accused of breaking an election pledge. The last chancellor, George Osborne, presumably won’t have to worry too much about his own finances as he rakes in £650,000 working one day a week for fund manager BlackRock. * * * Travel ban challenge – Donald Trump is headed back to court over his latest attempt to restrict arrivals from six (previously seven) Muslim-majority countries. Hawaii is arguing that the new executive order is still the direct descendant of a “Muslim ban” and would make the state complicit in religious discrimination, as well as harming its economy. Other states are considering challenges of their own before the ban comes into effect in a week’s time. * * * Turbulence ahead – Airlines like Ryanair and easyJet campaigned unsuccessfully against Brexit and are now having to grapple with how they can continue operating smoothly when Britain’s skies are no longer shared with the European Union. There are fears that some routes could become unviable. Calls for a special agreement have so far fallen on deaf ears. Dame Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, says: “We don’t know what’s going to happen.” * * * Won’t forget this in a hurry – This sounds like clickbait but an ancient mind trick really can help you become a “memory athlete”, scientists say. Inside your “memory palace”, boring old names, faces, words and objects are mixed with vivid imagery (like “Claudia Schiffer swimming in a tub of cottage cheese”) to make them easier to recall. Neuroscientist Boris Konrad, ranked 24th in the world for remembering things, explains how it rewires the brain: “It does not make your memory capacity bigger; you use a different form of memory that already has a large capacity.” * * * How Greece fumbled the refugee crisis – In 2015 Greece became the EU frontline in the refugee crisis sparked by Syria’s war. The estimated £803m worth of assistance that poured in represents, per capita, the most expensive humanitarian response in history. But chaotic handling meant much of the money was wasted: while some of those in need were put up in ski chalets, others battled squalid conditions in freezing camps. This is a must-read in understanding a complex and desperate situation. Lunchtime read: Will Fukushima ever be fixed? It has been six years since an earthquake and tsunami sent the Japanese nuclear power station into triple meltdown. The worst such disaster since Chernobyl is far from over, with radioactive fuel unaccounted for, contaminated water leaking out, and most of the 160,000 evacuees from surrounding areas still living in exile. A succession of robots have sputtered and failed while pushing into areas where the radiation would kill a person in a minute. Our Japan correspondent, Justin McCurry, reports on a clean-up challenge that is “unprecedented and almost beyond comprehension”. Sport An emotional Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said he wanted to cry but “the tears won’t come out” after his side completed an absurd comeback – the greatest in Champions League history – with a 6-1 win over Paris St Germain. At the same time, former Barca coach Pep Guardiola was watching his Manchester City side miss out on the chance to go second in the Premier League with a 0-0 draw at home to Stoke City. While at the Emirates, the Arsenal hierarchy remain steadfast in their support of Arsène Wenger and believe he can pull the club out of their slump. In other sport, the World Anti-Doping Agency is considering a move to ban the controversial drug used by Bradley Wiggins before his Tour de France victory. Business Oil prices are again winning the attention of the markets after a barrel of Brent crude fell by 5.8% to $53.11 on Wednesday, the biggest fall in more than a year. Although prices have perked up a little in Asian trading overnight, the sharp fall was enough to put the skids under energy stocks and other commodities with most major bourses down. Futures point to a fall of around 0.3% in the FTSE 100 at the open. Overnight the pound was buying US$1.22 and €1.15. The papers The front pages are all about the budget, unsurprisingly, and some are more inventive than others. Two tabloids excel with budget puns – the Sun’s “Spite Van Man” attacks Philip Hammond’s national insurance rise for the self-employed. The Star gets in on the same theme with “Rob The Builder”. The Mail also is not happy: “No Laughing Matter” it booms, accusing the chancellor of “littering” his budget statement with jokes even as he broke Tory campaign promises. The Mirror takes aim at Theresa May with a picture of the PM mid-laugh. “What’s so funny prime minister?” it asks. The Times and Telegraph are more sedate in their presentation.

She said that reducing greenhouse gases was a duty to future generations, and pledged to continue with the UK’s carbon budgets to set a limit on emissions. Her promises, ahead of the first round of the Tory leadership vote among the party’s MPs, were significant. Many in the Brexit camp have disparaged climate change commitments and made abandoning the EU’s plans on emissions a key plank of their platform. Leadsom’s chances of snatching the prime ministership from the frontrunner Theresa May were boosted when Boris Johnson declared himself a supporter on Monday. She told an audience of energy professionals in Westminster: “It’s here that I’d like to be especially clear, to correct any misperceptions people may have about the implications of the EU referendum result. Decarbonising our energy system is not some abstract regulatory requirement. It is an essential responsibility that we hold towards our children and grandchildren, as the only way to effectively counter the threat of climate change.” She added: “However we choose to leave the EU, let me be clear: we remain committed to dealing with climate change.” The UK signed up to the landmark Paris accord last December that binds countries to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, but it negotiated as part of the EU. That would have meant the UK taking on shared national targets under the agreement, part of a bloc-wide “burden-sharing” arrangement that has still to be worked out in detail. Outside the EU, it is not clear what the UK’s next step will be in ratifying the Paris accord, although the government last week passed the latest “carbon budget” committing Britain to further reductions in emissions to the 2030s. Leadsom, the energy minister, was addressing the Utility Week energy summit just yards from parliament, where Conservative MPs were preparing to vote on which of the five candidates they want to drop out of the race before party members are presented with two, one of whom will become prime minister. During the referendum campaign, environmental issues played only a small part, but some of those prominent in the Brexit camp were clear in their opposition to climate regulations. The UK Independence party pledged in its 2015 general election manifesto to seek abolition of the Climate Change Act, under which the UK’s national emissions targets are set. Lord Lawson, one of the leading lights of the Brexit campaign, is also founder of a climate-sceptic thinktank. Leadsom set out her position: “The UK’s climate change act was passed by a majority of 463 votes to three. That is really quite extraordinary. The will of parliament has rarely been expressed so strongly and unambiguously.” She praised the government’s efforts on cutting emissions, encouraging investment in renewable energy, saying it was a “fantastic success story, of which industry and government can both be proud”. New jobs were being created and would be created in the future in energy industries, she said, including in shale gas exploration. She said she “made no apology” for the cuts in incentives for low-carbon power that the current government has made, and said the market would decide the UK’s future energy supply. Green campaigners said it was important that Leadsom, both as energy minister and as one of the main Tory leadership contenders from the Brexit camp, had reaffirmed action on climate change. Simon Bullock, of Friends of the Earth, said: “In these uncertain times, these are welcome comments that the UK remains strongly committed to tackling climate change. But bizarrely Ms Leadsom’s prescriptions do not mention energy efficiency, the cheapest action of all, nor does she mention the spiralling cost of Hinkley nuclear power station while onshore wind and solar are already cheaper [than nuclear power], and with costs still falling.” Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: “Andrea Leadsom’s defence of the UK’s world-leading climate change act is welcome, all the more so since some of her own MP supporters are inveterate climate sceptics. But it’s deeds, not words, that count, and much of what Leadsom has done as energy minister has been to undermine the clean technologies we badly need to meet our climate commitments.” Leadsom’s remarks were given a qualified welcome by Labour. Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of parliament’s environmental audit committee, told a meeting of the all-party parliamentary environment group: “Euroscepticism and climate scepticism are often two horns of the same goat.” Responding to the energy minister’s pledges, she said: “I have no reason to doubt her speaking in good faith.” But she noted that Leadsom came from a previous position in the Treasury, long regarded as lukewarm on climate change, and warned: “She would need to oversee a fairly radical change of direction at the Treasury [to fulfil her promises]. The likelihood of that happening while all eyes are on Europe? I’m not sure what grounds for optimism there are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2016/aug/15/uk-green-energy-sector-needs-nurturing-hinkley-point-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T12:08:00Z","webTitle":"UK green energy sector needs nurturing over nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/15/uk-green-energy-sector-needs-nurturing-hinkley-point-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2016/aug/15/uk-green-energy-sector-needs-nurturing-hinkley-point-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"UK green energy sector needs nurturing over nuclear","bodyText":"Britain’s need for a coherent long-term energy strategy has been woefully neglected by governments of both left and right. One example is the furore over the plan for a new and hugely expensive nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. Another is provided by the latest official statistics on the sort of energy the UK uses and where it comes from. The good news is that Britain is consuming 17% less energy than it was in 1998, and more of what is used is coming from renewable sources. But don’t get too excited. Green energy has increased from 1% of the total to just 9%. The bad news is that the percentage of energy Britain now has to import has returned to the levels last seen in the early 1970s, before North Sea oil came on stream. In the late 1990s, the UK exported 20% more energy than it imported. Today its imports are only just below the average for the EU. All this makes depressing reading. From the start, it was clear that North Sea oil was a finite resource, but governments acted as if the black gold would never stop flowing. Britain could have used its once-in-a-lifetime windfall to set up a sovereign wealth fund to cope with the pressures of an ageing population. It could have recycled the booming tax revenues from the continental shelf to start building some new energy plant before the old power stations became obsolete. In the end it did neither, with the results that we have now: power stations coming to the end of their lives at a time when the public finances are deep in the red. Still, let’s look on the bright side. Theresa May appears none too keen on Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point and a final decision on the project is still pending. On the other hand, the prime minister wants the UK to have an industrial strategy. The way forward is obvious. Put energy policy at the heart of the new industrial policy. Technological advances mean the cost of renewables are coming down all the time, and they represent far better value for taxpayers’ money than Hinkley Point C. The government should use tax breaks, procurement and its ability to borrow long-term at historically low interest rates to nurture a new green energy sector. This should have been done years ago, but it is not too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-costs-up-to-37bn","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-07T19:57:28Z","webTitle":"Estimated cost of Hinkley Point C nuclear plant rises to £37bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-costs-up-to-37bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-costs-up-to-37bn","fields":{"headline":"Estimated cost of Hinkley Point C nuclear plant rises to £37bn","bodyText":"The total lifetime cost of the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant could be as high as £37bn, according to an assessment published by the UK government. The figure was described as shocking by critics of the scheme, who said it showed just how volatile and uncertain the project had become, given that the same energy department’s estimate 12 months earlier had been £14bn. The latest prediction comes amid increasing speculation about the future of the controversial project in Somerset, whose existence has been put in further doubt by post-Brexit financial jitters. Hinkley has been a flagship energy project for the British government and in particular for the chancellor, George Osborne, who lobbied hard and successfully for China to take a stake in the scheme. Officials at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on Thursday confirmed the £37bn figure, but said it was provisional, set in September 2015, when wholesale power prices were low, and would not affect bill payers. “Hinkley will generate enough low-carbon electricity to power six million homes and around £10 [a year] from [each] consumer’s bill will pay for it once it is up and running. We have set the strike price to protect bill payers if energy costs go up or down, so the cost of the project to consumers will not change,” a DECC spokesperson said. “Today’s report from the IPA (Infrastructure and Projects Authority) does not suggest that the lifetime costs of Hinkley have increased. It is a sna shot of the position at the end of September 2015.” EDF said the £37bn figure should be disregarded. “Hinkley Point C will generate reliable low-carbon electricity in the future, so a cost estimate based on last year’s depressed wholesale price is not relevant. HPC’s electricity will be competitive with other low-carbon energy options and consumers won’t pay a penny until the plant begins operating.” But experts said the extra money, if the cost did remain at £37bn, would have to come from somewhere – probably the taxpayer – or be shaved off other DECC budgets available for different energy projects, such as windfarms and solar arrays. “This whole-life cost of £37bn is a truly shocking figure. It is an extraordinary ramp-up from last year’s figure, and just underlines how hard it is to get a real handle on the long-term cost of Hinkley,” said Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the Energy Institute, University College London. The latest increase is a new blow to a scheme with an already precarious outlook due to the debt problems besetting its lead developer, EDF, which has been hit by rising costs and delays to another new-build nuclear power station scheme, at Flamanville, in Normandy. EDF, a French group part-owned by the state, has high debt levels and has had difficulty convincing some of its own board members to support Hinkley despite the French government’s efforts to help it financially. The Brexit vote has made the British commercial environment much more uncertain, and French trade unions, who want the final investment decision postponed, have been pressing independent directors to convince EDF’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, to ditch Hinkley. Critics of the scheme have claimed that the fall in the value of the pound since the referendum vote will increase the costs of the scheme to EDF’s French contractors, who work in euros. But the management of the company said this week that the British referendum vote would not affect the project; it had completed its promise to consult further with the unions and was free to take a final investment decision. “Backed by the studies already provided to the representatives of the workforce, EDF considers that this [Brexit] vote in no way changes the fundamentals of the project, nor does it alter the desire of those involved to take part in it,” the management said in a statement. EDF directors , DECC and the French government have consistently repeated their determination to proceed with the already delayed Hinkley, which is expected to supply 7% of Britain’s total electricity when up and running. But the EDF staff council last month began legal action to try to force the company to release documents relating the project, including all the contracts it had signed with the British government and its co-investor, the Chinese utility CGN. The fall in power prices in the UK and continental Europe that has influenced the latest lifetime cost assessment for Hinkley is also responsible for some of the financial difficulties at EDF. There have also been suggestions that Chinese investors are becoming more nervous about Hinkley and are demanding more concessions from EDF, so that more Chinese project managers and suppliers are involved. EDF has denied this."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/21/peter-mandelson-i-try-to-undermine-jeremy-corbyn-every-day","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T19:46:59Z","webTitle":"Peter Mandelson: I try to undermine Jeremy Corbyn 'every single day'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/21/peter-mandelson-i-try-to-undermine-jeremy-corbyn-every-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/21/peter-mandelson-i-try-to-undermine-jeremy-corbyn-every-day","fields":{"headline":"Peter Mandelson: I try to undermine Jeremy Corbyn 'every single day'","bodyText":"Peter Mandelson, the architect of New Labour, has said he is working every day to undermine Jeremy Corbyn, as Blairite peers stood up in the House of Lords to lambast their party’s leadership for backing Brexit. Mandelson, a former cabinet minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, told an event for the Jewish Chronicle that he was actively working to bring an end to Corbyn’s leadership. His comments will be inflammatory at a time when Labour MPs have toned down their public opposition to Corbyn, after his second leadership election by a huge margin in the autumn. Mandelson, who has made no secret of his antipathy to Corbyn’s leadership, told the newspaper’s editor, Stephen Pollard: “The problem with Jeremy is not that he is a sort of maniac – it’s not as though he is a nasty person. It’s that he literally has no idea in the 21st century how to conduct himself as a leader of a party putting itself forward in a democratic election to become the government of our country.” He added: “Why do you want to just walk away and pass the title deeds of this great party over to someone like Jeremy Corbyn? I don’t want to, I resent it, and I work every single day in some small way to bring forward the end of his tenure in office. “Something, however small it may be – an email, a phone call or a meeting I convene – every day I try to do something to save the Labour party from his leadership.” In response, a Labour source hit back at the peer, suggesting Mandelson was part of the establishment. “The idea of Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister and implementing policies that actually benefit the people terrifies the establishment, so it’s no surprise Peter Mandelson has found time in his busy schedule of spending time on oligarch’s yachts to attempt to undermine him,” the source said. There is little appetite for another challenge to Corbyn among MPs, but a number of peers expressed fury about the leadership’s position on Brexit on the second day of debate on the Brexit bill in the House of Lords. In defiance of the shadow cabinet’s collective support for triggering article 50, Roger Liddle, a former special adviser on Europe to Blair and now a peer, said Corbyn had failed to fight plans for a hard Brexit and instead marched his MPs through the division lobbies to vote for it. Echoing the intervention of Blair on Friday, he said: “Let’s be frank, and I do say this with terrible sadness, the debilitation of our own party contributed to Brexit. We have a leader who, unlike the vast majority of Labour members including many of those who joined up in order to support him, has never been a European true believer. “And in the referendum he failed the key test of democratic politics, which is to cut through media cynicism and the mass of seething public discontents with a compelling and positive case for Europe which forced voters to listen. “And now I see no clarion call for the fight, only a three-line whip in the Commons to force Labour MPs to troop through the lobbies alongside a rightwing Tory government dancing to Iain Duncan Smith’s tune.” Another peer, David Triesman, a former Labour minister, said: “Keir Starmer [the shadow Brexit secretary] has done a fine job, a heroic job in many ways, but I don’t think anybody could say that opposition has been shown fully. I think, for example, the prime minister probably came here yesterday in order to seek a nostalgic reminder of what opposition was like.” Spencer Livermore, a Labour peer and former adviser to Ed Miliband, also criticised his own party for backing Brexit. “I have great humility about the outcome of the referendum and about the unelected nature of this house, but if we sincerely believe the course we are on will do untold damage to our country we have a duty whether elected or unelected to say so, to oppose it and to tell the truth,” he said. “I believe that working people’s lives will be made worse by this bill.” The discontent in the House of Lords comes amid jitters within Labour about the party’s prospects of holding the Copeland seat - one of the two byelections on Thursday. Gale-force winds and heavy rain could have a dramatic effect on turnout in the contests in both Copeland and Stoke, Labour sources have said, with some fearing any negative effect could hand victory to the Conservatives in Cumbria. Some Labour MPs said they were increasingly concerned about the effects of Storm Doris on turnout and those that had visited the seats said the Tory campaigns were growing in confidence. “Turnout is going to be the problem for us. I think people on a cold day in February will think: ‘Oh, why should I bother?’” one Labour MP said. “The Tories were only a handful of votes behind Ukip and I think they could even win in Stoke. If you’re an anti-Labour voter, and they are the majority in Stoke, you could decide to vote Tory. It could happen with a low turnout.” However, another Labour source said a low turnout did not necessarily mean there would be a Conservative victory in Cumbria. “The Tories need people to turn out just as much as we do,” the source said. “We have a very strong ground operation up there. It is genuinely impressive and disciplined considering the geography. The messaging is simply: we are committed to nuclear power and focused on saving the maternity services.” Another Labour backbencher said they believed the party’s relentless focus on the NHS would see them clinch Copeland. “I am getting the sense that the NHS has really punched through, as indeed it should. Campaign issues-wise, this is almost the perfect byelection for us.” The exact timing and course of Storm Doris remains uncertain, the Met Office said, but it is forecasting gale-force winds late on Thursday morning. The warning added: “There is potential for a short-lived core of very strong winds to develop. While some disruption is expected outside of this stronger swath of winds, the amber area looks most likely to see more significant disruption.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/apr/19/francois-hollande-to-gather-ministers-for-hinkley-point-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-19T17:21:32Z","webTitle":"François Hollande to gather ministers for Hinkley Point talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/19/francois-hollande-to-gather-ministers-for-hinkley-point-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/apr/19/francois-hollande-to-gather-ministers-for-hinkley-point-talks","fields":{"headline":"François Hollande to gather ministers for Hinkley Point talks","bodyText":"The French president, François Hollande, is expected to hold a meeting of government ministers at the Elysée palace on Wednesday to discuss whether or not the construction of the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant in Britain will go ahead. The French government is not yet expected to reach a final decision on the controversial plans for France’s state-controlled utility EDF to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. But the president and top ministers are expected to consider the various financing options for the project. EDF shareholders will then meet later this week to consider the options. After repeated delays, a shareholder vote and a final decision are expected in early May. The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, insisted on Sunday in a BBC interview that the Hinkley Point project would definitely happen, but he told EDF unions last week that a final investment decision on it had not yet been taken. Macron has repeatedly said the French government was working intensively to secure financing for EDF’s projects and was firm in its support for Hinkley Point. But Ségolène Royal, the environment and energy minister, has shown more reserve, saying earlier this month that a possible postponement of the project was still under discussion. The vast project is controversial in France. EDF, which is 84% owned by the French government, is already struggling with a debt pile of more than €37bn and trade unions have called for the project to be delayed. EDF’s finance director resigned last month and its trade unions warned the project could severely damage the company. If the project goes ahead, there could be major financial risk for EDF. But backing out could raise questions about French credibility. “Whatever the decision, the dangers are huge,” Le Monde quoted an EDF management source as saying. The fact that the Elysée meeting will be attended by a number of the government’s key ministers, from the prime minister to the foreign minister and economy minister, shows how high the stakes are. Hinkley Point will be one of the world’s most expensive nuclear power plants and will produce 7% of Britain’s energy needs by 2025. The project was announced in October 2013 but a final investment decision has been delayed as EDF struggles to find partners and financing. Chinese utility CGN signed up for a one-third stake last October, leaving EDF to fund the rest. The final decision by EDF to go ahead with Hinkley has been repeatedly delayed and the billions of pounds of state subsidies and the feasibility of the giant project have been widely criticised. Doubts over the project are also linked to the evolutionary power reactor (EPR) technology that will be used. There are no working versions, and other EPR plants under construction are running behind schedule and over budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-08T19:14:56Z","webTitle":"'Clean' coal won't be commercially viable before 2030, energy analysis says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/mar/09/clean-coal-wont-be-commercially-viable-before-2030-energy-analysis-says","fields":{"headline":"'Clean' coal won't be commercially viable before 2030, energy analysis says","bodyText":"“Clean” coal technologies won’t be commercially viable before 2030 without government subsidy and are fundamentally out of sync with the move towards more flexible power generation, according to the energy market analysis firm RepuTex. In a new analysis released on Thursday, RepuTex argues that the rising price of gas, coupled with the falling cost of energy storage, has now made renewable energy the cheapest source of reliable power generation in Australia. The long lead time before technologies such as carbon capture and storage reach commercial maturity means “clean” coal won’t help Australia meet its 2030 emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement. RepuTex used its submission to the Finkel review to argue that a market signal was required to determine the value of abatement and to allow an orderly retirement of ageing coal-fired generators. The firm said the market signal could take the form of an emissions intensity scheme, a legislated emissions benchmark, cap, or target that “better links emissions reduction objectives to the operation of the Australian electricity system”. While the debate accompanying the Finkel review has centred on the electricity industry, RepuTex pointed out energy was not the only source of low-cost emissions reduction potential in the Australian economy. “Outside of the generation sector, the effort to reduce emissions could therefore be spread across the economy,” the firm said. “This may be achieved via the design of sectoral targets for industrial emitters via the safeguard mechanism, supported by emissions offsets, which would enable companies to reduce emissions at lower cost, while incentivising investment in cleaner, more efficiency energy technology.” The call by RepuTex for a clear market signal follows similar arguments mounted by the National Farmers’ Federation, which this week reversed its once-vociferous opposition to carbon pricing. Other major organisation to champion a market mechanism include Energy Networks Australia, the retailer EnergyAustralia, the electricity provider AGL, the Climate Change Authority, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the Business Council of Australia and the CSIRO. The official conducting the energy review, the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, gave implicit support for an emissions intensity scheme in his preliminary report, saying it would integrate best “with the electricity market’s pricing and risk management framework” and “had the lowest economic costs and the lowest impact on electricity prices”. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, initially signalled the government would look at the desirability of an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector as part of its scheduled review of its Direct Action climate policy – but he reversed his position after an internal Coalition revolt. A major stakeholder in Australia’s politically toxic carbon pricing debate, the Minerals Council of Australia, has used its submission to rebuke Finkel for floating an intensity scheme in his preliminary report without detailed analysis of the costs. While the MCA doesn’t rule out supporting such a scheme, noting it is appropriate to consider all policy options, it says Finkel conducted “virtually no serious analysis of the economic costs”. The council, which represents Australia’s mining giants, says modelling “relied upon by the independent review shows the costs of an EIS are very high”. “For example, close analysis of one of the cited reports … shows the total additional cost to household and industry of an EIS configured around Australia’s contribution to a 2 degrees limit on global warming would reach $128bn over the period 2020 to 2030,” the submission says. “That is a fact germane to the broader national policy debate. At the very least, the independent review should be more transparent about these costs in its final report.” The MCA blasts Finkel’s preliminary report on a range of fronts, declaring it “conspicuously fails to examine the comparable costs of available energy sources” – declaring this “an extraordinary omission for a report of this kind”. The council uses figures dating from 2015 to argue that coal and gas technologies remain the lowest cost to build and operate. It asserts the review ignored the potential contribution of high-efficiency, low-emissions (HELE) coal technologies and ignored the potential of nuclear power. The MCA submission contains new research arguing that electricity networks face significant integration costs as the relative share of wind and solar energy rises – including the requirement to keep backup generation power on standby. The research says the direct subsidies paid by electricity consumers to achieve the large-scale component of the renewable energy target “are estimated at more than $1.8bn in 2016 alone but these subsidies only represent a fraction of the costs of this policy”. The research by the consultancy BAEconomics says integration costs increase significantly as the share of intermittent generation capacity in a power system rises. The MCA argues the costs associated with intermittent capacity should be borne by renewable generators. It also argues the government should provide support “to all energy sources or to none”. It declares that the final Finkel report must make a “clear and unambiguous statement in favour” of a technology-neutral approach to policy support for both CCS and HELE coal technologies – meaning the rules should be changed to allow the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in “clean” coal. The CEFC has said clean coal plants are not financeable in Australia unless the government agrees to indemnify projects against the future risk of a carbon price being introduced, and against the cost of delays prompted by likely community protest action. In its submission to the Finkel review, the CEFC noted there was no new coal-fired capacity among current proposals registered with the Australian Energy Market Operator. “Coal-fired generation tends to be relatively inflexible and not suited to a market with higher levels of renewable energy penetration and declines in daytime demand as a result of rooftop solar generation,” the CEFC said. “While the range of cost estimates for new coal-fired generation capacity are broadly comparable with new renewable energy capacity (excluding any cost for carbon emissions), negative investor perceptions mean that new investment in coal-fired capacity would be unlikely to be financed by Australian or international capital markets. “Investors perceive that new fossil-fuel generation capacity has carbon risk, which is the risk that a new asset would be stranded if a future government were to adopt tighter emissions constraints. “Further, there is arguably no longer a social licence for new coal-fired power stations in Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/apr/08/north-sea-oil-death-throes-rigs-decommission-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-08T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"North Sea oil is in its death throes.

But the industry has one last grand act left","bodyText":"To witness the beginning or end of a great industry or a way of living isn’t unusual. Each generation has its list of comings and goings – great grandfathers who remember the advent of the motor car, grandmothers who recall the last factory hooter in Accrington, fathers and mothers who can say where and when they last used a typewriter or first saw a mobile phone. But for the same generation to know both – the end, say, of the car or the typewriter, as well as their beginning: this is exceptional. North Sea oil is coming close to that distinction. Its life seems to be passing with remarkable speed. You don’t need to be impossibly old to remember the discovery of its first reserves in 1969 or its initial exploitation six years later, and while the very end is still some way off – perhaps as late as the 2050s, if the oil price goes high enough – its inevitability has recently become stark, and nowhere more so than at a recently built concrete quayside at the mouth of the Tees. This, I felt on Wednesday, looking around the quay and the adjacent hundred acres that waits to be filled by scrap, is where the ending begins. Next month, weather permitting, a barge will dock here carrying the superstructure or “topside” of an oil rig that has been brought more than 400 miles from the Brent field, which lies between Shetland and Norway and in 1982, its peak year of production, supplied enough energy to met the annual needs of half of the UK’s homes. Brent was the first of the big British fields – it gave its name to the international benchmark price for crude – and Shell has four big platforms there, named Alpha, Bravo, Delta and Charlie, the first three redundant and the fourth soon to be so. From their feet in the seabed to the top of their topsides, each is as high as the Eiffel Tower. Delta’s topside will be the first to be scrapped. In a different age – the age when the Teesside engineering company Dorman Long built the Sydney harbour bridge – the story of Delta’s topside would have been an illustrated feature (diagrams, arrows) in a children’s magazine. A structure weighing 24,000 tonnes and bristling with living quarters, workshops, heavy machinery and a helipad will be lifted en bloc from its sea-legs by a ship, the Pioneering Spirit, that will carry it close to the mouth of the Tees, where it will be lifted again, this time to a barge, the Iron Lady, which will bring it into the quay at Seaton Port near Hartlepool. There it will be slid rather than lifted ashore. Several superlatives are encountered on the way. The Pioneering Spirit is the largest construction vessel ever built (and possibly, at £2.2bn, also the most expensive); raising the topside will be the heaviest lift ever undertaken at sea; the new quay is said to be the strongest in Europe and situated in what was once one of the world’s largest dry docks. Little of this, however, could be described as a British achievement. The ship was built in South Korea and the engineers who spent years designing it work for a Dutch-Swiss company. The British aspect of the process is the location of the scrapyard, which is run by a private company, Able UK, owned by a 69-year-old Hartlepool-born businessman, Peter Stephenson. Without Stephenson, the work of cutting up Delta (and Alpha and Bravo) would probably have gone to the Netherlands or Norway, and a decommissioning operation funded in large part by British taxes would be benefitting owners and workers abroad. Compared, say, with the foreign ownership of UK train companies or Asia’s command of the London property market, a few thousand tonnes of old steel heading for Rotterdam rather than the ports of Britain’s east coast hardly represents a scandal. But the trade’s future scale is enormous. Over the next 35 years or so, about 470 platforms and 10,000km of steel pipeline will need to be removed from the North Sea. Within those numbers, according to the decommissioning forecasts of the UK’s Oil and Gas Authority, 109 platforms (95 of them in the UK sector, the rest Norwegian) will go between now and 2025. Some of the substructures pinning them to the seabed may be left where they are, to become marine habitats: an oil company proposal contested by environmentalists. The money that oil companies spend on decommissioning attracts tax relief in the form of rebates, which can amount to as much as 70% of the clean-up costs. As the tax originally paid was considerable – £330bn has been estimated as the total since production began – so are the rebates. Last year, tax relief exceeded the Treasury’s oil revenues for the first time. The oil price has risen since and North Sea oil’s net loss to the government may not be repeated in the near future, but the Treasury still faces a likely total bill of £24bn by the time the last North Sea well is plugged, which is more than the construction costs of Hinkley Point nuclear power station (estimated at £18bn) and around the same as building four new Trident submarines. The political consequences, especially for the Scottish National party, are well known. Stephenson feels, self-interestedly but perhaps also patriotically, that the benefits of this subsidy should be felt first at home. He started out as a hirer of farm machinery and now, as executive chairman of Able UK, runs as well as owns a company that deals in all kinds of dismantling, demolition, repairing and recycling. Cooling towers, petrochemical plants, tank farms, power stations, ships, oil rigs: Stephenson has got rid of some and refurbished others. Most controversially, he acquired the so-called “ghost fleet” – supply ships and tankers that had been laid up by the US Navy – and against environmentalist opposition broke them up safely in the same Seaton dock. A small, purposeful man, he and a small staff inhabit the former offices of the North Tees power station, the rest of which he demolished. I thought he might be the last industrial capitalist in northeast England and asked him where the rest of them had gone. All he could think, he said, was the old explanation: that Europe had been lucky, in a way, to have so many of its factories bombed flat – to have to start again. We drove across the strange estuarine land that lies between his office and the dock. There were cooling towers, only one of which steamed, and here and there chemical factories with steel chimneys that in the east wind trailed completely horizontal pennants of smoke. All were once owned by ICI – north Teesside was its magnificent manufacturing headquarters – to be complemented on the riverside by shipyards and, farther south, by an oil refinery and the steelworks at Redcar. A surprising amount of business still goes on – the landscape looks industrial as few other places in Britain now do – but of course the steelworks has closed and most of the rest is ultimately owned elsewhere. Would this be a fine place for the North Sea oil industry to stage its last grand act? Well, somewhere in Britain, certainly – to sustain work, perhaps even to develop an expertise in offshore scrapping, and remind us of what had been."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/17/uk-boris-johnson-ratifies-paris-climate-agreement","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-17T16:42:25Z","webTitle":"UK ratifies Paris climate agreement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/17/uk-boris-johnson-ratifies-paris-climate-agreement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/17/uk-boris-johnson-ratifies-paris-climate-agreement","fields":{"headline":"UK ratifies Paris climate agreement","bodyText":"The UK has become the 111th country to ratify the Paris climate agreement, which aims to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change by cutting carbon emissions. The foreign minister, Boris Johnson, who has flirted with climate scepticism, signed the pact in London on Thursday after a parliamentary deadline passed on Wednesday night, with no objections raised. Speaking at the UN climate summit in Marrakech, Nick Hurd, the industry and climate minister, said: “The UK is ratifying the historic Paris agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all. “I hope this will send a very strong message of continued international commitment to implement Paris because it is obviously very important to send that signal out.” Salaheddine Mezouar, the Moroccan foreign minister and president of the COP22 summit, told the Guardian: “It is excellent news that the UK has ratified, and it comes at the right moment. It is a good response to all those people who are sceptical about climate change.” The US election of Donald Trump, who has renounced climate science and promised to withdraw from the Paris agreement, has fed anxiety about future efforts to contain climate change. But while the UK’s Brexit vote may be moving the country closer to the US geopolitically – and has literally shifted its climate summit pavilion from the EU to the US tent – its endorsement of the Paris deal was widely welcomed as a boost to the Paris treaty. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr said that having set a target for curbing carbon emissions, the UK now needed to find the quickest and cheapest route to get there. “A mix of renewables, battery storage and efficiency measures is the way to go,” he said. “If Theresa May wants to have an industrial strategy that can cut emissions, create jobs, and help keep down bills, she should put low-carbon infrastructure at its heart.” The UK’s negotiating partners may also look to May to keep in check climate-sceptic impulses among some of her own ministers. Johnson has irreverently described the global leaders who drafted the Paris treaty as driven by “a primitive fear” that warmer weather was caused by humanity – a fear that he described as “without foundation”. Hurd said such talk should be taken with a pinch of salt: “Words count for one thing. You look for proof points. I think the fact that within days of this administration taking over, one of its first acts was to put into law the fifth carbon budget is an important proof point.” The shadow climate minister, Barry Gardiner, said: “The UK government must now show their commitment through climate action on the ground. We face a 47% shortfall to meet our 2030 climate target. Pursuing fracking and a six-fold tax hike on solar business rates only take us in the wrong direction.” To meet its climate commitments, the UK will have to decarbonise the lion’s share of its electricity by 2030 according to the government’s official advisers, the committee on climate change (CCC). The government’s strategy currently favours an expansion in nuclear power and fracking for shale gas, the latter of which could ramp up carbon emissions if it is not displacing coal. Controversially, it has also rowed back support for solar and onshore wind power. Clean energy business groups, though, welcomed today’s announcement as a sign that the UK would continue to play a progressive role in the international climate process. Stephanie Pfeifer, the CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents investors with over €14tn (£12tn) of assets in clean energies, said: “This encouraging announcement can only help sustain the ‘spirit of Paris’ and the momentum behind the international consensus to drive substantial action on climate change.” Jill Duggan, the director of The Prince of Wales’s Corporate Leaders Group (CLG), said: “The UK government’s ratification of the agreement today sends an important signal to international allies, businesses and investors about the inevitable transition towards a zero carbon economy.” Sir Crispin Tickell, former British ambassador to the United Nations, said: “Britain’s ratification of the historic Paris agreement is an important moment, not least because our country has for a long time led global efforts to cope with the effects of climate change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/dec/23/10-from-len-strictly-special-biggest-tv-power-spike-christmas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-23T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"A 10 from Len: Strictly special to drive biggest TV power spike this Christmas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/23/10-from-len-strictly-special-biggest-tv-power-spike-christmas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/23/10-from-len-strictly-special-biggest-tv-power-spike-christmas","fields":{"headline":"A 10 from Len: Strictly special to drive biggest TV power spike this Christmas","bodyText":"Len Goodman will follow in the footsteps of David Jason, Pauline Collins and an extraterrestrial as one of Christmas TV’s top challenges for the people tasked with keeping the lights on. When the judge finishes reminiscing over 12 years of Strictly Come Dancing on Friday night, kettles will be boiled, lights switched on and water company pumps powered up as toilets are flushed across the UK. National Grid forecasts the ballroom dancer’s show, Strictly Len Goodman, will drive the festive season’s biggest “TV pickup”, a sudden post-show spike in electricity demand. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also top of this year’s watch list. The three biggest Christmas Day pickups of all time are Only Fools and Horses, ET and Shirley Valentine. “It’s literally picking up the Radio Times and seeing what people are interested in,” said Jeremy Caplin, forecasting manager at the National Grid, who is not much of a soap watcher but knows most of their plots from listings. “It is definitely art rather than science. Every morning somebody will go through the previous day and fill in the database to see what programme had a pickup. We can use that history to predict what will happen going forward.” Caplin and his team also monitor social media and shows’ plots to make their forecasts. The smallest but still “significant chunk” of the post-show surge comes from people rushing from the sofa to the toilet, and water companies’ pumps simultaneously drawing electricity. Next is people flicking the lights on, which accounts for about a 10th of demand, and the largest demand comes from water being boiled for cups of tea and coffee. The power usually comes from places such as “Electric Mountain” on the edge of Snowdonia national park, where water is pumped uphill to a reservoir at times when electricity demand is low – and later released to turn turbines and rapidly generate electricity. Such “pumped hydro” accounts for around 70-80% of power for a pickup, with the rest mostly from large coal and gas power stations. “There are other options but it’s what they’re [pumped hydro] designed to do,” said Caplin, although the success of batteries in a recent auction of backup power suggests they may one day play a role in coping with our viewing habits. “In coming years we see more variety of sources, purely because of price on the day. I can imagine batteries coming on in the future instead of pumped storage.” Christmas Day is unique compared to the average day for the grid. A typical day’s peak demand comes in early morning and then early evening, but on 25 December the biggest demand is between noon and 2pm as turkeys are roasted. And an increasing number of those will be cooked by solar power – about three-quarters compared to half last year, according to the grid’s weather-dependent calculations. Bad weather also means the TV pickups are likely to be bigger, as more people are huddled inside and on the sofa. But today’s pickups are, like the importance of the Queen’s speech, not what they used to be. The spikes have been getting smaller over the decades, especially since their 90s heydays, when Del Boy and Rodney at Sotheby’s set the record at 1,600 megawatts, half the capacity of the new nuclear power station planned for Hinkley Point. Part of the decline is due to lighting getting more efficient. A modern LED bulb can provide the same illumination of an old-fashioned 100W incandescent bulb – which are now banned from sale due to EU rules – for about a 10th of the energy. “The lighting effect is a lot smaller than it was,” said Caplin. The other big change is not so much in what we watch – Eastenders and Coronation Street still feature high up in the lists as they did two decades ago – but how we watch. “You’ve got many more channels and you’ve got more flexibility in the scheduling. It’s not necessarily a reflection of the programming,” said Toby Syfret, TV analyst at Enders Analysis. As he points out, there has been a massive expansion in the number of TV channels, meaning the “linear competition” is much greater. Viewing shares of channels have plummeted accordingly, with ITV’s share down from 44% in 1990 to less than 15% today. “The really important reason is the fragmentation,” Syfret said. The other big reason, he said, is timeshifting via features such as Sky+, catchup services and “+1” channels. “If you’ve got a really popular programme, there’s less need to watch it at a particular moment. As we get more connected TV, there’s more erosion of audience at particular times,” he said. But while Caplin says there’s no doubting the long-term trend, he doesn’t expect to stop reading the Radio Times any time soon. “With reality TV, people are wanting to watch it live because they’ll find out on social media in 10 seconds. So you have to watch it live for the surprise.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/mar/31/jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-general-election-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-31T10:30:01Z","webTitle":"A seismic shift is needed for Corbyn to win in 2020.

But it could happen","bodyText":"Michael Crick’s doggedness in exposing the Conservative election expenses scandal may have weakened Theresa May’s desire to go for an early land-grab election and so political eyes slowly turn to 2020. The Labour party has been in an internal battle for its soul since losing the last election, but Jeremy Corbyn’s continued popularity among the membership and the prospect of a snap poll led to a fragile truce. If the party steps down from election footing, the devil will find work for idle backbench hands and the leader’s position is likely to come under sustained threat again. Labour should relish a more relaxed run-up to the election. Brexit will have had time to reap some of its bitter fruit and the Tories will have stumbled on with a small majority while tackling their own divisions over how hard and fast to pull up the UK’s drawbridge. The chancellor will have had time for a handful of budgets and reverses, which will further undermine the myth of Tory financial probity. Education cuts, middle-class kryptonite, will see school budgets decimated and Tory MPs will come under pressure from angry parents. But instead the party looks inwards and panics over the opinion polls. I rejoined the Labour party a year and a half ago after Corbyn’s election as leader. I didn’t have my arm twisted by Trotskyists, I just finally saw a party that could make genuine changes to Britain in general and the working-class community I come from in particular. I’m suspicious of leaders and over the years have become numb to rhetoric. Tony Blair promised me things could only get better and then broke my heart on Iraq and followed the Tories down the low-tax rabbit hole. Barack Obama spoke like an angel and charmed like a God but still made only the most minimal improvements to the lives of black Americans. Now when I look for bandwagons to jump on, I try to see beyond the winning smile and the dancing prose; I look for a leader with the right ideas and the integrity to carry them out if they get into power. In Corbyn, Labour has a leader who has been right on every major decision throughout his political career. He’s what Tony Benn described as a signpost. I’m vice-chair of the social policy organisation Race on the Agenda and earlier this month we hosted Corbyn talking about how Labour would champion race equality. White politicians promising to tackle racial inequality should come with a truckload of salt. Pretty promises to minority communities often fade away once votes are secured. But back in 1984, Corbyn was being arrested for protesting against apartheid in South Africa. When it comes to race, I trust him. He may not be the slickest with the teleprompter, sometimes stumbling or emphasising the wrong word in the sentence, but what he says is on point and comes from his heart. Being an unreformed ageing socialist, I’m used to being told I’m childish and idealistic. But I’m not a “deluded fan boy”; I’m not sticking my sword in the dirt and declaring “there is no king but the King in the North [Islington]”. While I am highly sceptical of opinion polls, the apparent size of the gap between the parties is daunting. A seismic shift will be needed for Labour to take power, even in 2020, but seismic shifts can happen in politics. Two years ago, Donald Trump was the punchline to a joke, George Osborne was destined to be the next Tory prime minister and Corbyn was a lovely old guy from the 1980s. We suffer from societal ADHD: forgetting what we thought yesterday and thinking that how things are today is how they will always be. The polling is frustrating because Corbyn has the policies to really break through. Building more council houses, nationalising the railways, properly funding the NHS, closing tax loopholes, defending the rights of workers. These are all popular with the public even while Corbyn himself languishes in the approval ratings. Blaming “the media” for the Labour leader’s poor ratings might seem churlish and blinkered but I honestly can’t remember a time when every single national newspaper set its stall out against a leader of the opposition. Every comment from his allies is examined for signs of impatience and every disagreement on the left is couched in terms of his failings. Losing the Copeland byelection is presented as an unmitigated disaster, but another way of describing it would be that Corbyn’s principled stance against nuclear power made this seat, with its 10,000 Sellafield jobs, a special case. At the same time historic wins in the City of London almost go without mention. When more than half a million people joined the Labour party to support Corbyn last year, this was dismissed as an electoral irrelevance; now that some of those people have become disillusioned and left, this is taken to be a massive indication that the Corbyn project is failing. Corbyn, we are told, has lost the working northern vote that is Labour’s bedrock. But the working classes didn’t abandon Labour – the border moved and they found themselves sitting in no man’s land. The same Labour MPs who ignored the working classes for 30 years were now blaming Corbyn for not being able to win them back in 18 months. But beyond the press and jittery MPs, we have to be honest about Corbyn’s failings. The main criticism, even among those who warm to his politics and integrity, is that he isn’t able to communicate his messages clearly. He hasn’t, so the charge goes, managed to present his story and himself in a way that is convincing to any but diehard supporters. “I like him, I like his policies, I like his integrity,” they say, “but he can’t convince other people, so it’s all pointless.” I’d argue if you are on board with the policies then why not spend your energies in helping argue for them? Rather than thinking in terms of a leader coming in and doing all the work, let’s think of a movement with each of us doing our bit to bring about the changes we want. If Corbyn doesn’t give great speeches then someone else should do some of the heavy lifting. But if you can’t lend your hand, as Dylan said: “Don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall.” I can’t say all of this, though, without admitting I have a fatal flaw. I’m unbearably loyal. I’m a Liverpool fan who was still chanting for Rafa Benítez and Brendan Rodgers long after their sell-by dates had passed. While the Tories focus on playing the man instead of the ball, there is always the opportunity to pass to another player and turn the polls on their heads. Decades of a centrally controlled Labour party, however, has led to a dearth of genuine socialist options. There are some young prospects but none that are obviously placed to take up the leftwing mantle. If it turns out that Corbyn isn’t the messiah but is, in fact, John the Baptist, I’ll be relaxed. Although from memory, it didn’t end too well for John."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2016/nov/12/electricity-bills-rise-energy-supply-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-13T11:11:56Z","webTitle":"Energy supply cuts may send fuel bills soaring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/nov/12/electricity-bills-rise-energy-supply-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2016/nov/12/electricity-bills-rise-energy-supply-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Energy supply cuts may send fuel bills soaring","bodyText":"Householders are being warned to brace themselves for a rise in their electricity bills as a series of freak events conspires to send wholesale prices rocketing. Safety concerns at France’s nuclear power plants operated by the energy company EDF have led to many reactors being temporarily shut down. There have been similar suspensions in Belgium. In addition, a lack of rain in Norway and Sweden – whose hydro plants generate large amounts of electricity for their European neighbours – has limited both countries’ energy production. The combined effect has been to send the price at which energy companies buy their power through the roof. Last Monday, a UK energy company buying power on a next-day contract would have paid about £150 a megawatt hour. The average price a year ago was £38.10. For companies that had not agreed forward contracts, the cost has soared to more than £1,000. Several smaller electricity suppliers have already raised prices or withdrawn competitive tariffs. Energy analysts say it will not be long before the big operators follow if, as looks possible, this winter starts with a protracted cold snap. An index tracking the price power companies pay for electricity, produced by the consultancy Cornwall Energy, is at its highest since it started in 2012. “It is unusual for there to be significant volumes of outages in the French nuclear fleet, however this is also one of our tightest winters in recent times in terms of extra capacity, which has also influenced how high prices rise,” said Cornwall analyst Tom Edwards. Twenty of EDF’s nuclear reactors have been stopped for checks on their steam generators, five more than would normally be shut down for maintenance at any one time. In July, EDF was forced to lower its 2016 nuclear output target to 395-400 TWh (terrawatt hours) from 408-416 TWh because of the need for “additional controls during the second half of the year” to show its reactors can operate safely. Last month, the group revised its nuclear output target again, from 380-390 TWh to 378-385 TWh. A spokeswoman said it was looking at ways to ensure it could maintain electricity generation by using its thermal and hydraulic plants. She said EDF would buy more electricity on the European wholesale markets if necessary and use “contractual flexibilities with some industrial customers and individuals to limit their electricity consumption”. Edwards said supply issues were currently to blame for price rises, but extra demand could soon be a factor. “The increase was primarily driven by rising wholesale prices, so the effect will be driven by supply and demand issues,” he said. “If it’s a cold winter and supply issues remain, then this should persist for the next three to four months. There has been some concern raised about how suppliers will cope over the winter if they aren’t able to hedge against these short-term price rises.” Earlier this month, the Met Office predicted that the chance of the UK experiencing temperatures in the “cold” category was 30% – 1.5 times the usual risk – and warned that “contingency planners and others with sensitivity to cold weather might need to consider this elevated level of risk”. Larger operators that generate their own electricity can protect themselves against rising wholesale costs. But this is not so for smaller operators. Earlier this month, Southend Energy, one of the larger independent operators, announced rises of 9% and 8.4% respectively on its fixed and greener tariffs. “Some suppliers have increased the price of their fixed tariffs following the recent rise in wholesale energy prices, which is putting pressure on all suppliers’ costs,” said a spokesman for the energy markets regulator, Ofgem, which suggested many consumers could save about £300 a year by switching. Edwards said the current uncertainty would be felt by consumers in the longer term. “Suppliers will increase their standard variable tariffs if costs do rise substantially, but this will be affected by their hedging ahead of this winter. We would expect fixed tariffs in the future to be higher to take into account expected risk of short-term price volatility.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/10/nuclear-waste-to-remain-at-old-uk-plants-rather-than-moved-off-site","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-10T08:00:27Z","webTitle":"Nuclear waste to remain at old UK plants rather than moved off-site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/10/nuclear-waste-to-remain-at-old-uk-plants-rather-than-moved-off-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/10/nuclear-waste-to-remain-at-old-uk-plants-rather-than-moved-off-site","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear waste to remain at old UK plants rather than moved off-site","bodyText":"More contaminated soil and rubble will remain at the sites of Britain’s old nuclear power plants rather than going to a dedicated dump, under government-backed proposals. But officials said that the sites would not be left in a hazardous state because international radiological standards would still be upheld. They argued the changes would mean former nuclear sites could be cleaned up more quickly, less waste would need to be moved around the country, and decommissioning would be cheaper than under today’s regime. Experts were split over the proposals. Some said that it showed the UK did not know what to do with its nuclear waste, but others welcomed it as a way of saving money. The government said a change to the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, outlined in a discussion paper last week, is needed now because several sites will reach the final stage of cleanup in the early 2020s, such as Winfrith in Dorset and Dounreay in Caithness. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) currently oversees the licensing of 17 nuclear sites that are slated for decommissioning and cleanup. The final stage involves dealing with large amounts of rubble, concrete, brick and soil, some of which is radioactive and designated low level waste (LLW). That waste currently goes to the UK’s only LLW site, at Drigg in Cumbria, which is almost full. Industry, the regulator and the government want that last stage of the process to no longer be the ONR’s responsibility, and for the LLW to instead stay at the former nuclear sites, which range from old power plants to research facilities. “It is possible that local communities may be concerned that this would mean the site being left in an unacceptable or hazardous state. This would not be the case,” the paper said, because the changes would not go ahead if they were inconsistent with the radiological standards of health watchdog Public Health England. Malcolm Grimston, a senior research fellow at Imperial College London, said the current system was unwieldy and the change would be a better use of money. “While we continue to treat radioactivity as if it was in a different category of hazards, we perpetuate this idea that radioactivity is more dangerous [than other hazardous material], which the science doesn’t back up.” He added that the level of radioactivity was low enough that local communities should not be worried at more waste being left at sites after their cleanup. “Even if people decided to eat this stuff or set up house and live as close as they could, there would be no detectable change in the cancer rate.” But nuclear critics said the changes showed the government lacked a long-term plan on nuclear waste. “It’s another example of how much of the stuff we have and we don’t really know what we’re going to do with it, we’re just leaving it [the LLW]. It’s an appalling choice,” said Dr Paul Dorfman of University College London, who was involved in the decommissioning of Harwell in Oxfordshire, a former nuclear research site which is now partly used as a business park. “The notion of the acceptability about LLW being just low level: you can say low, but this stuff is dangerous. You don’t want this stuff near you,” he said. Under the proposed changes, former sites would no longer be considered “nuclear” at the end of their cleanup, and therefore no longer the responsibility of the ONR. Regulation would fall instead to the Health and Safety Executive and environment agencies. “What the government is suggesting is, they’re turning off the liability but they’re not turning off the risk or hazard,” said John Large, a nuclear consultant who has advised the UK government on nuclear issues. He said one of the drivers behind the change might be the pressure on the ONR from regulating and overseeing the new nuclear reactors planned in the UK, such as EDF’s new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and the regulator wanting to lighten its load. “I suspect the ONR are cutting their cloth here, I suspect they are hard pushed,” he said. The government’s discussion paper said the changes could not be made without legislation being amended to allow the ONR to relinquish regulation of sites in their final stages of decommissioning.

The ruling was welcomed by ministers and the nuclear industry but Austria threatened legal action against it, while consumer champions said it could add more than £5bn a year to energy bills. A majority of commissioners agreed Britain was not breaking state aid rules, overcoming the last regulatory hurdle for EDF Energy and its plan to construct Hinkley Point C in Somerset, south-west England. EDF believes the project will cost £16bn but the EC claimed construction costs alone by the time the plant is built in 2023 will be more than £24bn with a further possible £10bn of contingency payments. Joaquín Almunia, EC competition commissioner, had earlier overseen a heavily critical report on the subsidy arrangements drawn up by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Almunia argued that the EC could agree the measures in favour of Hinkley because the subsidy regime had been “significantly modified”, limiting distortions of competition in the European single market. British ministers see new nuclear reactors as important to provide low carbon energy when many old atomic and coal-fired stations are nearing the end of their lives. The subsidy arrangements guarantee the French electricity generator will obtain £92.50 per megawatt hour over the 35-year life of the Hinkley plant. This subsidy, twice the current price of electricity, will be paid out of customer bills and DECC claims it will represent a significant saving on alternatives such as gas, whose price is expected to rise even more sharply and which gives off significant carbon emissions. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said the EC decision was an important step on the road to Britain’s first new nuclear power station and a good deal for consumers. “While there is much work still to do before a final contract can be signed, today’s announcement is a boost to our efforts to ensure Britain has secure, affordable low carbon electricity in the 2020s,” he said. Hinkley Point C will be able to supply 7% of Britain’s electricity and could avoid about 9m tonnes of CO2 emissions a year being released by fossil fuel-generated power. But Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, said Hinkley set a “bad precedent” because guaranteed payments had previously been reserved for renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar. He said Austria was opposing the commission decision on economic and environmental grounds, saying nuclear power was not a sustainable form of energy, was a mature technology and was not an option for combating climate change. Nick Butler, a former No 10 energy adviser, said the whole subsidy arrangement was a mistake that would punish consumers and should be investigated by parliament’s public accounts committee. “The deal will go down in history, alongside the privatisation of the Royal Mail, as an example of the inability of the British government – ministers and civil servants alike – to negotiate complex commercial deals,” he wrote in a blog for the FT.com. Greenpeace said the EC move was a world record sellout to the nuclear industry at the expense of taxpayers and the environment. “It’s such a distortion of competition rules that the commission has left itself exposed to legal challenges,” said Greenpeace EU legal adviser Andrea Carta. Guy Newey of independent energy supplier, OVO Energy, said it would push up people’s bills for decades while Mark Todd, director of independent price comparison site energyhelpline, said: “The EU’s go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant could see UK homes collectively foot the bill for an additional £5.2bn per year on top of their current electricity costs.” But Lord Hutton of Furness, chairman of the British Nuclear Industry Association, said it was an important step in securing Britain’s home-grown low-carbon electricity generation while adding jobs and prosperity to the economy. Horizon Nuclear Power, owned by Toshiba of Japan and which wants to build new stations at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire, said the EC move was “a huge boost”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/15/inquiry-backs-nuclear-waste-dumps-for-outback-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-15T01:42:19Z","webTitle":"Inquiry backs plan to store world's nuclear waste in outback Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/15/inquiry-backs-nuclear-waste-dumps-for-outback-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/15/inquiry-backs-nuclear-waste-dumps-for-outback-australia","fields":{"headline":"Inquiry backs plan to store world's nuclear waste in outback Australia","bodyText":"The storage and disposal of used nuclear fuel from other countries is likely to deliver substantial economic benefits for South Australia, a royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle has found. On Monday, the South Australian royal commission released its tentative findings, which backed nuclear fuel storage and left the door open to further uranium mining and processing but came down against the use of nuclear power for electricity generation. The findings said a nuclear storage and disposal facility would be commercially viable and South Australia could store nuclear waste as early as the late 2020s. It suggested the state set up a sovereign wealth fund “to accumulate and equitably share the profits from the storage and disposal of waste”. The royal commission noted the main hazard from developing an industry storing other countries’ used fuel rods was emission of radiation into the natural environment, including that particles emitting radiation could be inhaled or ingested by humans and other organisms. But it said Finland and Sweden had both developed safe facilities for long-term disposal of nuclear waste. Risks could be mitigated by storing waste in solid form in geologically stable areas, and several layers of packaging and containers to prevent waste contaminating groundwater. South Australia was suitable because of its low levels of seismic activity, arid environment in many parts of the state, stable political structure and frameworks for securing long-term agreement with landowners and the community. The report did not consider specific sites for nuclear waste dumps. The draft findings were that nuclear waste storage and disposal could generate $5bn a year for the first 30 years of operation and about $2bn a year until waste receipts conclude. This would result in $51bn profit over the life of the project, it said. The report predicted nuclear storage would create approximately 1,500 full-time jobs during a construction period of about 25 years, peaking at 4,500, and leaving more than 600 jobs once operations begin. The report also said expansion of uranium mining could be economically beneficial but “it is not the most significant opportunity”. The royal commission said uranium processing could not be developed in the next decade as a standalone industry as the market was already oversupplied and uncertain, but fuel leasing, which links uranium processing with its eventual return for disposal, is more likely to be commercially attractive. It said nuclear power would not be commercially viable in South Australia in the foreseeable future but suggested further planning as “nuclear power may be necessary, along with other low-carbon generation technologies” in the future. The royal commission will now conduct five weeks of consultation, with responses due by 18 March. The commission’s final report will be delivered on 6 May. The federal government is currently searching for a site for the long-term disposal of its low level and intermediate level nuclear waste. Conservation Council SA chief executive Craig Wilkins welcomed findings that nuclear power, uranium conversion, enrichment and nuclear fuel reprocessing were not economically viable but opposed the proposal of nuclear storage. “If we pursue a nuclear waste dump path, we are saying the best we can do is accept the worst the world has got,” he said. “The royal commission presents an optimistic view of potential profits from offering Australia as the world’s nuclear waste dump. It acknowledges that nuclear waste needs to be isolated from the environment for many hundreds of thousands of years yet there is no attempt to cost the management of waste over those timeframes,” Wilkins said. Federal minister for resources and energy Josh Frydenberg said the government welcomed the release of the interim findings as an opportunity “to discuss new and expanded industries that could create jobs, growth and significant revenue for Australia”. But he said expansion of Australia’s nuclear industry would require significant legislative and regulatory change. Frydenberg said the federal government’s proposed national nuclear waste facility would only store low and intermediate level waste. “It cannot and will not be built to store radioactive waste generated overseas or high level waste,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/13/observer-view-post-brexit-britain-trading-vulnerability","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-13T23:03:19Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on post-Brexit Britain’s position in the world | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/observer-view-post-brexit-britain-trading-vulnerability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/observer-view-post-brexit-britain-trading-vulnerability","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on post-Brexit Britain’s position in the world","bodyText":"China’s senior diplomat in Britain, Liu Xiaoming, has a reputation for undiplomatic remarks. The ambassador’s infamous likening of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government to Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter’s threatening nemesis, did little to ease historical bilateral tensions between the two countries. His blunt remarks last week about the delay to the Hinkley Point nuclear power station project ordered by Theresa May also jarred badly. Liu put the government on notice that cancellation of the troubled £18bn scheme, in which the state-owned company, China General Nuclear Power (CGN), has (or would have) a 33% stake, could have serious, negative consequences for wider trade, investment and political relations between Britain and China. His warnings about damaged “mutual trust” and a “critical juncture” sounded less like the counsel of a friend, more like the threats of a bully. There was a time, not so long ago, when ill-considered public comments by a senior Chinese official might have been safely ignored. Britain was often the target of vituperative abuse in the period leading up to the Hong Kong handover in 1997. Chris Patten, the last British governor, still bears the scars. The pressure did not discernibly affect government policy. But times change and so, too, does the balance of power, which has swung decisively in China’s favour in the succeeding two decades. Britain needs China now in ways it did not in the past. This does not mean insulting or threatening behaviour is any more acceptable. But it does mean that May will feel obliged to give serious weight to China’s concerns over Hinkley when a final decision is made next month. Similar pragmatic calculations lay behind the ingratiating welcome afforded Xi Jinping, China’s unelected Communist leader, in London last autumn, and the former chancellor George Osborne’s myopic championing of a lucrative new “golden era” in Sino-British ties. If it is to prosper in a globalised 21st century prospectively dominated by China and other emerging powers such as India, Britain must, to some degree, kowtow to Beijing. In recent years, China has invested more capital in Britain than in any other EU country. As an export market, its potential is unmatched. Britain, meanwhile, despite all Osborne’s austerity, is deeply in debt and living beyond its means. As Stephen King of HSBC put it: “If the Chinese turn their backs on us, then we’ll have to tighten our belts even further, particularly if we’re given a frosty reception by the Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, reducing the opportunities for British business to operate within the world’s most dynamic region.” But this changed reality is also partly the product of choices freely entered into. By voting to leave the EU, Britain has made an additional rod for its back. Brexit will exacerbate Britain’s vulnerability, both economic and political, in a dangerous world where, as Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, rightly says, it depends increasingly on the kindness of strangers. As we have argued in the past, it may be time, as American and west European power fades, for countries such as China to shape a new world order. Who knows, they may eventually do a better job. It would not be difficult. Yet it is also true that China’s one-party system, its huge democratic deficit, its lack of transparency, its disregard for human rights, religious freedoms and international legal norms, and yes, its leaders’ tendency towards bullying are sharply at odds with British values, standards and policy aims. The Hinkley decision has suddenly been rendered more fraught by US allegations of industrial espionage involving CGN and by Australia’s refusal, on grounds of security, to allow Chinese control of a key energy asset. This tension between who we are and who we do business with has always been present. A good example in recent decades has been Britain’s close and controversial collaboration with oil-rich Saudi Arabia. But corrupting though the alliance with Riyadh was, it did not fundamentally change Britain’s worldview. The case is altered now. Our wilful undermining of our key European alliances means that over time, Britain, alone, may struggle to stand up to the likes of China, defend its values and maintain relationships based on mutual respect. There will be more Hinkleys. The effect could be highly corrosive. In the big, bad, lonely world beyond Brexit, predators of many varieties roam. Last week saw a reminder from the incorrigible Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, that the Crimea crisis of 2014 is far from over and that the war in Ukraine could reignite at any moment. The particulars of the latest flare-up are less significant than the fact that Putin again appears ready to place European security at hazard, just as his actions regularly challenge Nato, his bombers and helicopter gunships murder civilians in Aleppo and his sports officials blithely ignore international doping rules. Surely nobody is sensibly suggesting Britain, in a fit of panicky, post-Brexit international outreach, should try to bury its differences with the reckless, lawless regime in Moscow, notwithstanding last week’s embarrassing telephone calls to the Kremlin by May and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary. Putin, after all, stands accused by an official British inquiry of direct complicity in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, the former KGB agent poisoned with polonium in London. If Putin were an African leader, there would be calls for him to be investigated by now by the International Criminal Court for possible war crimes in Syria, Ukraine and Chechnya. Yet the question nevertheless arises: how does Britain, no longer working in close concert with France, Germany and Poland, propose to manage the Russian problem? Will Moscow, like China sensing weakness and uncertainty, be tempted to pressure and bully May’s untested government, even as armed forces chiefs warn they are outgunned by the Russians? Will May try to win Putin round or will she confront him? Her first test comes next month at the G20 summit in China. One thing is already certain: the hapless Johnson is no match for Sergei Lavrov, his veteran counterpart. A Lavrov-Johnson summit would be like inviting a wolf to take tea with a tethered goat. Brexit’s champions promised to forge a range of post-Brussels international relationships, thereby creating a more vibrant, prosperous Britain. China and Russia show just how perilous and problematic this project is. History suggests Britain can look to the US for succour and support. But with American confidence failing, and a weird Trumpian dystopia taking root, even that fall-back seems in jeopardy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2018/oct/24/coalition-labor-morrison-shorten-energy-nauru-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-24T07:34:12Z","webTitle":"Malcolm Turnbull could have saved Wentworth, Barnaby Joyce says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/oct/24/coalition-labor-morrison-shorten-energy-nauru-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2018/oct/24/coalition-labor-morrison-shorten-energy-nauru-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Malcolm Turnbull could have saved Wentworth, Barnaby Joyce says – as it happened","bodyText":"And with that, we shall bid you adieu, at least until tomorrow morning. I will be shocked, SHOCKED I tell you, if both Marise Payne’s mic slip and other estimates goodies don’t end up as part of the morning talking points tomorrow. Other than that, it will be more fun and games. I think, given the recent pattern, we can expect Scott Morrison to be out and about early, as he follows the path laid down by John Howard to try and own the news agenda from the beginning. It doesn’t work like that so much anymore – witness how many headline changes this blog goes through in a day, for instance – but he is giving it a red hot go. We’ll bring you that, and all the other happenings as we all struggle through the last joint sitting for three weeks. Kerryn Phelps is all but declared as the winner of Wentworth, but we might need to wait a little bit longer for the final bits and pieces to be finalised before it is officially announced. But was Malcolm Turnbull to blame? Not everyone thinks so. No doubt there is some juice left in that tank though, as the conservatives who caused Turnbull’s demise continue to be shocked that he did not turn around and continue doing everything they wanted. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers and Guardian Australia’s brains trust who are all still at their desks, because this place never stops. And to you, for keeping us company all day, and letting us, and others know about it. We do read your messages, even if we don’ always respond. Rest up tonight, and remember – take care of you. How Mike Bowers saw QT: In that Sky interview, Joel Fitzgibbon says the Nationals, through a “closely related polling company” have been robocalling regional areas in NSW “to test Barnaby Joyce”. “Barnaby Joyce’s big strategy now is to say see those Libs over there, they are hopeless, we accept that, but we are the National party. “… I know of people who have had calls,” Fitzgibbon said. “Asking whether his personal life should impact on his capacity to do the job. “Does your personal life impact on your capacity?” Joyce interrupts to ask. Fitzgibbon continues: “You can’t tell me Barnaby Joyce doesn’t know about this.” Joyce says: “Mate, I don’t know about it, so there you go.” Siri, define awkward: On Malcolm Turnbull’s role as Australia’s envoy to the Bali oceans’ conference Barnaby Joyce had this to say: “I’m looking forward to coming back and finding the oceans exactly where we left them. I think that’s a great outcome – all oceans saved!” On Malcolm Turnbull not campaigning: “I am reflecting a view of concerns people have had, and they have been calling me, believe you me, they think if you are prime minister of Australia, leader of the Liberal party, leader of the Coalition, then you have a responsibility to do your very best to make sure that the government you represented is maintained in its majority. “Now, he resigned number one, and problem number two is he didn’t campaign to save his own seat, and that annoys people. And it would annoy people in the Labor party too if it was in the same position, believe you me. “... It is the national interest that we maintain a Coalition government, right (says the man who caused a byelection after section 44 issues and then almost toppled the government by having a child with his staffer while married) “... So people do their part to try and remove a coalition government, which is what you do when you don’t campaign to maintain the party as the party which represents Wentworth, then you obviously, move towards Labor, Greens and independents running Australia and for people on our side of the political fence, that is anathema and not in the national interests. “... The results speak for themselves. Show me where he actively campaigned for Dave Sharma in a pertinent form. And I truly believe, because he does have a long strong following, that if he had, Dave Sharma would be the member for Wentworth and we would still have a majority in parliament. “... Sometimes you just have to suck it up, I know that better than most, you have to suck it up and keep fighting.” Barnaby Joyce thinks Malcolm Turnbull could have saved Wentworth if he had campaigned in support of Dave Sharma: Has everyone forgotten why the byelection in Wentworth was held? After LGBT advocates – and even Michelle Grattan – were asking where the bill to protect gay students is – I have an answer. A spokesman for the attorney general, Christian Porter: “The government has provided the opposition a first draft and is continuing to negotiate on the proposed amendments. A subsequent draft will be provided to the opposition this afternoon. It remains the government’s intention to introduce the bill this week. It is preferable to have an agreed bill to introduce.” Heading back to Defence estimates, Penny Wong asked what it is Steve Ciobo, the minister for defence industry, actually does. While the public servants go through their papers to find the answer to that, Marise Payne turns to Angus Campbell and the microphones pick up her whispered: It’s fair to say I am enjoying this. What she is enjoying, we will leave up to you. Perhaps she is just enjoying an afternoon out in estimates. So many people not taking lectures in this place: Michelle Grattan is now trolling the government over how long it is has taken the government to draft its ‘urgent’ legislation to protect LGBTI kids from loopholes in religious freedoms, which could see them, in federal law, expelled from religious schools for their sexual orientation. And for those who missed the unveiling of the latest portrait, we will have a video for you soon. “A victorious warrior wins, and then goes to war. A defeated warrior first goes to war, and then seeks to win.” Penny Wong: Would you prefer that your commanders were made aware of significant foreign policy decisions before the media? Lieutenant General Angus Campbell, CDF: Senator, I am very comfortable that our active mechanisms of Force Protection Review consideration and adjustment achieve their objective and continue to achieve their objective in giving our people the best circumstances to achieve their missions and to return home safely. Wong: I have no doubt as to your professionalism. I am asking is it better practice for you to be advised before the media? Campbell: (10-second pause) Yes, Senator. Wong: Thank you. This is true: Fair go/fair dinkum got a go four times in question time today. Which is also how much of a run it got on WSFM this morning. Canberra bubble was heard twice, but each was like 10,000 bees flying directly into my ears, so it seemed like a lot more. Wait – we have just had a reference to “the butcher and the baker”. I guess we don’t have candlestick makers anymore, but it really just leaves you hanging. And with that, question time ends. Whatever David Littleproud is saying in this dixer, Barnaby Joyce is nodding. Mark Butler to Melissa Price: My question is to the environment minister. I refer to reports the minister told the former president of Kiribati: “I know why you’re here, it’s for the cash. For the Pacific it’s always about the cash. I have my chequebook here, how much do you want.” The minister 100% denied making that statement but on Thursday she couldn’t recall the complete conversation but apologised anyway. Yesterday the minister was again in denial. How can the minister not remember what she said and at the same time be 100% confident she didn’t say it? “Oh shut up,” comes from the government benches. “This is so pathetic.” “Don’t burst that bubble.” Price: We have got so much to talk about in this place and we have achieved an awful lot on this side for the economy and also for the environment. The way that the conversation was reported by Patrick Dodson was incorrect. I’ve said that in the past because of the words that were used. Thank you. “You said you couldn’t remember it,” yells Labor. Paul Fletcher is back and if white noise had a voice, I think we have just found it. The defence department secretary, Greg Moriarty, has confirmed no background checks are carried out on Myanmar military personnel undergoing training in Australia, to ascertain if they were involved in atrocities against Rohingya people in the troubled Rakhine state. “At the moment, the Department of Defence does not have a vetting procedure in place in relation to our activities with Myanmar,” Moriarty told a Senate estimates hearing. Moriarty said it was in Australia’s interests to retain the modest program to help professionalise the Myanmar military and encourage personnel to uphold international law. This financial year taxpayers forked out $257,000 on the non-combat training program that covers peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and English classes. Defence spent $400,000 on the program the previous financial year. Myanmar’s military has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in Rakhine state in a damning UN report. Catherine King to Greg Hunt: Is the minister aware his own department provided a list yesterday of 83 medicines that have been recommended by the independent experts but not listed on the PBS? Is the minister aware the list includes medicines that were recommended as far back as 2016? How can the minister stand by his previous answer on PBS listings when he has delayed access to some life-saving drugs for more than two years? Hunt: “Let make this absolutely clear. I did a little bit more research on their claims yesterday. And I saw the lists that the member for Ballarat put out. I think it was in August of eight medicines she claimed had been deferred. None of them had been deferred by government policy. And I looked at two things. I looked at major new listings we have done recently and I looked at what they did. Major new listings we did recently in terms of breast cancer, SMA, cystic fibrosis, and many other, all done within... “...In terms of the list last published by the member for Ballarat, very interestingly she claims that hepatitis C medicine was deferred. We did a little bit of research and discovered that the company didn’t have the medicines available. “...And requested the government delay until they had the medicine. Once it was announced they could supply immediately. The advice was provided by the company. But the total period for the medicine she talked about was an average of eight months to listing and then compared that with Labor’s deferred medicines. The seven medicines that they deliberately delayed by an average of...” King comes forward with a point of order: “I was asking about the information provided by the minister’s own department overnight, that shows you have not listed 83 medicines, some from back as far as 2016.” Hunt: Our policy is clear. We will list every medicine that the PBAC recommends. Their policy was absolutely clear, that they would defer the listing of medicines until such time as fiscal circumstances permitted. And I did a little bit more research as to the Senate committee. What did the Senate committee say about their policy at the time? It constitutes a major unnecessary and unwelcome change in government policy. What did the consumer’s health forum say? Consumers do not want a situation in which drugs are listed on the PBS to win votes or boost opinion polls. That’s what they said about the Labor government and the Labor policy at the moment. What was said about the Labor government and the Labor policy at the time, the decision to defer to list medication jeopardises the integrity of the PBS process. So now is the time for the member for Ballarat to apologise for incompetently misleading the House yesterday in relation to hepatitis C, in relation, in particular, to whooping cough, caught out, caught red-handed and time to apologise. King attempts to table the list – and is denied. “What have you got to hide,” yells Labor. Greg Hunt takes a dixer so he can accuse Catherine King of misleading the house with her question yesterday: One of the claims made yesterday by the member for Ballarat was that we had in some way deferred the listing of a whooping cough medicine. I thought that doesn’t seem right but I’ll check the fact because I’m not going to take what the member for Ballarat said on face value. And I was right to check the facts because the member for Ballarat said was that the PBAC recommended that the whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women be listed in July 2016. No, it didn’t. It said that provisionally, there had to then go and be a critical study by the Australian technical advisory group. Some of the most respected medical professionals in the country. And they did that with their consideration in February and October of 2017. Provided their final advice to the PBAC and the PBAC made their recommendation in February of 2018. And we announced our listing in of 2018 and we delivered it on 1 July 2018. The member for Ballarat misled the House. I’m not saying it was deliberate, I am saying it was incompetent. Mark Butler to Melissa Price: On Sky News this morning the minister confirmed she had looked at the IPCC report closely. As the minister is aware the greatest threat facing the Great Barrier Reef is the threat of climate change. What is the report conclusion, what is the report saying on the fact of 2C warming? Price starts explaining what the report does. This is exactly like when I did not not prepare for oral assessments and would just stand up in front of the class and cherry-pick a word from the topic and then expand on that, until the time was filled. “The topic is on Leonardo da Vinci and his impact on modern society. Leonardo was a man out of his time. Much like Leonardo DiCaprio, whose seminal role in Romeo and Juliet...” (although, to be fair, DiCaprio has actually spoken on the need to save the Great Barrier Reef, so it’s closer than this answer.) Price (reading from stapled papers): The Government respects the credibility of the international panel on climate change. (That’s not what you said the first time, yells Anne Aly.) As we have said in the past, that we will consider this report and other relevant information on climate change in our decision-making. The IPCC makes no recommendation to government. What it does is that it gives the view on a variety of things with respect to the environment, including reefs around the world, not just the Great Barrier Reef. It presents a series of model pathways to limit global warming. I might point out those model pathways include a range of technologies in the energy mix beyond 2050. And just as Dr Alan Finkel has said, the debate should not be about technology when we’re talking about emissions and with respect to climate change. Mr Speaker, we are very determined to protect the health of the reef. We are the ones who have invested significantly in the reef, unlike those opposite who had them on the watch list. We got them off the watch list. We are particularly committed to those 64,000 people who rely... and the billions of dollars the reef contribute to our economy. I should think the people in Herbert would care about what we are doing with the reef. What about the member for Dawson? Do they care about how we are investing in the reef? I think so. He cares very deeply about what we are doing about the health of the reef. We will continue to review the IPCC report. The people of regional Queensland know they can trust us. They can’t trust that mob. Tony Burke to Melissa Price: “What is the government’s current policy on nuclear power plants?” Price: “Currently the legislation does not allow such nuclear plant development.” We move into a dixer from David Coleman, who has teamed his Australian pin of truthiness, fair dinkum power and true blue bubbles, with a fetching yellow tie. Not even Peter Dutton’s BUT WHAT IF horror story is enough to save question time today. I hear interjections saying to bring them here. Bring them here, Labor says. Well, Mr Speaker, let me say this. If you want to see children in detention, vote for Labor. If you want to see deaths at sea again, vote for Labor. If you want to see those 17 detention centres reopen, vote for Labor. Because the fact is that Labor, when they were in government under Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard, are making exactly the same mistakes as we are seeing now by this leader of the opposition. He has a pile of letters and he is not afraid to use them, but the chamber is so loud, it drowns him out and he is left to basically address Scott Morrison. Tony Burke to Melissa Price: “Does the minister rule out approving new nuclear power plants?” Price: “There is no change to government policy.” I guess when your words have been what have got you into trouble about two seconds after taking the job, saying less of them is a lesson well learned. Kevin Andrews is reading a book on Winx. This tells you how much attention the backbench is paying today. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: When the now PM was treasurer, he cut over $83m from the ABC. Last night at Senate estimates the acting manager director of the ABC said and I quote: “Those sort of budget reductions aren’t achieved without major disruption.” Will the PM now reverse his cuts so the ABC won’t be forced to cut services, including the vital service it gives to Australians living in rural and regional Australia? Morrison: Canberra bubble. Oh wait, he is also asking about whether Labor thinks the ABC should get a special deal. I guess he forgot about the $30m Foxtel got in a special deal, then? I swear to Rhianna, if I actually took up the suggestions to drink every time one of these guys said ‘fair dinkum’ or ‘Canberra bubble’ lately, I would probably need to put to bed by 11.30am. You know people who don’t care about the Canberra bubble? People outside of the Canberra bubble. For the rest of us, who have backgrounds outside of politics, who speak to people outside of these hallways, and have lives away from our jobs, it just makes our eyes twitch. Linda Burney to Scott Morrison: I refer to the reports the prime minister has dumped Malcolm Turnbull as his envoy because he didn’t help the government. Can the PM please explain to the house how Malcolm Turnbull has been unhelpful to the government but the government’s other envoys (including the member for Warringah) have been good for government unity? Labor laughs and Morrison takes to the floor: The reports are false. I would encourage the opposition to spend a bit more time focusing on questions about the economy, about drought, about electricity prices and get their heads out of the Canberra bubble. Angus Taylor is doing his best to answer a dixer on “fair dinkum” electricity and Labor keeps yelling out “where’s the big stick”. “Come on Twiggy!” comes the call from the opposition benches. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware of a newspaper article written by Sharri Markson and it reports the prime minister is done with Malcolm Turnbull and won’t ask him to represent Australia in the wake of his failure to help in Wentworth? Given only this morning the PM said Malcolm Turnbull would represent the nation extremely well, is that report correct? Is the PM really ruling out... Plibersek runs out of time, but the question is all but done. Morrison: “It’s not.” And that’s not my brevity. That’s the whole answer. The Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, has had a win in Senate estimates, embarrassing the government by getting the head of the defence force, Angus Campbell, to say it is best practice for the military to hear about significant policy changes before the media. The context for the question was that before lunch the estimates hearing established the media were briefed before defence about the proposal to consider moving the Australian embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. John Alexander gets the next dixer (because all the MPs with scary margins are the favourites lately, as we head into election town). Josh Frydenberg points out that he is a victor over Kristina Keneally. But given that Keneally is the reason a safe seat is now considered marginal, and she is here in the building anyway, I don’t think it is the brag he thinks it is. Anthony Albanese gives us another dose of Michael McCormack, because too much Michael McCormack does not exist. I refer to reports in the Herald Sun that in the budget funding for 10 infrastructure projects, including the Rockhampton Ring Road, Mackay Ring Road stage 2, they were secretly approved but not announced. Why at a time when the road toll is rising and congestion in our cities is worsening is the government sitting on these projects and not delivering them? McCormack: We are delivering the infrastructure that Australians want, expect, need and deserve. We are rolling those infrastructure projects out and I would have thought that the shadow minister for infrastructure, having sat with me in a very bipartisan way about road safety, would not have brought road safety into that question. I know the shadow minister for infrastructure has road safety on his mind, just as I do. I’ve heard the shadow minister for infrastructure talk about the Kempsey bus crash. And I know the Coffs Harbour bypass, he’s talked about it. We’ve delivered it. We’re getting on with the building of it. That’s what we do. Those opposite talk. We deliver. We build for road safety and we build for better connectivity. We’re getting on with the job. We have got $75bn, a record amount of infrastructure, that we are rolling out. We’re rolling it out now. We’re rolling it out into the future. It’s a decade-long pipeline of investment. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’ll continue to do. Albo jumps up with a point of order – given that McCormack hasn’t actually addressed the question. McCormack comes back to the dispatch box, but continues to say words in an order which do not form an answer to the question. Michael McCormack is back to doing his best impression of who he thinks Michael McCormack should be. Barnaby Joyce is red, but is at least listening to the leader of his party. I can tell you the same cannot be said for most of the backbench. Cathy McGowan has the crossbench question. Speaking of the crossbench, Bob Katter is not here. Well smash me down and call me avocado. McGowan: “Last week I spoke at the Regional Universities Conference hosted by Southern Cross University. We discussed how regional higher education institutes support work force development, create jobs and drive regional growth. Education employment and infrastructure provide the anchors for regional population growth and need to be part of any population policy. “Minister, can you give us an update an how regional education will be integral to population policy and an update on the government’s response to the recommendation of the Regions at the Ready Report for a national regional higher education strategy?” Dan Tehan: “Can I thank the member for her question? And she knows, as all members in this House who represent regional and rural electorates know, the importance of regional education to our regions. “Not only the importance of education but also the importance of employment and also the importance of infrastructure. And anything that this government does to help drive population growth in to the regions, she can be rest assured that education will be central to that, that infrastructure will be central to that and also that employment will be central to that. “Can I advise the member, that currently there are 400,000 primary and secondary students living in regional, rural and remote Australia. This is compared to around 214,000 tertiary students who are living in the regions. “And what we want to see is as many of those students who are at the primary and secondary level go on to either a first-class tertiary education or first-class vocational training. “And that is what we are trying to do. And we know that will help when it comes to population growth. “The Regional Universities Network, the conference of which the member spoke at, have estimated that between 60% to 80% of their recent graduates are now currently employed in regional areas. “So there is proof positive that if we can educate our children in the regions they will stay there and they will be employed there. Progress on the regions was asked and can I commend the member who chaired that, the member for Murray who chaired that committee report. “And it is an excellent report. It rightly points out local education and training that is engaged in its community is pivotal to regional development and decentralisation. “Absolutely true. Now, I’m looking very closely, very closely at the recommendations in that report which are relevant to education. “And I will have more to say on those matters. And I know that the relevant minister is also looking at the broader report and will have more to say on that very shortly. “Because it’s an important piece of work when it comes to advising the government on what we should be doing to growing our regions in a very sustainable way and in a way which encourages our young to not only look to the capital cities but to look to their own communities as places where they can be educated, where they can go on to build families, where they could go on to be successfully employed. That is what we’ve want to see as a government. I thank the member for her question” Well then, that’s almost a proper answer. It’s almost as though the government is preparing for when it needs the crossbench’s support. Head, meet desk. This is dire. Chris Bowen to Josh Frydenberg (following a dixer on the economy and any “alternative” approaches) My question is to the treasurer and refers to his answer just now. Given the modelling that he referred to does not model Labor’s reform to negative gearing and does not recognise that Labor’s policy grandfathers existing investments, and given the Government’s own treasury modelling shows a modest impact from Labor’s policy of negative gearing reform, will the PM now apologise for misleading the Australian people?” Frydenberg: Beware those who protest too much. That’s what I say, Mr Speaker. Because this is what the Master Builders Association’ CEO said: ‘We didn’t need to consider the grandfathering because we’re looking at future investment.’ So the hits in terms of increased housing means future investment is less likely and therefore we will see a downturn in the housing sector as a result of Labor’s policy, Mr Speaker.” “We know, we know that Labor’s policy will hit those who have invested in the property sector, the teachers, the police officers, the emergency services, the nurses, Mr Speaker. “And we know and we know that the Labor party’s policy is a new Labor party policy because what did the then treasurer of the Labor party in Australia say when he was, when Labor was last in government? “What did he say? What did he say about negative gearing? This is what he said when he was treasurer. “He said he it would be economically disastrous to do anything on negative gearing. Economically disastrous. “Now he is the incoming president of the Labor party, maybe he can change this disastrous Labor policy and increase property tax on hard-working Australian families.” So many sick burns see Terri Butler warned for whatever it is she is calling out. I can’t hear it, but she accepts it with a “fair” shrug and we move on to a dixer delivered by someone I have never seen before in my life. Oh it’s Chris Crewther. And the first question is on … Malcolm Turnbull. And Bali’s oceans conference. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: This morning the prime minister spoke glowingly of his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, saying: ‘I have no doubt Malcolm will represent Australian government policy and the Australian nation extremely well.’ Would he please tell the Australian people why is Malcolm Turnbull no longer the prime minister of Australia?” Morrison: “I thank the member for his question about the former prime minister’s attendance at that summit in Bali. “Eight weeks ago, when I met with President Widodo and he indicated to me the former PM had expressed his willingness to attend that summit. “This is an important summit both for Indonesia and more broadly about the future of our oceans. I was unable to attend that summit because of my other commitments. “And we discussed the issue, President Widodo and I, and woe thought it would be a good opportunity if the former PM would be able to attend that summit, given their strong close working relationship. “I will always put the diplomatic and national interest of Australia ahead of any other considerations.” [“What about the embassy?” comes the call from the Labor side of the House.] “What I will do is act in the national interests of Australia and I look forward to the former PM being able to represent us on that occasion. “The decision was taken weeks and weeks ago. I believe it was the right decision for Australia. “And I will continue to work constructively with former prime ministers, whether they continue to be in this chamber – the member for Warringah doing a terrific job, working hard on getting Indigenous kids into schools. “I was very pleased to welcome the former PM Julia Gillard to this chamber this week. “And I’m very pleased that she has been here today and recognised with the unveiling of her portrait here in the House.” “I remember this is what was said in Paul Kelly’s Triumph and Demise about what two former PMs thought of the leader of the opposition: ‘The distrust between Rudd and Shorten was intense and enduring. The Gillard camp was contemptuous of Shorten, considering him weak and duplicitous. Neither side trusted him and neither side revised its view.’ “How insightful.” I am heading into the chamber for question time. Mostly so I can go screaming down a hallway and not bother the Guardian’s brains trust, but also to check on the mood. Hit me with your QT bingo tips! The portrait has been officially hung. Still working out who got moved to make room. Harry Jenkins’s Speaker portrait was moved for Peter Slipper’s portrait. Which is the most accurate case of art mimicking life I have ever seen. Labor, the Greens and Senate crossbench are putting pressure on the government to release legislation it promised before the Wentworth byelection to prevent discrimination by religious schools on the grounds of sexuality. There are concerns that unless the bill prevents discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation OR gender identification that trans kids won’t be protected. The Greens’ LGBTIQ spokeswoman, Janet Rice, also makes the point that Scott Morrison said parliament “should use the next fortnight” to ensure the issue of discrimination is addressed – and that deadline is up tomorrow: The Greens already have a bill before the Senate that would prevent discrimination against students AND teachers on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identification, marital status or pregnancy. There is no clarity yet from Labor about their plan to include positive protection for religious schools’ ethos and whether this will prevent them voting for the Greens bill. Labor’s equality spokeswoman, Louise Pratt, said the opposition wants to work with the government and blames the Coalition for not releasing its bill. “Schools have a whole range of ways to uphold their ethos ... without relying on exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act to do that,” she said. Pratt noted the Greens bill can’t pass the lower house, adding it was “premature” to say how Labor would vote because we don’t know which bill will go to a vote, but she said the sentiment behind the Greens bill was “very good”. Also, it won’t be a conscience vote for Labor. Now that Wentworth is all over but for the final counting, the Greens want Scott Morrison to follow through on a promise he made before the byelection: The Australian Greens are calling on Prime Minister Morrison to deliver on his promise during the Wentworth byelection to remove the ability of religious schools to discriminate against LGBTIQ+ students. “When the heat was on during Wentworth, the prime minister promised a bill would be passed by the end of this week removing discrimination in religious schools,” said Senator Janet Rice, Australian Greens LGBTIQ+ spokesperson in a statement. “Where is the bill? Or did the prime minister lie to the people of Wentworth?” “There is one day of parliament left, so he better hurry. Time is ticking, prime minister.” “The Greens have a bill that is already being debated in the Senate. If the prime minister doesn’t deliver on his promise to pass a government bill this week, the Greens will do the job for him when the Senate next sits.” The chief of the Australian Olympic Committee, Matt Carroll, delivered today’s National Press Club address. He was speaking about needing investment in sport (he wants $60m to get Australia’s Olympic chances back where Australians expect it) and the chance of Australia bidding for the 2032 games. But he gets a surprise question at the end: Leisel Jones, Olympic gold medallist: I want to speak a little bit further about mental health and the benefits of sport with mental health. Suicide rates in Australia are costing Australians millions of dollars and suicide rates are our highest deaths between the ages of 15-44. And I have to be honest and say – I think due to sport, I didn’t take my own life. So I think that there is a huge importance in the link between sport and mental health. Can you please explain and perhaps expand a little bit in the importance and how the funding for sport may bring down our suicide rates in Australia and how the cost to Australians may be reduced? Carroll: How long have I got! As I said, investment in sport comes in a number of ways. To answer your question – there is investment in getting people participating in sport. So that’s very important. So that’s a combination of the sports, of state government and federal government and private enterprise, to be fair. So that’s important. Inspiring our young athletes or non-athletes to take up sport, that’s a job that the AOC is happy to do. That’s what Olympics Unleashed is all about. We’re happy to commit our investment into that space. We don’t represent one sport, as I said, we represent multiple sports, and when we go into a school, or I beg your pardon, when you go into a school and your fellow Olympians go into a school, you’re talking about your experience, you’re talking about the ups and the downs, the not so good and the challenges. That’s the inspiration that we can deliver to kids, that it’s not all about winning. It is actually the journey along the way. And that’s what athletes have told me or Olympians have told me. The podium is an outcome. It’s the journey that matters. The investment in that space and the partnership with the Sports Commission in the other space around participation and systems and program and all of the talent pathways, that all makes it possible. But it’s our job to take the success of the Olympians, the power of the Olympics, and translate that into a conversation with our school children across the country. That’s what Olympics is unleashed, that’s why we call it Olympics Unleashed. The parliament has had such “unprecedented” interest in where Julia Gillard’s portrait will be hanging, it is being hung early. As in now. The Barnaby Joyce resurgence has gone quiet, for the moment, but it is not gone. Gabrielle Chan has looked into what rural and regional communities actually want: Prominent rural advocates have become increasingly vocal over a potential return of Barnaby Joyce to the National party leadership as the prospect of a concerted independent push in rural areas gains momentum after the Wentworth byelection. A nascent political movement, Anyone But Nats, has started to run advertising across northern NSW ahead of the 2019 state and federal elections. It has been funded by the IT businessman, Charles Tym, whose family has donated $20,000 to fund 400 advertising spots across regional television stations. Tym, who donated to Tony Abbott’s 2013 election campaign, describes himself as a “rank novice” in politics who was formerly a “mad Liberal party voter” but now is supporting candidates who are against coal seam gas and want progress on climate change. “It was climate change that tipped me over and Abbott in particular. He’s done everything over the last few years to stymie progress on climate change and the Nats won’t stand up for their constituents and stand up for what they want because they are in the thrall of mining companies,” Tym told Guardian Australia. For those keeping count of the unnecessary branding road Scott Morrison is forcing us all down, ‘fair go/fair dinkum’ was used 10 times in the press conference he held this morning with Angus Taylor. Labor is not letting go of Stuart Robert’s internet bill (he has paid back almost $40,000) anytime soon. Don Farrell and Murray Watts put out this statement: The Finance and Public Administration Committee heard that the Department of Finance: Was not involved in any discussions with Minister Robert regarding his bills; Did not request he provide any documentation with respect to the internet use that resulted in massive bills that were to the taxpayer; and Was unable to provide any evidence that Minister Robert did not profit by using his taxpayer-funded dedicated data line for private business purposes. Officials also gave evidence that the Special Minister of State, Alex Hawke, who was tasked by Scott Morrison with investigating Mr Robert, was on leave for a period during the investigation. True to form, Scott Morrison clearly never took this issue seriously. Rather than insisting on an independent investigation, Scott Morrison kept one of his closest leadership coup allies safe by having him investigated by another. Minister Hawke must now explain exactly what he has done to ensure that taxpayers’ funds were not used inappropriately by Mr Robert. Angus Taylor repeats “fair dinkum reliable power” in his explanation to Sky News on what the government is trying to achieve. “Fair dinkum power?” Tom Connell asks. “Despatchable power,” Taylor amends. I’m pretty sure they just heard my sigh in Rockhampton. Feel free to caption this: Just for the lols, as someone who spent their first seven or so years in South Australia (long enough to pick up some of the speech accents) I really felt this: ANTHONY ALBANESE: Good to be with you. I almost resigned from this segment, when I rang in they thought I was Christopher Pyne. HOST: Is that right? PYNE: Moving up in the world, good luck to you. ALBANESE: I’m offended. HOST: Does that happen very often to you, Albo? ALBANESE: Never! Never ever. HOST: You are quite different blokes, aren’t you? PYNE: He’s starting to take on all my mannerisms and voice; he’s becoming a South Australian. HOST: They don’t speak very elegantly, the Sydney people, do they, Chris? PYNE: But obviously Anthony is learning, which is great. ALBANESE: I’m learning to speak properly. HOST: He’ll be saying ‘dance’ and ‘vase’ soon. PYNE: Yes, and ‘graph’. HOST: Graph, the graph. PYNE: And ‘pool’ and ‘school’ rather than pool and school. Anthony Albanese and Christopher Pyne spoke about it on Adelaide radio 5AA for their weekly chat: Albanese: You look at the postal votes as they’re coming in, instead of being around two-thirds of the vote; yesterday’s results were just 55 for the Coalition when they needed 70. The fact is the prepolls; the government did better in people who voted early than they did on the day. And that’s because decisions like floating moving the embassy to Jerusalem, voting for ‘It’s OK to be White’ – all of those things were diabolical in the electorate. Pyne: I can tell you that on the Monday before the byelection our polling had us at 41% two-party preferred and we’ll end up at about 49% two-party preferred. So in fact in the last week we pulled the vote back when people realised in Wentworth that we could actually lose the seat or that we were going to lose the seat. But I do think people are thoroughly sick of talking about all these internals, this inside the bubble conversation in Canberra. People want us to get on with the job and that’s what we’re trying to do with economic growth and new jobs and projects like the defence industry in South Australia. And I’m sure that Labor and the press gallery are desperate for us to talk about ourselves. We’ve got to stop it and get on and talk about new things. Wentworth was lost; we know that, that byelection is over. We’re getting on with it now. Pyne really has a way of always finding the bright side of life, doesn’t he? We reported last night that the speculated Liberal recount in Wentworth was unlikely to happen. Party sources gave it a big fat no when I asked, given that, well, as a delaying tactic, it wouldn’t work. Parliament doesn’t sit again for another three weeks after tomorrow (at least the House doesn’t sit), by which time a recount will have been well completed. So Kerryn Phelps should be confirmed as the winner by then. Portraits we are missing (by my count): Tony Abbott Kevin Rudd Malcolm Turnbull It’s been a busy few years. The parliamentary gift shop can’t keep up. Mike Bowers is on the scene and will have some photos for you very soon, but in the meantime – The portrait is huge. HUGE. It’s a close-up of her head and shoulders with the background of Parliament House windows. She said she wanted it to stand out, and it certainly will. Julia Gillard’s speech goes into what sort of story she wanted the portrait to tell: I started thinking about what kind of portrait I wanted it to be. And of course you can’t capture in a portrait so much of what happens in politics. There’s no way in a portrait to tell the story of doing all of the negotiations for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There’s no way to tell how many hours we spent trying to improve the standard of Australian education, particularly in our schools. There’s no way of telling of the trips overseas to improve our relations with China, with the US and to get us on the UN Security Council. There’s no way of telling the story of time spent in parliamentary question time with the adrenaline and putting a price on carbon. There’s no way to look at sleepless nights into the royal commission into child sexual abuse. But I decided that there was one story I did want to tell. That I was different to every other prime minister who came before me in this place. By that, she means she was the first woman. So she asked the artist, Vincent Fantauzzo, to tell that story, as she wanted a portrait that looked different to every other one. And she looks forward to a time when it doesn’t matter any more – that it is so common for women to be considered prime ministers, it is not even a thought. Julia Gillard’s official portrait is being unveiled today. She opens her speech, with some acknowledgements: There are too many here to acknowledge by name, but I would like to acknowledge former prime minister Tony Abbott, thank you for joining us, and future prime minister Bill Shorten. You kind of would have expected that from me, I think! I’d like to acknowledge family and friends who are here today. Many people have come from a long way away to join me at this occasion. Thank you for doing that. I’d also like to acknowledge a number who couldn’t come – either because of logistical issues or because returning to this place in front of the glare of the Canberra press gallery wasn’t exactly their idea of a great day out. So to those who love and care about me, but made that choice, I know that you’re here in spirit too. I can understand approaching this occasion with a few mixed emotions, because that’s how I felt in terms of getting my portrait done. For me, being in Parliament House was always about purpose, it was about policy, it was about getting big things that mattered done for the nation. I was always less attracted with the pomp that goes with being in a place like this, and I put in my mind getting my portrait done in that category of pomp and ceremony, and I wasn’t particularly interested in doing it. But I received a very good piece of advice from my staff. Each period, we’d go through things that I was supposed to have done and the portrait was on the list and I’d always say, let’s just forget about it. And finally, there was a day when Nina, who works in my office, came to me with a very serious expression on her face saying, “You know, you ought to get that portrait done before you look a hell of a lot older than you did when you were prime minister!” To the younger MPs in the house, you may have heard about staff that give you frank and fearless advice, that’s all in capital letters and underlined. Frank and fearless – it’s not frank and fearless until you’re winded by it. When Nina said that I thought, yes, I really should get this done. The former foreign minister Julie Bishop has responded to Fairfax Media’s story questioning whether she may have breached ministerial rules which require them to pay for gifts worth more than $300. The story notes Bishop has declared a pair of “Aboriginal print shoes” by Grand Master Lineage on her register of interests – but the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has no record of them being declared as official gifts over the $300 threshold (a separate requirement that arises under ministerial rules). Grand Master Lineage is a Chinese company connected to Jimmy Choo, who collaborated with Australian Indigenous artist Peter Farmer for a new line of couture shoes featuring Aboriginal artwork. The shoes were declared in March. Bishop ceased to be foreign minister in August, when she declined to remain in the ministry after Scott Morrison took over from Malcolm Turnbull. On Wednesday, Bishop was door-stopped after delivering a keynote at a security conference. “I comply with the register of interests,” she said. A spokeswoman told Guardian Australia “that is her response”, declining to answer if Bishop had breached the separate ministerial rule on gifts exceeding $300 in value. Mathias Cormann has some things to say and he will say them! While we are on Scott Morrison’s habit of branding things unnecessarily, could someone please explain what hokey-pokey politics is? Is it like Hocus Pocus? Because I legitimately love that movie. Does it involve shaking it all about? The ice cream flavour? Whatever it is, Morrison won’t be doing it when it comes to asylum seekers: First of all we are getting kids off Nauru, we have been doing it for years. We’ve got hundreds of kids off Nauru and we’ll continue to do that in the way that we’ve been getting about it and we’ll continue to maintain the integrity of strong border protection policies. You don’t get kids off Nauru by putting more on, by having weak border policies. So that’s been a key focus. But I mean the key thing is David, mate, I’m not going to play hokey-pokey politics, it’s not going to be “left foot in, right foot in”, all that sort of nonsense. We’re a centre-right party where we do get the balance on these things right. You can look after kids and have a strong border protection policy. You can get electricity prices down and meet the reductions targets that we’ve set for Paris. You don’t have to choose between these two things, you don’t have to get caught up by the shouts from the left and the shouts from the right, you just do your job every day and you stay in the sensible centre-right where successful Liberal and National governments have always been. That’s certainly where I’m going to be, no hokey-pokey politics from me. Anne Ruston, most famous for giving an exceptionally long speech at Georgina Downer’s concession byelection party earlier this year, had a chat to ABC Adelaide during which she was asked what “fair dinkum power” is. In a rare show of political honesty, Ruston admitted that like most of us, she had no idea: “Fair dinkum power?” she said. “...I’m sorry. You’re going to have to give me more information. Obviously you’re referring to our energy policy?” The host tells her that’s “what the prime minister calls it”. And it is. But just because something is, doesn’t mean it should be. White-collar crime is the target of new government legislation, based on recommendations from the Asic enforcement review. From Josh Frydenberg’s statement: The Coalition government has introduced legislation into parliament to significantly strengthen criminal and civil penalties for corporate and financial sector misconduct. The legislation will bring our penalties closer to those in other leading jurisdictions and further protect Australian consumers from white-collar crime. Criminal penalties are set to double, from five years to 10 years, in some cases. Civil penalties are due to increase by more than tenfold for corporations and more than fivefold for individuals. For example, if a court currently found a corporation guilty of making false or misleading statements in relation to charging fees for no service, a criminal penalty of up to $210,000 could be imposed. If the breach occurred under the new laws, however, the court could impose a penalty of up to $1.26 million for each offence. In other words, if the corporation is found guilty of making false or misleading statements 25 times, they could face a maximum penalty of $31.5 million. The legislation introduced by the government will also expand the range of contraventions subject to civil penalties as well as give the courts the power to seek additional remedies to strip wrongdoers of profits illegally obtained or losses avoided. For example, if a court currently found a corporation had breached its duty to provide financial services efficiently, honestly and fairly by continuing to deduct insurance premiums from members’ accounts after they have died, there is no penalty apart from taking licensing action. If the breach occurred under the new laws, however, depending on the size of the corporation, it could face a maximum penalty up to $210 million. Happy first anniversary to the Michaelia Cash/AWU raid shitfight estimate hearing. Brendan O’Connor wanted it commemorated. So, exactly one year ago today a cabinet minister told the parliament that her office had not committed criminal offences in leaking information to the media about the AWU raids by the police. We of course now know that her office was completely involved, had in fact committed a criminal offence by leaking that information to the media, which of course risks the lives of the police when you do such things and that is why it is a criminal offence. What we want to know now, given that it was revealed this week in estimates that the police has ended its investigation, thereby removing the defence that Senator Cash has had to not answer questions about her direct involvement and that of other staff in her office about this behaviour. We now need to know from Senator Cash what she knew and to what extent she was involved, and for that matter, what other offices, what other ministers’ offices were involved in this criminal offence. Because what is clear is the AFP has already made comments that not only was Senator Cash’s office involved in their investigation – so too were other ministers’ offices including the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Minister Keenan’s office when he was minister for justice. Now that the Home Affairs estimates has wrapped up, Helen Davidson has complied an update for you on what exactly is going on in Nauru and Manus Island right now. What else we learned Estimates also heard from the department on a number of other recent issues and incidents relating to offshore processing. There are 52 asylum seeker and refugee children left on Nauru, after a plane carrying 11 arrived in Australia while estimates sat. They were all accompanied by their whole family, estimates heard – an apparent change in procedures which have usually seen some family members made to stay behind. There are 15 families split between the two countries, with 30 people on Nauru and 31 in Australia. On Nauru there are now 652 people (sent there by Australia for processing) including: 541 refugees 88 still in the refugee determination process, including seven children 23 failed asylum seekers 107 family units including both adult children and minors The US has resettled 276 people, and formally refused 148. Another 31 are in the final stages of resettlement approval. On Manus Island there are 636 single adult males, including 495 refugees and 131 failed asylum seekers. 146 have been settled in the US. Department in the dark on MSF departure The assistant minister, Linda Reynolds, revealed the department first learned of Nauru kicking Medecins Sans Frontieres off the island through the media. The department boss, Michael Pezzullo, maintained the Nauruan government had grown disappointed with MSF working outside of its reason for being there, which he said was to treat locals. The memorandum of understanding between MSF and Nauru clearly states they would treat locals, refugees and asylum seekers “without discrimination”. Pezzullo said MSF was only supposed to treat refugees if they were referred by Nauruan authorities but also conceded Nauru had not referred a single patient, despite the high level of mental health needs. On Nauru there are 31 Australian government-contracted medical professionals, 34 contracted mental health professionals, and 11 administrative workers. Daintree boat arrival All 17 Vietnamese people whose boat capsized off the Daintree River earlier this year have been returned to Vietnam. Air Vice-Marshal Stephen Osborne refused to say if any of them had claimed asylum, but said their assessment had determined that Australia owed them no protection. He also refused to give details of a “long standing arrangement with Vietnam to return people to Vietnam who have no right to be here”. “Our assessment process meets our domestic and international obligations. Our MOU with Vietnam does likewise in respect to both countries,” said Osborne, who is the commander of the Operation Sovereign Borders joint taskforce. He said Vietnamese authorities were running their own investigation into the boat trip. Canstruct contract extension The Australian government is seeking to extend its contract with Canstruct on Nauru for at least another six months. It expires next week. The extension would have to be approved by Nauru’s Regional Processing Centre Corporation, which the department’s David Nockels described as “the way the [Nauruan] government is managing, from its perspective, the regional processing environment.” “We can contract anybody but for the contractor work in the RPC environment would require the RPCC to say yes to that,” said Nockels. Julie Bishop, fresh from the stage at a national security conference, where she delivered the keynote address, explained why she has been silent on the whole ‘let’s talk about moving our Israel embassy’ issue. I will wait on the Australian government. I don’t think it is fair to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that I should run a commentary on a ... foreign policy change. This is open to any government after a change of leader to reconsider or consider new foreign policy. It’s back to Mathias Cormann v Kristina Keneally in finance estimates. The main battle is over Phil Gaetjens’ appointment as Treasury secretary, despite not submitting a CV. His most recent job before taking up with Treasury was as Scott Morrison’s chief of staff (he had previously worked for Peter Costello). Keneally is asking why he got an $874,000 job without a CV. Cormann won’t let him answer, and instead tells Keneally she is “barking up the wrong tree” and that a public servant working for a minister should not preclude them from a job. Chris Bowen spoke to the ABC about the Master Builders Association’s analysis, pointing out that it neglected to take in the grandfathering of existing negatively geared homes. But he also said the policy could be implemented “even more smoothly” in the existing market (as opposed to when it was created, before the 2016 election). Why? Because investors have already in some instances left the market because they are finding it more difficult to get finance. Now it doesn’t matter what the tax concession is, if you can’t get the finance to start with you are not in the housing market. You can have very generous tax concessions, if the bank won’t lend you the money you’re not buying the house and that is what we are seeing across the board. So what our policy does is make the tax settings fit for purpose going forward. I mean the property market is slowing now, it will quicken at some point and investors will roar back into the market, but we are getting the policy settings right now to ensure that first homebuyers are on a more level playing field. We don’t think it’s right that you get a tax concession for your fifth or sixth house but you get very little support for your first house. We have the most generous property tax concessions in the world bar none, only Australia and New Zealand have this model of negative gearing. Other property markets work quite effectively around the world and this is the right policy. It was designed very carefully and has stood the test of time. I mean I’ve seen all sorts of modelling, all sorts of allegations made. You know I’ve seen allegations that it would see property prices go up, I’ve seen allegations that it would see property prices go down. I’ve seen allegations that it would mean more supply, I’ve seen allegations that it would mean less supply. I’ve seen it all now. A skirmish between Mathias Cormann and Kristina Keneally has livened up the economics estimates hearing. Keneally accused Cormann of “political interference” for talking down her time, and stopping her from asking questions of Treasury staff. Josh Frydenberg was excited by the Master Builders Association’s analysis of Labor’s negative gearing policy though (remembering that Chris Bowen has already said the modelling isn’t of Labor’s actual policy). From his statement: The MBA found that by raising taxes on housing over five years, Labor’s policies could result in up to 42,000 fewer new dwellings being built, 32,000 less full-time jobs and an $11.8 billion drop in building activity. The MBA report joins a growing list of experts saying that Labor’s policies would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy and property market, particularly at a time when the housing marking is softening. RiskWise warned that median house prices in New South Wales and Victoria could fall about 9 per cent, Citi’s research found Labor’s policy could “accelerate the cyclical weaknesses in housing prices” and Standard and Poor’s warned of the consequences of falling house prices on the broader economy. Labor’s property tax will punish not only the 1.3 million Australians who negative gear, but every Australian with equity in their home. Bill Shorten must admit he got this one wrong and ditch his ill-conceived property tax plan. With Australia’s housing market cooling over 12 consecutive months in our capital cities, this is the worst possible time for Labor to push its property tax. The transcripts for the estimates hearings are beginning to filter through. You can find those here. No word on the official government position on this as yet, but Penny Wong has made Labor’s position clear: Labor joins with the G7 Foreign Ministers, of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union in condemning the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the strongest possible terms and calls on Saudi Arabia to now provide a full and proper account of the events leading up to his killing. Labor is deeply disturbed by the evidence, including that presented by Turkey overnight, that Mr Khashoggi was killed as a result of a deliberate, planned and horrific attack by Saudi officials. The Saudi government’s explanations are simply not credible and the world now demands Saudi Arabia tell the truth about the events of 2 October in its Istanbul consulate and bring to account those responsible for the killing of Mr Khashoggi. Freedom of expression and a free press are important values Australia shares with all nations committed to democracy and the rule of law. That is why Labor last week called for Australia to boycott the Riyadh “Future Investment Initiative” (FII) conference. We welcome the government’s decision to support that call and join with our friends and allies in withdrawing official Australian representation at the conference. It is appropriate that as a country we send a strong signal of our concern over Jamal Khashoggi’s murder and our expectation that the government of Saudi Arabia provides a forthright and accurate account of what has occurred.” Richard Di Natale has also called for Australia to cancel its arms deals with Saudi Arabia. There is quite an interesting story in the West Australian this morning. Shane Wright reports the banking regulator is looking at making investment lending “more difficult postcode-by-postcode rather than across the board”. But it also includes this tidbit: The West Australian can also reveal that APRA will not urge the financial services royal commission to back major changes to the laws it administers despite damning findings about its operation. APRA and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission came under fire in the interim report from the commission, with both singled out for failing to take formal legal action against institutions found to be in breach of the law. So that would be Apra saying ‘we don’t need this, everything is cool’. Estimates is still on. That is all I have the energy to say about that right now. Anthony Albanese stopped by doors this morning. It’s fairly rare for him to make an appearance – he is usually doing radio or television – but he stopped by this morning to have a chat about the government’s war on...the government. This is a government that is just looking for things to fight over. Now they are fighting over whether Malcolm Turnbull should attend an oceans conference in Indonesia. This is just pathetic and it comes at a time whereby this is a government that simply doesn’t have policies in key areas. They don’t have an energy policy. What they have is platitudes. Platitudes aren’t policies. Policies are things that change the economy, that drive that change through. I’m not sure those who are continuing the battle against a former prime minister and MP know what it looks like from the outside. Not good is my guess. Scott Morrison looks to be enjoying gelato for breakfast as much as I enjoyed eating my mother’s tuna mornay as a kid. Take that as you will. Scott Morrison is not “done” with Malcolm Turnbull. Allegedly. The Daily Telegraph had a report claiming that after Turnbull declined to campaign in Wentworth (which is basically just following through with what he said he would do if he lost the leadership) Morrison was done with the former prime minister. It also mentioned the anger at Turnbull representing Australia in Bali next week. Morrison had this to say, when asked this morning: Eight weeks ago, when I met with President Widodo, he advised me, and I was aware, that the former prime minister committed to go to the Oceans conference in Bali. This is a very important conference to President Widodo and the Indonesian government. Now I am unable to make that commitment and we discussed the opportunities to see if Mr Turnbull would continue to represent Australia on that occasion. He said he’s departed from partisan politics, but where he is in a position to support the national interest and where he’s in a position to serve his country he always will. And so of course we welcome that, and where we take a decision where he thinks he can do that and where we think we can, we’ll extend such an invitation. Some have made comments about travel, I don’t think Malcolm Turnbull is hanging around looking for a trip to Bali, by the way, the reason he’s going is because he’s been in a position because of his previous relationship with President Widodo to assist our national interest in attending this event. But what about the report? “It’s wrong.” So are you on good terms? “Yes.” I mean, with such stirring words like that, obviously, everything is totally fine. Melissa Price is continuing her stellar run as Australia’s latest environment minister. Fresh from having her travel questioned in estimates overnight, Price was left to defend why, as environment minister, she does not believe lowering emissions should be one of her key priorities. Scott Morrison was asked about whether or not coal-fired power stations were still on the agenda this morning, when he headed to a gelato business before 7am (as you do). Our government is not going to introduce a carbon tax. Only the Labor party is looking at introducing policies that would force the price of electricity up and the best indemnity against higher prices is – don’t vote Labor if you don’t want higher electricity prices. Our government will be acting consistent with getting electricity prices down to encourage and support and facilitate new investment in reliable energy generation around the country. The consultation paper was released yesterday by Angus and he can make further comments on that. We want to see new investment go in and that goes into the issues which will be discussed on Friday which ensures that we’re forcing the companies to contract for more reliable power going into the system further ahead so we can get the reliability and the lights stay on. Stuart Roberts’ internet bill came up in estimates overnight, but there doesn’t seem to have been much new uncovered: Chris Bowen was up VERY early this morning disputing the Master Builders Association’s modelling of Labor’s negative gearing policy, which was first published by the Australian. Some Australians reading the front page of today’s the Australian would be forgiven for thinking the Master Builders Association has modelled Labor’s reforms to negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. It does NOT. This research does NOT model Labor’s reforms to negative gearing – the Master Builders admit themselves that they fail to account for the fact Labor’s policy fully “grandfathers” existing property investments meaning any investment purchases before the start date are protected. Sometimes it can feel like groundhog day as I read the headlines. Today, with energy once again front and centre, feels like one of those days. After yesterday’s promise of “big sticks” and the government saying, once again, it would accept and implement the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s recommendations on energy, we are back to discussing new coal-fired power stations, because, well, the government has put them back on the table. In an interview with Katharine Murphy, Angus Taylor spoke about why: The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has signalled the Australian government could indemnify new power generation projects against the future risk of a carbon price, and says it could also support the retrofitting of existing coal plants. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the man dubbed the “minister for getting power prices down” by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also committed to keeping current subsidies for households and businesses to install renewable energy technology like solar panels until 2030, and insists Australia’s electricity sector will reduce emissions by 26% on 2005 levels in “the early 2020s”. Taylor on Tuesday outlined a range of measures the government wants to implement to help lower power prices, including cajoling retailers into offering customers out-of-cycle price cuts so consumers could experience hip-pocket relief by January, ahead of the next election. He also foreshadowed policy interventions to boost investment in new “reliable” power generation, including providing a floor price, contracts for difference, cap and floor contracts and government loans. Then there is still the fallout from the weekend. Kerryn Phelps was still ahead by just under 1,600 votes last I checked, and while Dave Sharma has just over 50% of the postal votes so far, he would need about 70% of those votes to flow his way to have a hope of winning, and that doesn’t look like happening. But as the final count comes closer, the anger at Malcolm Turnbull, for, well, existing, is growing. Barnaby Joyce, who is just here to help, told 2GB it was outrageous Turnbull didn’t help campaign in Wentworth. And there is growing anger in the Coalition backbench ranks – and One Nation, if that tells you anything – that Turnbull will be representing Australia at next week’s oceans conference in Bali. Despite it being something that Scott Morrison has all but said is to help smooth things over with the Indonesian president. But the backbench heart wants what the backbench heart wants, and the backbench heart is seemingly angry the leadership coup didn’t go entirely the way it planned, and Turnbull is Turnbull – and now comes with his own agency. But it’s energy which is once again dominating all the agendas. We’ll follow the ins and outs of that, as well as anything else that comes up. Mike Bowers and the Guardian Australia brains trust are already on the job. And you know I’ll be lurking in the comments when I get a spare moment, or can be spotted on Twitter at @amyremeikis. It already has the feeling of a four-coffee morning. Ready? Let’s go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/24/labour-tories-copeland-ukip-challenge-stoke","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-24T09:14:47Z","webTitle":"Labour ousted by Tories in Copeland byelection but sees off Ukip in Stoke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/24/labour-tories-copeland-ukip-challenge-stoke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/24/labour-tories-copeland-ukip-challenge-stoke","fields":{"headline":"Labour ousted by Tories in Copeland byelection but sees off Ukip in Stoke","bodyText":"Labour has suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Conservative party in Copeland, a heartland seat dominated by the party since 1935, just half an hour after seeing off the Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, in a bitter battle for Stoke Central. Many Labour MPs were privately blaming Jeremy Corbyn, and in particular his perceived hostility to the nuclear industry, for the loss of the Cumbrian seat, vacated by the resignation of Jamie Reed to work for Sellafield, the nuclear plant that is the biggest local employer. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the result in Copeland was “really disappointing” and the party would “learn lessons”, but he hit out at the former leader Tony Blair for criticising Labour just days before the byelections, and insisted Corbyn had no intention of stepping aside. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, McDonnell said: “There’s mixed views on Jeremy; the issue for me is, actually, he is a different type of leader; he is that sort of person who does listen, is decent and honest and brings people together. He’s not the kind of macho leader we’ve had in the past, and that’s why we’ve had the disasters that we’ve had. He is not someone who doesn’t recognise that our party now needs to rebuild itself from the grassroots in those communities like Copeland.” Labour’s candidate in Copeland, Gillian Troughton, was defeated by the Conservatives’ Trudy Harrison, marking the first time a governing party has taken a seat from another party in a byelection in 35 years. Nuttall’s defeat in Stoke raised doubts about the Ukip leader’s ambition to replace Labour as the voice of the working classes and will leave many questioning the party’s relevance, given that its share of the vote shrank in Copeland. Both results were good news for Theresa May’s Conservative party, which has made a deliberate pitch for traditional Labour voters by focusing on “just about managing” families, and sought to see off Ukip by promising a “red, white and blue Brexit”, prioritising immigration control. Gaining Copeland suggests the Tories could make inroads into areas previously considered safe Labour territory. While the Conservatives could not push Ukip into third place in Stoke, as they had hoped, there was a swing away from Nuttall’s party that benefited the Tories and will boost confidence at No 10 that Ukip can be neutralised. The Ukip leader, who is from Merseyside and admitted he had few links to Stoke, had gambled that the seat was winnable on the basis of the constituency’s 69% leave vote in last year’s EU referendum. But he lost with 5,233 votes to Gareth Snell’s 7,853, leaving the seat vacated by Tristram Hunt in Labour hands. The Conservatives’ Jack Brereton came a close third with 5,154 votes. Turnout was 38% in a seat where both Labour and Ukip had admitted they were battling apathy. In his victory speech, Snell said his win proved Stoke would not allow itself to be defined by the referendum result. “The city lazily dubbed by some as the capital of Brexit has once again proven to the world that we are so much more than that,” he said. “So for those who have come to Stoke-on-Trent to sow hatred and division, and to try to turn us away from our friends and neighbours, I have one message: you have failed,” he said to cheers from Labour activists. Corbyn struck a more sombre note in a statement after the results were declared, heralding the Stoke victory as a “decisive rejection” of Ukip’s values. “But our message was not enough to win through in Copeland,” he said. “In both campaigns, Labour listened to thousands of voters on the doorstep. Both constituencies, like so many in Britain, have been let down by the political establishment. To win power to rebuild and transform Britain, Labour will go further to reconnect with voters, and break with the failed political consensus.” Labour MPs are expected to stay silent despite concerns about Corbyn’s leadership, fearing that a fresh outbreak of infighting would only inflict further damage on the party’s brand. Richard Angell, the director of the centrist Labour pressure group Progress, said: “The Tory gain in Copeland makes the message clear. A hard-left Momentum-led Labour party is more repugnant to the voters than a Tory government closing a local maternity unit and urgent care centre. It is a disaster.” In Copeland, on a turnout of 51%, the Conservatives took 13,748 votes to Labour’s 11,601. The Liberal Democrat candidate, Rebecca Hanson, came third with 2,252 votes. Troughton left the count at Cleveland sports centre within minutes of the result being announced and without making a concession speech. She was heckled by a passerby who shouted “Sack Corbyn!” as she was rushed into a waiting car. Harrison, a political novice, said in her victory speech: “What has happened here tonight is a truly historic event. You would have to go back more than a century to find an example of a governing party taking a seat from the opposition party in an election like this. “We have had Labour here for more than 80 years but it has been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t represent them. “They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum, and which will build a country which represents everyone. That’s why they voted for me tonight.” Labour was battling to save a slim 2,564 majority left by Reed, an outspoken Corbyn critic who quit to take a job at the local Sellafield nuclear decommissioning plant. Tory campaigners made much of an ITV Borders television interview by Corbyn at the end of January in which he failed four times to say he supported Moorside, a multibillion-pound nuclear plant planned to be built next to Sellafield. Labour’s campaign focused heavily on Tory-backed plans to close the maternity unit at the new West Cumberland hospital, meaning the nearest service will be an hour-long drive away in Carlisle. Troughton, a borough councillor, retired doctor and St John Ambulance driver who voted against Corbyn in the last leadership contest, consistently claimed the hospital was the “number one issue on the doorstep”. Speaking after the result, Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish who ran Troughton’s campaign, conceded that the party “struggled to convince” voters that it backs nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/03/labour-explores-alliance-with-lib-dems-and-greens-in-stoke","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-03T19:04:56Z","webTitle":"Labour looks at collaborating with Lib Dems and Greens in Stoke","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/03/labour-explores-alliance-with-lib-dems-and-greens-in-stoke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/03/labour-explores-alliance-with-lib-dems-and-greens-in-stoke","fields":{"headline":"Labour looks at collaborating with Lib Dems and Greens in Stoke","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn’s team have informally explored the idea of collaborating with the Greens and Liberal Democrats in Stoke-on-Trent Central to keep Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, out of parliament. A senior figure in the Labour leader’s office has asked a go-between what it would take to persuade the Lib Dems and Greens to dial down their campaigns, or even withdraw candidates, in the byelection later this month, the Guardian understands. The contest, which will be held on 23 February, was triggered by the resignation of Labour MP Tristram Hunt, a trenchant critic of Corbyn’s leadership, to run the Victoria &amp; Albert museum in London. He had a majority of just over 5,000 in the 2015 general election, but Ukip came second, just a few votes ahead of the Conservatives. It is understood that Labour officials have not had any direct contact with other political parties over the issue. Labour sources subsequently insisted the individual in question had been acting without the approval of the leader. A Labour spokesperson said: “It’s untrue that Jeremy Corbyn’s team or the Labour Party have been exploring collaborating with other parties in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by election, informally or otherwise.” The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, has made clear he has no intention of forming a “progressive alliance” with Corbyn, who has infuriated some pro-remain voters by whipping his party to back the government’s article 50 bill. Farron told the Guardian recently he believed Corbyn was “electorally toxic” and “on the wrong side of the argument from a progressive point of view on the biggest issue of the day.” Local Lib Dem leaflets attack Labour, and Corbyn’s leadership. But other senior Lib Dems, and Greens, would like to see their parties step aside to minimise the chance that Nuttall, Ukip’s new leader, gains a valuable platform in the House of Commons. The Greens threw their weight behind the Lib Dem candidate, Sarah Olney, in the recent Richmond Park byelection, and she went on to win the seat. Two prominent Labour MPs, Lisa Nandy and Clive Lewis, called on Labour not to field a candidate then, but the party hierarchy disagreed. Green co-leader Caroline Lucas has made building up a progressive alliance a key aim of her party, and edited a book with Nandy and Lib Dem Chris Bowers, which examined the idea of holding open primaries to decide which left-of-centre candidate would be best equipped to challenge the Tories in each seat. The former Lib Dem MP Andrew George admitted that Stoke posed a difficult question, but said it was important to remember that his party came fourth in the seat in the last election. “If there really was a chance of us pulling off a remarkable result then we should give it our all,” he said. “However, we should also be careful that, in our enthusiasm, we don’t unintentionally help elect a thinly disguised fascist to parliament. “The Regressive Alliance, between the Tories and Ukip, is in rude health – in Stoke, just as it was at Richmond Park.” George admitted that it was hard to cooperate with a Labour party that lacked “credibility and competence”. But he said his party must avoid the risk of helping open a door to the “extreme right”. Labour has traditionally fought hard against the Lib Dems at local level; but Corbyn’s leadership, which has attracted hundreds of thousands of new members to the party, may be more open to cooperation with other left-of-centre groups. The Greens would be likely to demand assurances from the Labour leadership about closer coordination in the runup to the 2020 general election in exchange for soft-pedalling in the campaign — though the local party makes the final decision, and has already selected a candidate, Adam Colcough. Nuttall has emphasised his determination to take on Labour among working-class voters in its traditional heartlands, by focusing on issues such as jobs and living standards. Labour’s candidate, Gareth Snell, is a former local councillor who, unlike Nuttall, has lived locally for more than a decade. Nuttall is being investigated by the police over claims that he registered his candidacy using an address that he has only since moved into. Electoral experts point out that Labour should be in a strong position to win the seat, without the support of other left-of-centre parties, so the fact that Corbyn’s team are considering asking them to step aside underlines the anxieties in Labour headquarters about a series of tough electoral tests. The Lib Dems and the Greens scored only just over 1,000 votes each, compared with Labour’s 12,000. Stephen Fisher, of Oxford University, said Corbyn’s insistence on respecting the result of the referendum might help Labour. “Brexit is not under threat from the Labour party and leavers generally are not desperate to re-voice their leave views in elections. (Remainers are sometimes.) On the other hand, it should be easy for Labour to mobilise anti-austerity and pro-NHS sentiment in Stoke.” He added that while Corbyn’s party had been performing poorly in opinion polls, it should not be nearly enough to lose them the seat. “If the result reflects the national movement in the polls, then the Labour to Ukip or even the bigger Labour to Conservative swings in the polls nationally are nowhere near big enough to suggest Labour should lose.” Another potentially challenging byelection is being held on the same day, in the Cumbrian seat of Copeland, where Jamie Reed stepped down to work for Sellafield. The Tories in the local area have been stressing Corbyn’s ambivalence about nuclear power. Separately, campaign group More United, which was co-founded by Lord Ashdown, convened a meeting earlier this week to discuss making financial backing available to whichever candidate is willing to sign up to a series of progressive principles, including seeking to retain a close relationship with the EU. The Guardian understands that a senior Labour figure attended. More United Olney in Richmond Park, but has not ruled out making its support available to Labour in Stoke."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/aug/19/beijing-decries-china-phobia-after-britain-cools-on-hinkley-point-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-19T04:28:35Z","webTitle":"Beijing decries 'China-phobia' after Britain cools on Hinkley Point nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/19/beijing-decries-china-phobia-after-britain-cools-on-hinkley-point-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/aug/19/beijing-decries-china-phobia-after-britain-cools-on-hinkley-point-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"Beijing decries 'China-phobia' after Britain cools on Hinkley Point nuclear deal","bodyText":"Britain would be foolish to turn its back on the “golden era” of relations with China, Beijing’s official news agency has claimed, dismissing concerns over Chinese involvement in the Hinkley Point nuclear project as “China-phobia”. Since becoming Prime Minister last month Theresa May has stepped back from David Cameron and George Osborne’s energetic and controversial courtship of China, infuriating Beijing by postponing a final decision on the approval of the proposed £18bn ($23.5bn) nuclear power station. In a letter to Chinese president Xi Jinping this week, May said she looked forward to “strengthening cooperation with China on trade and business and on global issues” and confirmed she would attend the G20 summit being hosted by the Chinese city of Hangzhou on 4-5 September. A Downing Street source told the Guardian the letter was intended to reassure Beijing “of our commitment to Anglo-Chinese relations”. However, May and her advisers are believed to have misgivings about the closeness to Beijing that developed under her Conservative party predecessor. Writing last October, May’s influential joint chief-of-staff, Nick Timothy, questioned the wisdom of the so-called “golden” relationship negotiated by Cameron and Xi. In an article for the Conservative Home website, Timothy claimed Beijing was using economic opportunities to buy Britain’s silence over human rights abuses and said it was “baffling” that China would be allowed to play a role in such sensitive sectors as energy and communications. In an English-language op-ed published this week, Xinhua said the reassurances in May’s letter over Britain’s continued commitment to the “golden era” was “a laudable move in the right direction”. However, the Communist party controlled news agency hinted that future commercial opportunities with China would depend on approval of the Hinkley Point project, a final decision on which is now scheduled for the autumn. “After divorcing the EU, Britain would be foolish to decline stronger trade ties with China, whose markets remain home to tremendous business opportunities,” argued the article, which was penned by journalist Zhu Junqing. “The worries over the plant are as groundless as they are unnecessary,” the article added, claiming it would be “commercially suicidal” for China to use the project to damage Britain’s national security. “London’s misgivings over Chinese involvement in its key infrastructure is yet another stroke of China-phobia,” Xinhua claimed. During a trip to China this week, Alok Sharma, the UK’s minister for Asia and the Pacific, said Britain’s relationship with China was “strong, growing and delivering benefits for both our countries”. However, the word “golden” was notably absent from Sharma’s statements. Earlier this month Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, said ties between the two nations had reached a “crucial historical juncture” in the wake of the Hinkley Point postponement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/aug/19/business-chiefs-attack-uk-government-failure-to-secure-energy-supply","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-18T23:01:01Z","webTitle":"Business chiefs attack UK government failure to secure energy supply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/19/business-chiefs-attack-uk-government-failure-to-secure-energy-supply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/19/business-chiefs-attack-uk-government-failure-to-secure-energy-supply","fields":{"headline":"Business chiefs attack UK government failure to secure energy supply","bodyText":"The Institute of Directors (IoD) has backed Theresa May’s decision to review the £18.5bn Hinkley nuclear scheme but launched a savage attack on successive government policies for failing to deliver energy security. The traditionally conservative employers group also released an opinion poll showing three-quarters of its members supported action to counter climate change with strong backing for solar, wind, and even tidal power. Only 9% of the 1,000 bosses “strongly agreed” that the proposed new reactors at Hinkley Point C would make Britain more economically competitive. Less than a fifth strongly believed Hinkley would make the UK more strategically secure although a different poll taken 12 months ago showed a huge majority in general favour of new nuclear power stations being constructed. “The IoD backs nuclear as a reliable source of low-carbon energy, but each project has to make economic sense. Hinkley Point C would generate reliable power for 5m homes, but given the costs, the government is right to take one final look before signing off,” said Dan Lewis, senior infrastructure policy adviser at the IoD. However, Lewis attacked ministers of all parties for focusing on reducing carbon emissions but underplaying the other two “crucial aims of energy policy”, delivering secure and affordable power. “Government policy at the moment is creating all sorts of bizarre outcomes. Instead of accelerating moves to safely frack for gas and oil in the UK, we are importing coal and oil from Russia, and gas and oil from Norway, with the extra costs and emissions that involves. “Instead of building cleaner gas plants to meet demand when renewables can’t, the government has been subsidising more polluting diesel-fired plants,” he added. The IoD survey shows members are split over shale exploration with only 53% strongly or somewhat in favour with nearly 30% strongly or somewhat opposed. Around 14% of those surveyed neither supported nor opposed fracking, while a very high 53% strongly supported solar arrays, with 45% similarly in favour of offshore wind and 57% behind wave and tidal, neither of which have been tested at scale in Britain. Hinkley has been put under new scrutiny following the EU referendum and decision by David Cameron to quit as prime minister. A final decision by new business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, is expected next month. EDF, the French promoter of the scheme, took a final investment decision to proceed with the Somerset project after a raft of delays but Hinkley’s many critics believe the scheme is too expensive. A previous government agreed to pay EDF a guaranteed price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for the 35-year duration of the scheme, even though the current cost of wholesale electricity is half that figure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/dec/13/len-mccluskey-too-busy-running-labour-says-unite-leadership-rival","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-13T13:00:45Z","webTitle":"McCluskey too focused on Labour party, says Unite leadership rival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/13/len-mccluskey-too-busy-running-labour-says-unite-leadership-rival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/dec/13/len-mccluskey-too-busy-running-labour-says-unite-leadership-rival","fields":{"headline":"McCluskey too focused on Labour party, says Unite leadership rival","bodyText":"Len McCluskey is “dabbling in politics all the time” and focused on the Labour party instead of running Unite, according to a rival who hopes to become the new head of Britain’s most powerful union. Gerard Coyne, the regional secretary from the West Midlands, has declared he will stand against McCluskey, who is seeking a third term as leader. During a speech setting out his leadership campaign at an event in Birmingham on Tuesday, Coyne said the “time is right for change” at the top as he vowed that his primary focus would be Unite’s 1.4 million members. “Unite has become too much of a political commentator and not actually focusing on the concerns of our membership,” he told journalists at the city’s landmark Fort Dunlop building. “The reality here is there’s been much criticism about the fact that the general secretary and the union more generally has just been dabbling in politics all the time.” Coyne’s official declaration draws up the battle lines for a contest that could also dictate the future of Labour. Questioned by reporters, Coyne refused to be drawn on whether he would maintain support for Jeremy Corbyn if he won. McCluskey triggered a leadership contest last week by giving notice of his resignation, then immediately announced he would be standing for a third term. The month-long election will take place in the spring, with the result announced on 28 April. Coyne hopes to win the support of members concerned by Corbyn’s anti-Trident stance, given that thousands of Unite members work in the defence industry, as well as those worried about work in the car industry, after reports suggested that the Labour leader was considering advocating a ban on petrol cars. Corbyn’s allies see the challenge as another attempt to undermine the Labour leader. A senior source close to Corbyn said it was backed by “enemies within the party” but added that McCluskey would win. “He has support where it matters. This is a key battle for the party,” the source said. In an article for the Guardian, Coyne makes a direct appeal to ordinary union members, saying they are the ones whose views he wishes to represent. “Under my leadership, Unite would be a more flexible, responsive and transparent union for all our members,” he said. “Often, they are people who don’t feel ‘political’, even if they are affected by political events. I believe they want a general secretary who spends less time trying to run the Labour party and more time looking after their interests.” Coyne also made comments that will be seen as a criticism of McCluskey over the use of £400,000 of union funds to help him buy a £700,000 flat near Borough Market in south London. “All too often, members feel the leadership of their union is too remote and out of touch and they get angry and disillusioned when they read about allegations of inappropriate uses of union money. That has to change,” Coyne said. The union has said the money was part an equity share arrangement commonly used to help general secretaries buy homes in London, and insisted the deal would raise more money for its members when the flat was eventually sold. Coyne, the son of union activists who has been regional secretary for 15 years and a Unite member for 28, said he would continue to campaign for a Labour government but would prioritise pay deals. “I passionately believe Unite members would be better off under a Labour government and I will continue to work with anyone to bring that about,” he said. “But I also understand that most of those members want their union officials to concentrate on negotiating pay deals rather than playing at politics.” McCluskey was elected general secretary in November 2010, shortly after Ed Miliband became the Labour leader. He was re-elected in 2013 for a five-year term and if he wins a new mandate it would authorise him to continue to support Corbyn’s leadership. Unite has 1.4 million members and has given millions of pounds to the party. McCluskey’s decision to force a new election will be seen by some as a gamble because some Unite members are concerned by Corbyn’s support for a ban on fracking and his lukewarm support for nuclear power. However, McCluskey has a high profile, which has been carefully nurtured this year to appeal to the mainly leftwing activists who tend to vote in Unite elections. McCluskey’s five-year term was to end in 2018 so he has effectively brought the election forward a year. The 66-year-old would have come under pressure to retire if he had stayed until the end of the scheduled term. A Militant sympathiser in the 1980s, McCluskey was national secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union before becoming assistant general secretary of Unite, formed from a merger of the TGWU and Amicus. Despite Coyne’s support from Labour’s parliamentary party and large sections of the union movement, McCluskey is still seen by many as the favourite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2016/jun/07/liberals-recruit-john-howard-to-protect-seat-from-nick-xenophon-team","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-07T01:18:19Z","webTitle":"Liberals recruit John Howard to protect seat from Nick Xenophon Team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/07/liberals-recruit-john-howard-to-protect-seat-from-nick-xenophon-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2016/jun/07/liberals-recruit-john-howard-to-protect-seat-from-nick-xenophon-team","fields":{"headline":"Liberals recruit John Howard to protect seat from Nick Xenophon Team","bodyText":"John Howard is campaigning with the Liberal MP Jamie Briggs in his South Australian seat of Mayo, in a sign the Liberals are increasingly concerned the safe seat could fall due to the rise of the Nick Xenophon Team. Malcolm Turnbull campaigned with Briggs on Monday and Howard is campaigning in Mayo on Tuesday after a ReachTEL poll suggested the Nick Xenophon Team could capture the seat. Briggs resigned from the frontbench in December after admitting he behaved inappropriately towards a female diplomatic staffer. Speaking on 5AA with David Penbarthy, Howard said Nick Xenophon “had a view on everything” but noted “you’ve really got to declare yourself, you can’t have it both ways – you can’t have the purity of abstinent independence but have a view on everything”. Howard agreed there were parallels between Pauline Hanson and Xenophon, including a “common element of dissent”. “Some of the issues that Pauline Hanson talked about, Nick Xenophon talks about,” Howard said. “Certainly [he is] trying to whip up concern about free-trade agreements.” Howard credited his government’s fiscal performance and trade deals with north Asian countries for Australia getting through the global financial crisis without falling into recession. “How anybody would pussyfoot about supporting these agreements is beyond me,” he said. Asked whether he was melancholy Tony Abbott was no longer the prime minister, Howard said: “I campaign for a Liberal government – for the rest of my life I stand for the Liberal cause”. Howard said Abbott was and is a good friend but he accepted the Liberal party room’s decision to make Turnbull prime minister. “I know Malcolm Turnbull well,” Howard said. “I’ve known him for a long time on a friendship basis – not as close as I was to Tony [Abbott] but there was never any real hostility between us, notwithstanding our celebrated differences on such things as Australia becoming a republic.” Howard said Turnbull understood the economy and “made a huge success of being in business”. “Isn’t it better to have that person in charge than a man who says he’ll govern like a trade union leader?” he said. Howard praised the Turnbull government’s decision to build submarines in South Australia. He said the royal commission report into the nuclear industry “made a lot of sense” and could provide South Australia with a new industry. “I don’t think quite enough has changed – there’s still a lot of irrational fear in the community about that ... in the long run nuclear power is part of our energy future,” he said. “The truth is if you need baseload power you need fossil fuels or nuclear power. You’re not going to get baseload power from other sources.” Howard said “what the public wants is a bit of stability” and “there’s really only one bloke to vote for and that’s Turnbull”. Asked whether he itched to return to politics, Howard noted the public had called time on his government when he was 68 and he had supported every Liberal leader since. Responding to Howard’s comments Xenophon said: “At a personal level I’ve always liked John Howard and I’m very grateful that he’s given the Nick Xenophon Team so much oxygen in South Australia with his attack. “Deep down I think he must really like me, as evidenced by his comments on me following the 2013 election. “Free-trade agreements are a good thing if they are negotiated with our national economic interest in mind. The fact that the trade deficit with China has increased at 15% a year since the Howard-era FTA says it all.” The ReachTEL poll released on Friday showed the Nick Xenophon Team had a primary vote of 23.5% in Mayo and 21.3% in Sturt. In Mayo the Liberals’ primary vote was below 40%, suggesting Xenophon’s candidate, Rebekha Sharkie, could capture the seat on preferences. On Monday Newspoll suggested the Greens and independents were poised to capture 25% of the vote nation-wide, including 3% for the Nick Xenophon Team. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, was also campaigning in Adelaide on Monday on Labor’s plan to boost apprentices on government projects. On ABC radio, Shorten was asked about Xenophon’s popularity. He said people were frustrated with the Liberals and although Labor would seek their votes “in the meantime people may decide they may want to vote for a third party”. “One thing I don’t ever do is blame voters,” he said. “I accept that there’s things I can control and the things I can’t. What I can control is how Labor presents its views and do our ideas actually make a real difference in people’s lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/mar/11/japan-fifth-anniversary-tsunami-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-11T08:49:57Z","webTitle":"Japan marks fifth anniversary of tsunami and nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/japan-fifth-anniversary-tsunami-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/mar/11/japan-fifth-anniversary-tsunami-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Japan marks fifth anniversary of tsunami and nuclear disaster","bodyText":"Japan’s emperor has led tributes to the 19,000 people who died five years ago when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the country’s north-east coast and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Across the devastated region, people observed a moment’s silence at 2.46pm on Friday, the exact moment in 2011 when a magnitude-9 earthquake – the biggest in Japan’s recorded history – unleashed a tsunami that engulfed entire towns and villages. Temple bells rang out in Tokyo, and all trains on the city’s underground network came to a halt. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, and the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, joined survivors in the capital to remember the dead and encourage survivors as they continue to rebuild their shattered communities. “Many of the people affected by the disaster are ageing, and I worry that some of them may be suffering alone in places where our eyes and attention don’t reach,” the emperor told an audience of 1,200 people. “It is important that all the people keep their hearts together so that not a single person still in difficulty is overlooked and they can return to normal life as soon as possible.” Abe acknowledged that many people were still struggling, but he said: “Reconstruction is steadily making progress, step by step, with housing being rebuilt and jobs regained.” He added: “Many people are still leading uncomfortable lives in the affected areas. There are many who cannot return to their beloved homes because of the accident at the nuclear power plant. “We commit ourselves to providing care for their minds and bodies, forming new local communities and supporting industrial development of the affected areas.” Masakiyo Kimura, whose parents were killed in the coastal town of Onagawa, said at the ceremony: “Father, that day, I called your mobile phone so many times, but you didn’t answer. “Our house was completely torn from its foundation. Nothing remained except for the pair of matching teacups my father and mother used, lying on top of each other.” Millions of tonnes of tsunami debris have been cleared to make way for new developments, but for many survivors life has barely moved on. More than 180,000 people from the three worst-hit prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima are still displaced, a third of them living in tiny prefabricated units that were supposed to have been vacated two years after the disaster. In Fukushima, where the meltdown sparked huge radiation leaks in the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, more than 100,000 people are still unable to return home. From early morning on Friday, small groups of survivors gathered to pay tribute to dead family members, friends and colleagues. Some held hands and shed tears as they bowed their heads and remembered the victims of Japan’s worst disaster since the second world war. Many families are still waiting for the chance to properly mourn, as police and coastguard divers recently resumed the search for more than 2,500 people still listed as missing. In the town of Minamisanriku, people gathered near the gutted frame of a former disaster prevention centre where 43 people died. “Although I know I have to accept reality, these five years have been tough,” Ryuji Kawahara, whose cousin’s body has never been found, told Kyodo News. The pain of bereavement was evident among residents in Rikuzentakata, where the tsunami killed more than 1,700 people and flattened the coastal district. “The reality is that we still feel the scars here, and there are still many struggling to restart their lives,” said Yashichi Yanashita, a retired civil servant. The slow pace of recovery throughout the region is taking a physical toll on the many elderly people who live in temporary housing. According to local authorities, by September last year 3,410 people had died from illnesses and in suicides linked to the triple disaster. Nuclear evacuees who have relocated to Tokyo said they feared their plight was being forgotten. “I hope people will remember us, that lives of evacuees are still difficult in many ways, including financially,” Kazuko Nihei said at a memorial service in the city. Abe pledged to speed up the reconstruction effort in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, after his cabinet approved a new 6.5 trillion yen (£40bn), five-year reconstruction plan that will prioritise public housing, medical care, infrastructure and tourism. So far, local governments say only about half of 29,000 planned public housing units for evacuees have been built. In Fukushima, 40 communities have yet to be decontaminated, casting doubt on a government pledge to lift evacuation orders by next March in all of the affected towns and villages apart those closest to the stricken power plant. While most Japanese remain opposed to the restart of reactors closed in the wake of the meltdown as part of a new safety regime, the Abe administration is pushing for a bigger role for nuclear energy. The government said last year it would aim for nuclear to account for about 20% of the country’s energy mix by 2020. On the eve of the anniversary, Abe insisted Japan must embrace nuclear power to honour its climate change commitments and lessen its dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports. “Our resource-poor country cannot do without nuclear power to secure the stability of energy supply, while considering what makes economic sense and the issue of climate change,” he said. His comments came a day after a Japanese court ordered the shutdown of two nuclear reactors that had been declared safe to go back online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/dec/06/len-mccluskey-resigns-unite-general-secretary-run-again-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-06T18:17:05Z","webTitle":"Len McCluskey resigns as head of Unite but will run again for leadership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/len-mccluskey-resigns-unite-general-secretary-run-again-leadership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/dec/06/len-mccluskey-resigns-unite-general-secretary-run-again-leadership","fields":{"headline":"Len McCluskey resigns as head of Unite but will run again for leadership","bodyText":"Len McCluskey, the head of Britain’s biggest union, has resigned, but will stand again in the ensuing leadership contest, triggering a fight for control of Labour’s most generous donor. The head of Unite announced on Tuesday he would try to win a third term in office after days of speculation over his future. The decision is a gamble by McCluskey and his supporters to maintain control of the union and its influence over the Labour party. Unite has 1.4 million members and has given millions of pounds to the party. Gerard Coyne, Unite’s regional secretary for the West Midlands, is expected to stand against McCluskey. His supporters say there is “everything to play for”. McCluskey’s current five-year term is to end in 2018, so he is effectively bringing the election forward a year. The 66-year-old would have come under pressure to retire if he had stayed until the end of the scheduled term. Coyne, a relative centrist in a union whose activists are dominated by leftwingers, will be backed by many in the parliamentary Labour party who were angered by McCluskey this summer. During the attempt to force Jeremy Corbyn to stand down as Labour leader, McCluskey issued veiled threats to deselect some MPs, whom he called “traitors”. Unite continues to exert influence within Labour by funding Corbyn’s office and MPs’ offices, and votes on the national executive committee and on key policy decisions. Many believe that McCluskey had a crucial role in persuading Corbyn, a lifelong unilateralist, to allow the parliamentary party a free vote on the renewal of Trident. Unite has many members who work in the nuclear sector. In a statement issued through the union, McCluskey said: “I intend to be a candidate in the upcoming general secretary election and to submit my record to the vote of Unite members. This will be an election in which Unite will be under unprecedented scrutiny, particularly from our enemies. “It is vital that in this period there is no lack of continuity in service or support to our membership, and that the full integrity of our procedures is not only protected, but seen to be protected.” The current assistant general secretary, Gail Cartmail, will act as leader for the election period, a move McCluskey said would ensure “that, while I am a candidate for re-election, the business of Unite remains properly managed”. The timetable was agreed by Unite’s executive on Tuesday. Balloting will start in March and end on 28 April. McCluskey’s influence and the union’s money have been crucial in winning the Labour leadership for Corbyn and supporting him for 15 months. McCluskey was elected as general secretary in November 2010, a few months after Ed Miliband became Labour leader. He was re-elected in 2013 for a five-year term, but if he wins a new mandate, it would authorise him to continue his support for Corbyn’s leadership. McCluskey’s decision to resign will be seen as a gamble in some quarters because some members remain concerned by Corbyn’s support for a ban on fracking and his lukewarm support for nuclear power. However, the union leader has a high profile, which has been carefully nurtured this year to appeal to the mainly leftwing activists who tend to vote in Unite elections. A Militant sympathiser in the 1980s, McCluskey was national secretary of the Transport and General Workers’ Union and became assistant general secretary of Unite, formed from a merger of the TGWU and Amicus. He was criticised by some council members after the Guardian disclosed that the union had helped him to buy a £700,000 flat near Borough Market in south London. Coyne, who was born in West Bromwich and is the son of a fire brigades union activist, is expected to announce his candidacy on Wednesday. He will promise to focus on returning the union to its members – a tactic that will be seen as a way of highlighting McCluskey’s alleged preoccupation with the Labour party. One Coyne supporter said: “He will be standing on a ticket of devoting his time to the job of general secretary to Unite. The current incumbent seems to be spending more time as general secretary of the Labour party.” A new union faction calling itself Unite Alliance hopes to take up positions on the executive council next year, according to the group’s website. Unite Alliance’s website calls on Unite’s members to recognise that McCluskey has done a good job. It said: “We are fortunate to currently have a general secretary in Len McCluskey who always has and always will have members’ best interests at heart and who truly believes in a ‘fighting back union’.” The announcement follows days of denials and unanswered questions to Unite officials and press officers. Asked last week by PoliticsHome website if he had plans to call an early election, McCluskey said: “I don’t think so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/dec/26/a-brexit-byelection-strategy-for-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-26T17:02:08Z","webTitle":"A Brexit byelection strategy for Labour | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/26/a-brexit-byelection-strategy-for-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/dec/26/a-brexit-byelection-strategy-for-labour","fields":{"headline":"A Brexit byelection strategy for Labour","bodyText":"Far more important than Jamie Reid’s motives for resigning (by their exit strategies shall ye know them…) is the upcoming bellwether contest in his Copeland seat – a first acid test of Labour’s post-referendum prospects in a “Labour-leave” seat (Corbyn critic quits and triggers election test for Labour, 22 December). Labour’s chances will stand or fall on the party’s ability to articulate – finally – a position on Brexit that’s both principled and comprehensible. Something like: “We believed in June, and still believe today, that leaving the EU is a disastrous choice for Britain. We make no apologies for that conviction. But we acknowledge the outcome of the referendum. And precisely because we hold the convictions we do, you can trust us to fight for the best possible deal for Brexit – one that protects jobs, will not sell out workers’ and consumers’ rights or the environment, and recognises that Britain’s prosperity depends on amicable relations with our fellow Europeans – our closest neighbours, our historic allies and our biggest trading partners. We understand how much uncontrolled immigration concerns voters and we will put forward a policy that is humane and realistic”. Voters – even those who don’t agree with every sentiment – will reward clarity and honesty, just as they will punish (continuing) incoherence and evasiveness. Furthermore, provided Labour don’t select a leave candidate – a suicidal and self-defeating choice which would reap absolutely no electoral dividend – those centre-left voices calling for a progressive alliance must renew our call for unity among anti-Tory, anti-Ukip, anti-hard-Brexit forces. By choosing not to field a candidate in a contest where they stand no chance, the Lib Dems can demonstrate greater political maturity than Labour did with their futile candidacy in Richmond Park last month. For the Green party this will be more difficult, given their opposition to nuclear power and the certainty of a pro-nuclear Labour candidate. But the far bigger prize of holding down May’s majority should be worth swallowing even that bitter pill. Professor Barry Langford Royal Holloway, University of London • Steve Richards argues persuasively for “taking back control” being a slogan for the left (Opinion, 20 December), but there is a great flaw at the heart of his case: there is no practical definition of the “left” that is today capable of supporting his case. Labour, in its belief that it owned the left, relied on that massive bloc of voters that identified itself by class, trade union membership or employment, and automatically voted for the party. As a group those voters have gone. Heavy industry has all but disappeared, the unions, faced with adverse economic conditions, cannot preserve jobs and are themselves struggling; and class solidarity is drifting increasingly towards identification with rightwing parties, primarily Ukip or, as most vividly in Scotland, with nationalist parties. This misalignment of Labour’s core voters with the party’s views is far from being new, but Labour took their votes for granted until it was too late. Now there is the great paradox that these electors want low prices, but reject the dependence on imports from lower-wage economies overseas, or from the employment of new immigrants. It is similar to deploring the disappearance of the corner shop, but steadfastly shopping at the supermarket. The “right”, whether Ukip or even much of the Conservative party, can mouth slogans, but their world is a chimera and their appeal is fraudulent. The past, as this swathe of good, solid citizens remembers it, has gone and cannot return in the same form. What is needed is a commitment to long-term support for different but worthwhile jobs, for domestic policies that provide the basis for rebuilding local communities, and for an emphasis on human values that do not depend on high earning. It is not easy to combat selfishness – particularly when a few earn shamefully high salaries while average wages decline in real terms – but there is no stability nor worthwhile future if we do not succeed. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds • As a Christmas present to Jeremy Corbyn’s critics, you headline a report from a group of Labour MPs hostile to Corbyn, rightwingers you refer to as “moderates” (‘No passion’ – swing voters’ damning verdict on Corbyn and Labour party, 24 December). The report is based on focus groups of Ukip sympathisers and – surprise, surprise – advises those same MPs to “isolate from Jeremy”. Just what they want to hear. You then repeat playground insults from the same source. Any disarray or disunity in the party is the responsibility of those MPs. They attack Corbyn and John McDonnell day after day, refusing to promote party policy on jobs, housing, transport or the NHS, the core concerns of those they should represent. They offer no support, in parliament or outside. Worst of all, they show contempt for the hundreds of thousands of new members, mainly Corbyn supporters, who have made Labour the largest political party in Europe. This bunch of political losers are intent on the destruction of a Labour party they cannot control.

But not so fast. There is also a new, strange form of denial that has appeared on the landscape of late, one that says that renewable sources can’t meet our energy needs. Oddly, some of these voices include climate scientists, who insist that we must now turn to wholesale expansion of nuclear power. Just this past week, as negotiators were closing in on the Paris agreement, four climate scientists held an off-site session insisting that the only way we can solve the coupled climate/energy problem is with a massive and immediate expansion of nuclear power. More than that, they are blaming environmentalists, suggesting that the opposition to nuclear power stands between all of us and a two-degree world. That would have troubling consequences for climate change if it were true, but it is not. Numerous high quality studies, including one recently published by Mark Jacobson of Stanford University, show that this isn’t so. We can transition to a decarbonized economy without expanded nuclear power, by focusing on wind, water and solar, coupled with grid integration, energy efficiency and demand management. In fact, our best studies show that we can do it faster, and more cheaply. The reason is simple: experience shows that nuclear power is slow to build, expensive to run and carries the spectre of catastrophic risk. It requires technical expertise and organization that is lacking in many parts of the developing world (and in some part of the developed world as well). As one of my scientific colleagues once put it, nuclear power is an extraordinarily elaborate and expensive way to boil water. The only country in the world that has ever produced the lion’s share of its electricity from nuclear is France, and they’ve done it in a fully nationalized industry – a model that is unlikely to be transferable to the US, particularly in our current political climate. Even in the US, where nuclear power is generated in the private sector, it has been hugely subsidized by the federal government, which invested billions in its development in order to prove that the destructive power unleashed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki could be put to good use. The government also indemnified the industry from accidents, and took on the task of waste disposal – a task it has yet to complete. We also have to pay attention to the problem of continued fossil fuel development. Climate activists have focused attention on divestment as a means to remind the world that continued investment in new fossil fuel infrastructure is inconsistent with the decarbonized economy that we need. And here, there are some interesting facts that most people don’t know. In a recent study that I did with my colleague Richard Heede, we examined the potential impact of using the proven reserves of fossil fuels in the world. We discovered a surprising fact: if all the reserves in the hands of investor-owned companies were to be burned, we would not exceed the 2C (3.6F) target. What puts the world at risk are the reserves in the hands of nation-states – which are mostly coal – and the continued exploration for more oil and gas by private companies like Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, BP and Shell. Most of the coal reserves are in developing nations such as China, which increasingly recognizes the very serious damage that coal use entails and is looking for alternatives modes of development. So this leaves us with the investor-owned companies seeking new reserves, and it means that we must find a way to convince – or prevent – these companies from continued exploration. So far no one has proposed a plan to do that, and we probably won’t get very far if the alternatives to fossil fuel – such as renewable energy – are disparaged by a new generation of myths. If we want to see real solutions implemented, we need to be on the lookout for this new form of denial. There have been important signs of late of cracks in the Republican rejection of climate science, as some party leaders have signaled their willingness to consider carbon pricing. Still, as new forms of denialism continue to emerge, it is hard to imagine federal implementation of a climate plan any time soon, much less the sort of ambitious plan that would help keep the world below the 1.5-2C (2.7-3.6F) level of warming, per the Paris agreement. When President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, many critics of the decision (and even some supporters) said it was merely symbolic. Symbols matter – so even if it were, that would not necessarily be bad. But rejecting XL was a crucial step in the direction of rejecting new commitments to fossil fuel infrastructure. The key to decarbonizing our economy is to build a new energy system that does not rely on carbon-based fuels. Scientific studies show that that can be done, it can be done soon and it does not require nuclear power. This article was amended on 16 December 2015. An earlier version of the piece argued against investment in new fossil fuel corporations, instead of infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/27/non-nuclear-options-for-constant-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-27T17:48:16Z","webTitle":"Non-nuclear options for constant energy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/non-nuclear-options-for-constant-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/27/non-nuclear-options-for-constant-energy","fields":{"headline":"Non-nuclear options for constant energy","bodyText":"Energy secretary Amber Rudd (Letters, 21 April) clearly has the gift of clairvoyance. She says that no liabilities would fall to the UK taxpayer or consumer should Hinkley Point C be cancelled. Who, pray, would foot the bill to complete the project should EDF withdraw after a few years of construction when cost and time overruns became apparent, as they have with other projects in France and Finland? And assuming the plant ever began generating its costly electricity, who would be responsible for the waste management costs, the size of which can only be estimated since the location, depth, technical details about cladding, inventory, or even if there will ever be a repository, remain stubbornly vague and could yet result in indefinite storage on site? Spent nuclear fuel from Hinkley C or Sizewell C would be on their respective sites for an estimated 160 years. Who will take title to hundreds of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel if, as is likely, within that time period, EDF disappears? As usual, the public purse would be required to bail out a private venture. Rudd’s claim of “no liabilities” is as irresponsible as a short-term response to legitimate concerns as government’s energy policy will prove to be in the long term. Better to cancel Hinkley, Sizewell and all the other nuclear plans now while some semblance of energy policy credibility remains, than to see it unravel in the most embarrassing way over the coming decades, leaving communities like ours to carry the can for government obsession with a nuclear fix. Pete Wilkinson Chairperson, Together Against Sizewell C • Amber Rudd’s claim that “new nuclear is the only proven low-carbon technology that can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining” is misleading. She and her advisers will know that woody biomass also provides secure, low-carbon electricity generation. It is currently being used with her government’s financial support as a clean alternative to coal at Drax power station in Yorkshire, the largest electricity production plant in the UK. Real Ventures has planning consents to build two biomass plants, each with 50 megawatts of dependable electricity output, providing “switch it on and leave it on” baseload power – unlike wind and solar technologies, which depend, on and so provide, intermittent sources of energy. Our port-located projects at Immingham and Hull will be combined heat and power (CHP) plants, also offering low-cost heat to local industrial customers on Humberside, including glasshouse vegetable growers. All we now need to start building them is some government financial support, already enjoyed by other renewable power projects such as offshore wind, solar and at Drax. Ray Tucker CEO, Real Ventures • Amanda Rudd implies that nuclear is needed to cover base-load generation because of the intermittency factor in wind and solar generation. She should speak with her German colleagues who are satisfied that they will meet their target of becoming independent of all fossil fuels by 2050, covering base-load with bio-digestion. This source of both gas and electricity – provided it is located close to a ready source of either waste vegetable matter of animal waste – is a win-win, as it puts to beneficial use what would otherwise release methane into the atmosphere and provides farmers with nutrient-rich irrigation ponds. Bio-digestion generation has a further advantage in that its output can be moderated to reflect demand at no cost, whereas nuclear is totally inflexible in this regard. The Finnish nuclear power station, on the same design as that planned for Hinkley Point, had, according to the Financial Times in December 2014, descended into farce, the construction of unit three being expected to open nine years late and several billions of euros over budget. The one in France is six years late and costs have more than trebled. That we should be asking the Chinese to build Hinkley Point is beyond terrifying given their blatant disregard for human life and safety. Kate Macintosh Winchester • Amber Rudd misleadingly implies that “continuous power” (ie not able to increase or decrease to fit demand) is advantageous. Moreover, the adjective she should have used for nuclear power is “constant”, which at large gigawatt source capacity presents a considerable challenge for transmission and for grid operators to balance against load. However, if “continuous” or “immediate” power is needed, there are many options from renewables. Biomass is stored energy that can be used for electricity, heat and fuels continuously or when needed, eg by immediate combustion, as biogas, as landfill gas, via pyrolysis, via fermentation and as oils and esters. Hydro power may be both continuous and rapidly adjusted. Variable generation from wind, sunshine and tides integrates over distance and time to be, in effect over the UK, continuous, but not constant. Constancy and controlled variation are provided by storage, eg pumped hydro, pumped tidal reservoir, batteries (of which there are many options), and, in effect, by demand-side load switching. Rudd goes on to praise nuclear power for aiming to supply electricity to 6m homes from a single power station. Such centralisation of multi-gigawatt capacity is not a sensible strategy because of the widespread disruption caused by unexpected generation and transmission outages, and by closures needed for refuelling. Nor sensible if we are concerned about terrorist disruption. The sensible alternative is a distributed generation system which integrates and controls power. Renewables fit a strategy for robust distributed power using a network (a grid) of connections, in a similar robust manner to the internet. Modern communications and control allow such a strategy, especially when blended with methods of using electricity efficiently. Dr John Twidell (Co-author of university textbook Renewable Energy Resources), Horninghold, Leicestershire • It is astonishing to read that Amber Rudd believes that nuclear is the only source of day-round power. King Canute, some years ago, knew of the inevitability of the tide. He used it to demonstrate the ignorance of his ministers.

Lord Powell of Bayswater, who was at Thatcher’s side during her most epic confrontations with Brussels during the 1980s, said the Eurosceptic former prime minister would always have preferred to battle the EU from within, whatever the scale of her frustrations, rather than opening the door to exit. “Of course she got fed up with it, but I don’t believe that as prime minister she would ever have campaigned to take Britain out of Europe or had a referendum to allow that to happen,” he said. “She wanted to change Europe and she set out to change it with great vigour, but I don’t believe she would have chosen this way and she would have avoided getting trapped by the referendum promise. “She never had any truck with referendums and frequently spoke out against them.” Powell, who sits as a crossbencher of the House of Lords, was speaking as Theresa May headed to the G20 summit in China to spell out to world leaders her vision of a post-Brexit UK that will be open for trade talks with non-EU countries. Powell added that he was “pole-axed” by the vote to leave on 23 June, which he regarded as a huge backwards step. Referring to David Cameron’s decision to hold a referendum, he said: “It was a terrible misjudgment and miscalculation. I would have preferred us to stay in and continue to work for change in Europe, which was beginning to happen at a faster pace.” His comments will anger anti-EU Tories who campaigned for Brexit, and who portray themselves as having completed the work of their political heroine. They claim she set the UK on the road to Brexit with her 1988 Bruges speech in which she warned of the dangers of ever closer EU integration. The Bruges speech – which Powell helped to write – deepened a rift with cabinet colleagues and helped to widen policy splits that eventually led to her fall from power. But Powell has said it was never intended to suggest she wanted the UK to leave the EU. May, who will hold bilateral meetings on Sunday with US president Barack Obama and Russian president Vladimir Putin at the G20 meeting in Hangzhou, will stress that Britain is “open for business” with countries across the globe. On Monday she will meet with Chinese president Xi Jinping, which threatens to be overshadowed by tensions over her decision to delay the go-ahead for the Hinkley Point nuclear power project in Somerset. In an interview recorded before leaving for China, May told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that despite recent good economic figures she would not “pretend that it’s all going to be plain sailing” and that “we must be prepared for the fact that there may be some difficult times ahead”. May also uses the interview to rule out a general election before 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2015/aug/07/shining-a-light-on-britains-nuclear-state","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-07T10:58:32Z","webTitle":"Shining a light on Britain’s nuclear state","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/aug/07/shining-a-light-on-britains-nuclear-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2015/aug/07/shining-a-light-on-britains-nuclear-state","fields":{"headline":"Shining a light on Britain’s nuclear state","bodyText":"Two momentous issues facing David Cameron’s government concern nuclear infrastructure. The new secretary of state for energy, Amber Rudd, recently confirmed her enthusiasm for what is arguably the most expensive infrastructure project in British history: the Hinkley Point C power station. At the same time, a decision is pressing on a similarly eye-watering commitment to renew Britain’s nuclear deterrent. Ostensibly distinct, both of these issues are intensely controversial, extremely expensive, agonisingly protracted, and often accompanied by vicious political rhetoric. Yet commentators rarely ask how these decisions might be connected. Could such links help to explain the strength of the UK’s nuclear lobby? Britain remains one of only a handful of countries committed to a “nuclear renaissance”, with senior government figures asserting the manifest falsehood that there is “no alternative” to nuclear power. Meanwhile, support for renewables and energy efficiency has been cut. It seems that Whitehall is in denial about the widely acknowledged performance trends of nuclear power and renewables. The reality is that renewables manifestly outperform nuclear power as low carbon energy sources. Successive UK and international studies show they are already more competitive than nuclear. And renewables costs continue to fall. Yet after more than half a century of development (and far greater levels of cumulative public support), nuclear costs keep rising. The performance gap just keeps on growing. Nor is there any good excuse for ignoring such overblown nuclear promises. Problems of reactor safety, nuclear waste and weapons proliferation remain unsolved. Nuclear security risks are uniquely grave. With finance in question and technical difficulties mounting, the deteriorating prospects of the Hinkley project are the latest episode in a familiar pattern. So why is the UK so persistent in pursuing new nuclear power? If the nuclear lobby is driving this, why have other countries with stronger nuclear industries nonetheless developed far more sceptical positions? In the case of Germany, this has meant the country with the world’s most successful nuclear industry and a less attractive renewable resource than the UK, nonetheless undertaking a wholesale shift from one to the other. One striking factor is an apparently strong correlation between those countries most eager to construct new nuclear with those expressing a desire to maintain nuclear weapons. But care is needed before jumping to conclusions. Historically, links between enthusiasms for nuclear power and nuclear weapons are well-explored. Almost all the attention here has focused on possibilities for diverting nuclear weapons materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium. These connections were crucial in early nuclear developments, and remain so in contemporary proliferation threats. But it is highly doubtful they explain the UK situation. An elaborate global nuclear safeguards regime introduces formidable barriers. And the UK has since the end of the Cold War maintained enormous gluts of key weapons materials. There are other more neglected questions. What if the links are less to do with the weapons themselves and more to do with wider technological systems required to run the associated nuclear submarines? It is, after all, these amazing feats of engineering whose range, capacities and undetectability aspire to make nuclear deterrence credible. As emphasised in debates during the general election, this infrastructure relies on very particular kinds of design expertise, engineering skills, supply chains and regulatory capabilities. Are there worries that loss of national civilian nuclear capacities will erode the capabilities required to make the UK’s nuclear deterrent credible? By analogy with other countries, is there something akin to a UK ‘deep state’ fearful of losing the cherished elite identity on the world stage conferred by nuclear deterrence? After all, a distinctive British “warfare state” has been shown by the historian David Edgerton to exercise strong influence on national technology strategies. The obscure provisions of the US/UK memorandum of understanding concerning transfer of nuclear submarine technology make it hard to answer these questions. But it seems the UK is committed to maintaining its own independent nuclear submarine supply chain – precluding the kind of foreign dependency (on France, China and others) now pervading the civilian nuclear industry. This might help to explain the resounding official silence on this matter. The separation between civilian and military nuclear activities is one of the most sacrosanct principles in global politics. It forms one of the most imminent threats of war. And – like other nations – the UK is bound by numerous treaty commitments which are foundational to the international order. So, it would be naïve to expect too much candour. Yet there may be other clues. Looking back to the New Labour era, one may lie in the remarkable flurry of activity that immediately followed a rare and brief loss of control, in which the 2003 energy white paper firmly concluded nuclear power was “unattractive” – instead backing renewables and energy efficiency. This exercise was driven by an unusual and temporary innovation in UK policymaking, in which the newly-formed Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit broke with normal practice, by recruiting external experts on independently-evaluated merit. When this allowed an independent look at nuclear power within government, the ‘deep state’ evidently developed a rare breach. What followed was one of the most spectacular U-turns in recent British politics. After only three years, a cursory further energy review was completed in 2006. Despite unchanged conditions and no new arguments, this reinstated a strongly pro-nuclear policy. Although the 2006 paper was itself overturned by judicial review on the grounds of being too superficial, the Blair government retorted that any further appraisal “won’t affect the policy at all”. Since then, UK nuclear commitments have once again dug in deep. But no government – including the present one – has ever properly explained why. What has not been examined until now is the intense policy commotion behind the scenes during this same period on the arcane topic of submarines. By 2004, the well-funded Keep Our Future Afloat Campaign (KOFAC) was underway. Run by a consortium of nuclear industry, trade union and nuclear-dependent local authorities, this was among the country’s most effective lobby groups. Aiming to maintain a UK nuclear submarine industry, KOFAC’s activities were not confined to the military sector. It also engaged enthusiastically in energy policy consultations, highlighting the importance of a shared skills pool for the military and civilian nuclear sectors. Evidently commissioned following the off-piste 2003 nuclear white paper, a report was produced for the ministry of defence in 2005 by RAND Europe. This detailed the risks posed to UK nuclear submarine capabilities, and the deterrent more broadly, by a depleted workforce and skills base. Aided by KOFAC, the RAND study triggered a series of related documents from MoD and other security institutions. Defence select committee inquiries were undertaken and a new white paper was produced, reaffirming the commitment to a submarine-based nuclear deterrent. At the same time, anxious parliamentary briefings appeared, new research programmes were initiated – and regulatory agencies joined the clamour on the civilian side to “keep the nuclear option open”. Joining these efforts, submarine producer BAE Systems set up a key suppliers group to improve co-ordination among nuclear contractors. This culminated in 2009, with the government launching the Nuclear Skills Institute whose remit again quietly spans the linkages between crucial skills across civilian and defence sectors. So the links between UK civilian nuclear power and military interests in nuclear submarines run deep. What is remarkable is the complete lack of discussion these provoke in the media, public policy documents, or wider critical debate. Yet the stakes are very high. Does the commitment to a submarine based nuclear deterrent help to explain the intensity of high-level UK support for costly, risky and slow nuclear power, rather than cheaper, quicker and cleaner renewable technologies? If so, the conclusions are not self-evident. For some supporters of a nuclear deterrent, the additional burdens of nuclear power may seem entirely reasonable. But the almost total silence on these connections raises crucial implications for democracy. Imminent decisions that the government must take over nuclear power and the nuclear deterrent are hugely significant. There is a responsibility on all involved to be open and accountable. Otherwise, it will not just be electricity consumers and taxpayers that pay the price, but British democracy itself.

In a study published on Tuesday in the Scientific Reports journal, a team that included experts from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre in Japan said the new techniques showed a “substantial growing magma reserve” inside Sakurajima, located just off the coast of Kagoshima city, in south-west Japan. The team said the magma buildup could trigger a repeat of the volcano’s deadly eruption of 1914, which killed 58 people and caused widespread flooding in Kagoshima, home to more than 600,000 people. Dr James Hickey, the lead author of the study, said the team had found a new way to map the natural “plumbing system” inside volcanoes that could improve authorities’ ability to predict eruptions and issue earlier evacuation guidance. “What we have discovered is not just how the magma flows into the reservoir, but just how great the reservoir is becoming,” Hickey said. “We believe that this new approach could help to improve eruption forecasting and hazard assessment at volcanoes not just in this area, but worldwide. “We know that being forewarned means we are forearmed and providing essential information for local authorities can potentially help save lives if an eruption was imminent.” Sakurajima is about 30 miles from two nuclear reactors that were restarted last year, as Japan resumed its nuclear power programme after the March 2011 Fukushima meltdown. In 2013 the 1,117-metre-high Sakurajima – a popular tourist attraction – spewed ash as far as Kagoshima and sent rocks flying into populated areas, causing damage but no major injuries. Dramatic footage taken in the early evening in February last year showed the volcano erupting in a fiery blast before sending lava flows down its slope. It last erupted in July, sending ash 5,000 metres into the sky. There are scores of active volcanoes in Japan, which sits on the Pacific “ring of fire” where a large proportion of the world’s quakes and eruptions are recorded. Mount Fuji, Japan’s most famous volcano – and its highest peak – is active but has not erupted since 1707. In September 2014, a major eruption on Mount Ontake in central Japan killed 57 people. The British and Japanese research team focused their study on Aira caldera – a vast, submerged crater that stores magma and feeds it into nearby Sakurajima, causing almost daily eruptions. They found that the caldera – a cauldron-like volcanic depression – was supplying Sakurajima with about 14m cubic metres of magma every year, enough to fill Wembley stadium in London three and a half times over. The magma is entering the volcano at a faster rate than it can be released through small, frequent eruptions, leading the researchers to conclude that a much bigger eruption is possible within the next three decades. “The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5 km cubed in volume – a massive event,” Hickey said. “From our data we think it would take around 130 years for the volcano to store the same amount of magma for another eruption of a similar size – meaning we are around 25 years away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/dec/06/eus-chief-divorce-negotiator-michel-barnier-to-make-first-brexit-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-06T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"EU's chief divorce negotiator to make first Brexit statement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/06/eus-chief-divorce-negotiator-michel-barnier-to-make-first-brexit-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/dec/06/eus-chief-divorce-negotiator-michel-barnier-to-make-first-brexit-statement","fields":{"headline":"EU's chief divorce negotiator to make first Brexit statement","bodyText":"Michel Barnier is to make his first detailed public statement on Brexit since taking up the role of the EU’s chief divorce negotiator, as a senior EU source confirmed that the bill for leaving the bloc was expected to total €55bn-€60bn (£46bn-£51bn). Barnier, a former French foreign minister, has made almost no public comment since taking up his post on 1 October. Instead he has been in listening mode, touring the EU’s national capitals to sound out opinions on Brexit. So far, he has visited 18 of the EU’s 27 remaining member states, a grand tour that has taken him from the granite splendour of the Irish taoiseach’s office in Dublin to the palm-tree fringed government buildings in Nicosia. Barnier has pointedly refused to start talks with the British government, although David Davis was permitted a half-hour “courtesy coffee” when the Brexit secretary made a cloak-and-dagger trip to Brussels last month. Although he has pronounced on none of the big questions, he has chosen to tweet a few dry jokes at the UK’s expense, including a picture of himself standing outside the Museum of Broken Relationships in Zagreb. Last month, an aide to the Frenchman tweeted a picture of Barnier and the deputy negotiator Sabine Weyand enjoying a glass of prosecco between meetings in Rome. Days earlier, Boris Johnson was ridiculed for telling the Italian economics minister that Italy would want to grant the UK access to the single market to avoid seeing British imports of prosecco dry up. On Tuesday, the Frenchman is likely to repeat the EU’s mantra of “no negotiations without notification” at his first official press conference, billed as a chance to give an overview of his Brexit work. Barnier’s officials have drawn up a Brexit bill totalling £46bn-£51bn, a source has told the Guardian, confirming earlier reports. The bill would cover the UK’s share of EU staff pensions, unpaid bills on infrastructure projects, and the cost of decommissioning nuclear power plants. But the number varies considerably depending on assumptions about what the UK is liable for. The commission’s number-crunchers are also examining different Brexit scenarios to gauge the potential economic hit for the UK and the EU27. EU negotiators have been stressing for weeks they are ready to begin Brexit negotiations “tomorrow” and are waiting for Theresa May to launch article 50 by her promised deadline of the end of March. This will start the clock ticking on two years of negotiations, but the time for substantive talks could be far shorter. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s pointman, has said actual Brexit talks could be squeezed into 14 or 15 months, once the EU process is taken into account, with the crunch coming in late 2018. Barnier told experts from the EU’s other 27 member states last week that he wanted to avoid a soft transition deal that would see Britain staying in the club on easy terms for an indefinite period. He also listed the main points that article 50 should cover: borders, settling Britain’s Brexit bill, and the status of EU citizens. European politicians are insisting that the questions of Britain’s trading and foreign policy status with the EU will need to be resolved separately. As well as Croatia and Italy, Barnier’s grand tour has taken him to the EU’s powerhouses, Germany and France. In December, he will tick off Finland, Spain, Hungary and the Czech Republic, in a mission that echoes the sweeping round of visits by David Cameron begun 18 months ago, as the then prime minister tried to shore up support for his EU reform plans. Barnier’s only direct foray into the talks was a tweet to quash speculation that he would insist on running the Brexit negotiations in French. Tuesday’s press conference will be conducted in French and English, a commission spokesperson said. Although Barnier will be one of the most prominent faces of the Brexit divorce, he will not be running the show. The commission will lead the technical work on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, who will define Barnier’s negotiating mandate. EU leaders will convene for a special summit to agree their red lines four to six weeks after May presses the article 50 button. The Brexit deal will also have to be approved by the European parliament’s Verhofstadt and 750 other MEPs, including those from the UK. MEPs have been the strongest voices arguing for the UK to have completed its exit before European parliament elections in mid-2019. But talks on the UK’s future economic and trading status with the EU remain uncertain. Seeing the heated, sometimes confused debate in London, many EU diplomats and politicians are convinced that the British government does not yet know what relationship it wants with the EU. “I am not sure the UK will be ready at the time of notification to give a view on the kind of status it wants,” said one senior diplomat. Another view is that the government is still in election mode and has made little advance on Brexit since the summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-27T20:17:39Z","webTitle":"Josh Frydenberg: Australia's use of coal is falling 'and that is not a bad thing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2016/jul/28/josh-frydenberg-australias-use-of-coal-is-falling-and-that-is-not-a-bad-thing","fields":{"headline":"Josh Frydenberg: Australia's use of coal is falling 'and that is not a bad thing'","bodyText":"Australia’s new environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, says coal will be a declining part of Australia’s energy mix because of inexorable market forces – but he insists the Coalition’s much criticised Direct Action policy is up to the mark, and will allow Australia to meet its international emissions reduction targets. Frydenberg told Guardian Australia he accepts the science of climate change and his goal in the new portfolio is “to achieve affordable, reliable, and accessible energy supply as we transition to a lower emissions future” – including optimising new technologies and renewable energy sources, with gas as a significant back-up. Frydenberg in his previous portfolio of resources was a strong advocate for the coal industry – a fact which triggered concerns from environmentalists when he was transferred to the new combined portfolio of energy and the environment by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in his recent ministerial reshuffle. Asked whether transitioning successfully to a lower emissions future would inevitably mean less reliance on coal-generated power, Frydenberg said: “I accept that a transition is occurring away from coal and that is not a bad thing.” “Coal-generated power is still a part of our energy mix, with today about 60%, but that has come down from 70% a decade ago,” he said. “It’s coming down, and the market is bringing on this change. “Eight out of 12 of Australia’s most emissions-intensive power stations have closed in the last five years. So it’s occurring.” But while acknowledging that shift, Frydenberg moved to play down expectations that a scheduled review of the Direct Action policy in 2017 would yield any substantial overhaul. Many experts argue the Coalition’s climate policy is expensive and not up to the task of delivering Australia’s Paris commitments. Frydenberg rebuffed those criticisms, and minimised the review as a “sit-rep” (situation report) rather than a substantial process that would yield any significant policy change. He said the policy as it stood was “very successful”. Asked whether there was any need to strengthen the baselines to force emissions reductions sufficient to meet the Paris targets, Frydenberg said: “The baselines are what they are. We are confident that we will meet our Paris commitments.” Many analysts believe the Direct Action scheme could be converted into a baseline and credit scheme, but that would reopen the Coalition’s fierce internal debate about carbon pricing that saw Malcolm Turnbull lose the opposition leadership to Tony Abbott. Conservatives have been facing off in a series of proxy battles with the prime minister since the Coalition was returned to government with a wafer-thin majority. Frydenberg effectively closed the door on a significant overhaul of Direct Action post-review. “Our settings, our policy settings are established, and I’m confident we’ll meet our 2030 targets.” Asked why then continue with the scheduled review of the policy in 2017 if there was no prospect of adjustments, the minister said: “The review is simply a sit-rep. We believe the ERF is working to get the lowest cost abatement that will meet our 2030 targets.” He also ruled any changes to the existing renewable energy target, which is legislated out to 2020. “We’ve now got the architecture in place, the ERF, the RET, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the programs we have funded under Arena. That’s what I’m rolling out. The 2020 RET figure is set in stone. That’s very important because it invites stability in investment in the sector,” Frydenberg said. He said his first priority in the portfolio was an upcoming meeting of state and territory energy ministers on 19 August, which would consider developments in the national electricity market, specifically “how to ensure we get a greater integration of renewables into the electricity market, and a greater focus on new technologies.” Frydenberg noted that all the states had different renewable energy targets and they were at different points of diversification in their respective energy mixes. Tasmania, for example, has more than 90% renewables. South Australia is around 41%, Victoria is around 12% and New South Wales about 8% – and then there’s the federal RET. “The question is how do I integrate the state and the federal policies,” Frydenberg said. Power outages in South Australia in 2015 were blamed on that state’s high proportion of wind energy by some conservative commentators, but Frydenberg said there were several factors involved in the blackouts, only one of which was the intermittency of wind . While minimising some of the negative commentary, Frydenberg said gas remained fundamentally important as a source of back-up power to ensure a stable transition to low-carbon sources. “The lessons going forward are we need diversity of supply,” he said. “What I’m trying to say to people is it’s a transition and my job … no matter what I say I won’t please Bob Brown – but what I can do is help ensure a stable transition to a low emissions future and that’s why you need the gas. At the same time we’ve got to better integrate the new technologies into the system.” He also noted the costs of renewable energy had come down markedly in recent years, which was a significant factor in a successful move away from carbon-intensive power sources. “My department tells me in the last seven years the cost of wind has come down 50% and the cost of solar PVs have come down 80%.” “I’m told by the CSIRO the cost of battery storage will come down 60% over the next 10 years. We are going to see big changes in domestic markets, and the intermittency of renewables is better handled with new technologies that will allow us to store renewable energy.” Frydenberg dismissed a question about whether the government might need more than market forces to trigger a rationalisation of coal-fired power – perhaps a structured plan to phase out coal. “I think the market is driving these changes. You’ve got the RET, you’ve also got a changing face of the domestic economy.” Asked about the future of the Adani mine in Queensland which was approved by his predecessor Greg Hunt, the minister said it was up to the company about whether to proceed with the development, but he said the Commonwealth would invest no money in the project. He also welcomed moves in South Australia to reopen an “informed” debate about the nuclear fuel cycle, but he said Australia would never move down the path of activating nuclear power unless there was bipartisan support. “We are not opening up nuclear power as an issue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/aug/18/an-expanded-nuclear-industry-in-south-australia-makes-no-economic-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-17T22:00:17Z","webTitle":"An expanded nuclear industry in South Australia makes no economic sense | Richard Denniss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/an-expanded-nuclear-industry-in-south-australia-makes-no-economic-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/an-expanded-nuclear-industry-in-south-australia-makes-no-economic-sense","fields":{"headline":"An expanded nuclear industry in South Australia makes no economic sense","bodyText":"The South Australian government is conducting a royal commission into expanding the nuclear industry in the state. If the pro-nuclear positions taken by the majority of the commission’s advisory committee are anything to go by, this would mean two things: expensive nuclear power, and expensive nuclear waste. The economic case for nuclear power is already shaky. Respected financial advisory firm Lazard recently gave their assessment of the unsubsidised cost of energy. They found that existing renewable and gas technologies are already cheaper than nuclear power. And while renewables are getting cheaper, new nuclear builds are getting more expensive. Flagship projects in the US and Europe are suffering from chronic cost overruns, while the UK’s Hinkley Point C project is in doubt, despite the UK government signing a 35-year deal to buy electricity at nearly twice the current market rate. Some, like Senator Sean Edwards, hope that other countries will pay Australia to take their waste. They then hope to build so-called “fourth generation” reactors which can burn other countries’ waste as fuel. In effect, Senator Edwards thinks we could get fuel for less than nothing. Fourth generation reactors look great on paper, but on paper is the only place you will see them. Despite industry hopes of greater safety and the ability to reduce waste to more manageable levels, none have been built. Should Australia be the first? For one of those lucky countries without high level nuclear waste, this seems like an extraordinary step to make. We would give ourselves a waste problem in the hope that we, unlike everyone else, could solve it – like a person who takes up smoking just to prove they can quit. While fourth generation reactors, if they work, could take existing stockpiles requiring 10,000 years of safe storage, and reduce it to waste requiring only 500 years, this does not eliminate the problem. A solution would still need to be found that lasted 500 years. Unlike existing nuclear nations, Australia would not be reducing an existing problem. We would be creating a new one. Can we safely secure waste for centuries? Unfortunately international experience suggests not. Multiple facilities designed to last thousands of years have already failed in mere decades. How certain are we that we can do it better than, for example, Germany and the US? The spruikers of the idea that the brightest future for South Australia is a nuclear waste dump have suggested it will provide “free electricity”. Like all magic pudding solutions to complicated problems, the idea simply doesn’t stack up. After 50 years of nuclear power there is no shortage of nuclear waste in the world. Countries with that waste currently spend a lot of money storing it and the magic pudding merchants argue that South Australia could get rich from it. But let’s think this through. If nuclear waste is actually a “resource” then why would the countries that have piles of the stuff pay us to take it away? If fourth generation reactors are really so cheap and easy to build then why don’t the people with established nuclear industries and “waste resources” build one themselves? And if South Australia could succeed from scratch where experienced hands have failed then why wouldn’t the countries with all of the waste build one after South Australia spent a fortune finding out how it is done? Surely even Senator Edwards can understand that if fourth generation reactors could be built then the obvious place to build them would be right next to existing waste stockpiles. Exporting nuclear waste from most counties is illegal, as well as extremely dangerous and expensive. The cost of renewable energy is falling as fast today as the cost of mobile phone fell a decade ago. As demand for renewables increases so too does the rate of innovation. But just as the world is reaching a tipping point in which the costs of renewables with storage is lower than the cost of coal some techno-optimists have managed to convince South Australians to instead bet on nuclear technology even as the rest of the world is walking away from its risk and cost. No one set out to cause climate change. But 100 years ago no one could have imagined that we would build enough coal fired power stations to heat the globe. Giving the fossil fuel industry free “waste disposal” services was the same as giving them a big subsidy. It wasn’t deliberate but it was a mistake. Today the South Australian government is seriously considering jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. While people a century ago didn’t know about the risks of polluting the atmosphere when burning coal, policy makers today know exactly the risks of storing nuclear waste. The idea that the South Australian taxpayer should underwrite the cost of a nuclear waste dump, underwrite the cost of a nuclear power station, and then provide both with “free” insurance is as bizarre as it is expensive. Unlike building coal fired power stations in the past, it would be a deliberate mistake.

The electricity company, which is also a major player in the UK energy market, is attempting to buy staff out of a deal, dating back to 1946, that allows some 30,000 executives and managers to work 32 hours a week or around 196 days a year. The move comes as health chiefs consider a controversial plan to reform the maximum 35-hour working week, one of the pillars of French socialism, in the country’s hospitals. The proposal has brought thousands of medical workers on to the streets and follows an intervention last August by the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, who said companies should be given more flexibility over working time. The EDF talks follow a report by the state auditors, the Cour des Comptes, which declared that salaries at EDF had risen rapidly, above inflation and market rates, with little relation to actual performance, and there was an “accumulation of advantages” including low-cost electricity and cheap loans. EDF first mooted changing what the official auditors described as a “very generous” and “badly controlled” system enjoyed by more than 40% of its staff five years ago, but gave up on reforms after vehement union opposition. Under current rules, as well as their 27 days paid holiday, staff can enjoy an extra 27-31 days of extra time off, known as “recuperation days” (RTT) and generous bonuses. EDF staff also pay around 16 times less than ordinary customers for their electricity at a cost of €381m to the company in 2010. “The advantage is without limit no matter what electric equipment the employee has (including heated swimming pools, for example),” reads the report. In 2011, when EDF tried to revise the cheap electricity tariff, unchanged since 1951, staff went on strike and the company backed down. Other benefits described as “exorbitant for the public purse” included free shares in the company, extra pay depending on the number of children, bonuses for marriages and births, subsidised house and financial assistance with school and university fees for children up to the age of 27 years. The Cour des Comptes found that “despite the crisis” salaries at EDF had increased more rapidly between 2005 and 2011 than in the rest of the economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/feb/03/clean-coal-power-plants-matt-canavan-hints-at-government-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-03T02:12:46Z","webTitle":"'Clean' coal power plants: Matt Canavan hints at government subsidy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/03/clean-coal-power-plants-matt-canavan-hints-at-government-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/feb/03/clean-coal-power-plants-matt-canavan-hints-at-government-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"'Clean' coal power plants: Matt Canavan hints at government subsidy","bodyText":"Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, has flagged subsidising a “clean” coal baseload power plant from the government’s $5bn northern Australia infrastructure fund, and says the government has already heard from an interested party. Canavan on Friday suggested a potential investor in a new power station was eyeing off development in the Galilee Basin, the planned site of the Adani coal mine – and he said cheap power had been the key to opening up the Bowen basin in Queensland in the 1960s. He dismissed the energy industry’s views that coal was a legacy technology with little or no prospect of commercial viability, and accused companies, including AGL and Energy Australia, of trying to lock out competition. “With all respect to those very eminent companies, we wouldn’t take advice from Coles and Woolworths on whether we should allow Costco to come into the Australian market,” Canavan told the ABC. “I’m not surprised that existing generators don’t want another large-scale baseload power station to come into the market, particularly in an area like north Queensland where they are making good money selling electricity now at very high prices. “Good luck to them. What I’m about is the national interest.” Government sources have told Guardian Australia that Canavan is a driving force internally behind Malcolm Turnbull’s pivot this week to “clean” coal, which the prime minister executed during a scene-setting speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday. The prime minister lamented the fact that $590m had been spent on clean-coal trials and demonstration, and yet Australia lacked an efficient, low-emissions, coal-fired power plant with carbon capture and storage. “Who has a bigger interest than us? We are the biggest [coal] exporter. And yet we don’t have one power station that meets those requirements,” Turnbull said on Wednesday. He said it was time to develop a technology-neutral approach to the energy market and “strip the ideology out of this debate”. This was followed by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, saying it would be “morally prudent” for Australia to build new coal fired power plants, potentially with taxpayer support. Several ministers have signalled over the course of the week that such projects could be funded by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The Coalition has opened the new political year determined to position itself as the party of low power prices, and the party of energy security, to make a partisan point about Labor’s commitment to ambitious renewable energy targets in Canberra and the states. Consumers are concerned about rising power prices, and the energy issue is a red hot one in the heavily contested state of South Australia. The Nationals, like Canavan, are also feeling the heat in the regions from the One Nation insurgency. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, tweeted after Turnbull’s address this week that it was good to see the government “come around to One Nation’s position”. But despite the renewed political positioning, the evidence cuts across the government’s arguments that “clean” coal plants will produce cheaper energy, as well as provide secure baseload power. The evidence says such plants are very expensive to build, and have long construction lead times. Industry estimates put the power costs from ultra super critical coal plants at between $80 and $100/MWh – which is no cheaper than power from renewable technologies – and the price of renewables has dropped significantly in recent years, and is trending down. Canavan told the ABC on Friday that refineries in Townsville and a smelter in Gladstone were struggling under high power prices. He said there was no baseload power station north of Rockhampton, and industrial consumers in north Queensland were paying twice the price for power compared with businesses in southern Queensland “because of the cost of transporting the electricity to the north”. Canavan, who is also the minister for northern development, said there was “no reason why we shouldn’t have a very vibrant metals manufacturing industry with good high-paying jobs for people”. “We’ve got the minerals. We’ve got the cheap coal. The clean coal technologies are proven. We should be smart enough to do it like other countries are,” he said. Queensland’s energy minister, Mark Bailey, rejected Canavan’s analysis, and argued north Queensland was “benefitting from a boom over the next year and a half as a raft of new clean energy power stations are built and come on line at Kidston, Lakeland, Clare, Collinsville and Mount Emerald.” He said the $380m Mount Emerald wind farm would generate enough output to power a city the size of Mackay. “There’s also FRV’s 100MW Clare Solar Farm near Ayr, MSF Sugar’s 24MW bagasse generation plant at its Tableland Mill, Genex’s Kidston 50 MW Solar Project and pumped hydro for baseload plus Edify’s 58 MW Whitsunday Solar Project - to name only a few,” Bailey said. “North Queensland currently has two large-scale hydro facilities – Kareeya and Barron Gorge – which together provide over 150 MW of renewable energy capacity. A third major hydro facility is proposed for North Queensland through the Kidston Project, which could deliver 250 MW of pumped-storage hydro-electric power to the region.” During his interview on the ABC, it was pointed out to Canavan that climate scientists believed there should be a moratorium on coal to ensure that Australia and the rest of the world met the emissions reductions targets agreed at the Paris climate conference. In response, Canavan drew a comparison to Japan, saying it had a similar Paris target to Australia and was investing in “clean” coal in order to meet its target. “They are meeting their Paris targets by investing in these technologies and there’s no reason why we couldn’t do the same,” he said. He did not point out that Japan was investing in super critical coal because it took the decision after the Fukushima disaster to phase out nuclear power. The Australian Financial Review reported on Friday that Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, told a forum in Brisbane on Thursday evening that comparisons with Japan were not valid because Australia was in a different situation. “Japan is in a different situation because they are taking nuclear out of the mix. They are in a situation where they are facing demand growth,” Finkel is reported to have said. “If you have demand growth, that needs to be filled and Japan are doing what really India and China are doing. They are investing in ultra super-critical coal. Australia is not seeing demand growth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-live-updates-who-global-recession-fears-update-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-05T00:30:02Z","webTitle":"Italian educational institutions close as Covid-19 deaths pass 100 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-live-updates-who-global-recession-fears-update-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-live-updates-who-global-recession-fears-update-latest-news","fields":{"headline":"Italian educational institutions close as Covid-19 deaths pass 100 – as it happened","bodyText":"The markets bounce is continuing in Tokyo where the Nikkei is up 1.1% on Thursday morning. That’s not quite the bounce that we saw on Wall Street where the Dow surged 4.53%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.22% and the Nasdaq rose 3.85%. But it will give investorts some cheer. That’s it for the day on this blog but you can follow what happens with the virus story and the markets with a new blog that my colleague Helen Sullivan has just launched to take us through the next 24 hours or so. You can read that here: Still with the airline industry and Reuters reports that Donald Trump met executives from some of America’s leading airlines to discuss the coronavirus outbreak. The airline bosses told the president they have stepped up procedures to keep planes “clean and disinfected” amid concerns about the the spread of the virus. Executives from Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue, among others, attended the meeting at the White House with Trump, vice president Mike Pence and other officials. Trump said airlines would be affected by the fall in international travel related to the virus. “It’s affecting the airline business, as it would. And a lot of people are staying in our country and they’re shopping and using our hotels in this country, so from that standpoint I think probably there’s a positive impact, but there’s also an impact on overseas travel which will be fairly substantial,” Trump said. The airline executives said the industry was taking measures to intensify aircraft sanitation. “We’ve stepped up our efforts to make sure the airplanes are clean and disinfected,” said Southwest Airlines boss Gary Kelly. The struggling airline Flybe is set to collapse within hours, according to the Press Association. We reported earlier that the regional carrier, which narrowly avoided going bust in January, was on the brink of bankruptcy again thanks to a drop in demand caused by the coronavirus. But an airline source has told PA that it is expected to enter administration overnight after talks on Wednesday failed to secure a rescue package. Here’s our story from transport correspondent Gwyn Topham: Here’s a summary of the most recent developments: It was confirmed that two more people had died in the USA, bringing the total there to 11. They included the first person from outside Washington state to die, as well as another person within Washington. There was further deaths and cases in other nations across the world. Local authorities in Iraq said two people had died. In Stockholm, officials said 16 new cases had been identified, taking the Swedish total to 52 and Algerian authorities said 16 members of the same family had now tested positive. Other nations, including Slovenia and Hungary, identified their first cases. Sporting events in Italy are to be held behind closed doors for a month, the local government ordered. The events will include England’s Six Nations match against Italy and a host of Serie A games. All events inside the “red zone” are cancelled altogether. Two recent patients at Kings College hospital, in south London, tested positive. The hospital was not allowing visitors on to the wards where the patients were being treated, the Guardian understands. A British woman was among two more confirmed cases in Senegal, local authorities said. The nation’s health ministry identified her as a 33-year-old from London who arrived in Senegal on 24 February. A family of four in Ireland tested positive, bringing the number of confirmed cases on the island to nine. They included six cases in the Republic of Ireland and three in Northern Ireland. You can read a summary of the day’s earlier news here. A tourist in Darwin in Australia’s Northern Territory has tested positive for coronavirus. It is the first confirmed case in the territory, which contains hundreds of remote communities. The 52-year-old man carrying the virus is in isolation in Royal Darwin Hospital. The man recently arrived in Darwin from Sydney and has had limited contact with the local community, NT Health said in a statement. The department was undertaking contact tracing and would reach out to those who may have been in contact with the man, the statement said. Stock markets have continued to rally at the opening of Thursday’s trrading session in Asia Pacific. The Australian benchmark ASX200 index is up almost 2% this morning after losing more than 10% from its all-time highs in the past 10 days. All sectors were up but tech shares led the way with a rise of 3%. and follows a strong shjowing on Wall Street in Wednesday’s session. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney said a number of factors were behind the big lift and that it was not just theresult of the US Fed’s rate cut on Tuesday. A Congressional spending package, the rise of Joe Biden and stronger than forecast data lifted US optimism and sent stocks soaring. Major share indices leapt 4% overnight. Bonds sold off, gold prices eased and industrial commodities lifted. The US dollar rose against the yen and euro, but commodity currencies lifted further. Asia Pacific futures markets indicate the optimism will flow into today’s trading. Saudi Arabia has identified a new case, its health ministry has announced in a statement published by the state news agency. The kingdom said the person in question was travelling with another already known to have been infected and that both had come from Iran via Bahrain; a fact the second person had not initially disclosed. The ministry confirmed the new case is quarantined in hospital and that everyone who interacted with him has been tested, though no results have yet been obtained. Kings College hospital has confirmed that two recent patients have tested positive. A spokesman for the south London hospital has said: The trust has had two recent patients who have tested positive for Covid-19. We have strict protocols in place to manage the control of infection and to reduce the possibility of cross-infection, and this includes restricting access for staff and visitors to the ward. Public Health England experts are carrying out contact tracing and will be in touch with individuals who may have been exposed to the virus to provide them with advice. For anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus, call 111 or visit here as the first port of call. The two patients at Kings College hospital are among the 87 already confirmed cases in the UK – not additional to them. A generally available coronavirus vaccine is unlikely to be available within the next 12 months, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser has said. Discussing the timeframe and feasibility of making such available to everyone in the country on this evening’s edition of ITV’s Peston programme, Sir Patrick Vallance says: I think a vaccine that can be used generally, we’d be very lucky to get one within a year ... Clearly, what you’d tend to do with a vaccine if you’ve got an effective vaccine – and there’s a whole question about how much of it you can manufacture and how much you can make available – but what you tend to do is protect the most vulnerable first and then grow it as you need to. And the same principle’s taken with influenza vaccination. Asked if he feels it’s time to move from the containment phase to the delay phase on managing the spread, Vallance says: This is clearly a global thing, it’s not unique to the UK and, therefore, part of this is when the World Health Organisation decides that it moved from contain to delay because that should ideally be a global response. Failing that, we’re keeping an eye on when we think we do reach that stage and we’ll make that decision, ideally with other countries as well. As we reported earlier, Vallance is due to advise UK government minsters on their response on Thursday. Peston is due to air at 10.45pm GMT and is broadcast live on Twitter shortly beforehand. The US House of Representatives has approved an $8.3bn (£7.3bn) funding bill to combat the spread of coronavirus, sending the emergency legislation to the Senate. The measure, which passed by 415 votes to two, funds a series of US government-sponsored initiatives, including expanded testing for the virus that has infected at least 129 people in the nation. The Senate is expected to take up the bill quickly and send it to the US president, Donald Trump, to be signed into law this week. Iraq has seen its second coronavirus death, the country’s health ministry has said in a statement published by the state news agency. It added that the patient lived in Baghdad and suffered from other chronic conditions. Slovenia has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, the local health ministry says. The patient travelled to the country from Morocco, through neighbouring Italy, and is now in a Ljubljana hospital, the Slovenian national news agency STA reported. So far, Slovenia has performed 352 coronavirus tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), which is chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, is due to meet on Thursday. The group provides scientific and technical recommendations to government, though Whitehall sources have stressed to the Press Association that the decision on whether or not to change from the contain to the delay phase in dealing with coronavirus would rest with ministers. A family of four in the Republic of Ireland has tested positive for coronavirus, raising the number of confirmed cases in the country to six and the number on the island of Ireland to nine. The two males and two females, who live in the west of Ireland, were all “associated” with recent travel to northern Italy, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has announced. Two cases were confirmed in Northern Ireland earlier on Wednesday, raising the number of confirmed cases there to three. Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer with Ireland’s department of health, said there was still no evidence of widespread or sustained community transmission in the country, as seen elsewhere in the EU. While we now have six confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland, we continue our containment efforts, central to which is that the public know what to do in the event they have symptoms. Paul Reid, the head of its Health Service Executive, said it was still in a containment phase but planning for all eventualities. From what we are learning however as we see how the virus spreads in countries across Europe and in the UK we are facing a potentially unprecedented situation in this country and across all of our health services. A worker at Google’s European headquarters in Dublin who had flu-like symptoms tested negative for coronavirus, prompting the tech giant to tell staff they can safely return to the office after two days of working from home. Senegalese authorities have reported two new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to four since the first case was confirmed there on Monday, Reuters reports. The nation’s health ministry have identified one of the patients as a 33-year-old British woman from London who arrived in Senegal on 24 February. The ministry said the other is the 68-year-old wife of the 80-year-old Frenchman from a Paris suburb whose case was confirmed on Wednesday. The couple arrived in Senegal on 29 February. Both new patients are in stable condition at a hospital in Dakar and the two earlier patients’ conditions are “evolving favourably”, it said. Senegal is the only sub-Saharan African country besides Nigeria to have confirmed cases of the virus. Experts say it is not yet clear why sub-Saharan African countries have registered so few cases of the virus, which could challenge fragile health systems on the continent. All professional football matches and other big sporting events are to be held behind closed doors until 3 April due to the outbreak, the Italian sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora has said. The behind-closed-doors order does not apply to fixtures within the “red zone”, which are suspended.* On Tuesday, the Juventus and Milan’s Italian Cup semi-final second leg match was postponed. The match was meant to be held on Wednesday night and would have followed the 1-1 first-leg draw in Milan’s San Siro. Authorities have also announced the postponement of the other semi-final second leg between Napoli and Inter Milan. The upcoming derby d’Italia, the name given to a match contested by Inter and Juve, is set to be played on Sunday or Monday. In the regions worst hit by the emergency, such as Lombardy, theatres and cinemas will also remain closed. *We originally reported such fixtures would go ahead behind closed doors. This post has been amended to reflect that they will not. Washington state, the hardest-hit in the union thus far, has confirmed the death of another person, taking the toll there from nine to 10, while the first death outside that state has also been announced. According to Reuters, the local health agency in Placer County, in California, has said a resident has died. That is alongside those in the greater Seattle area, which has also seen 12 new cases; taking the total there to 39, the local department of health has said. This is now backed up by a report in the Gazzetta di Parma newspaper. It says a draft order will go even further and decree that all sporting events in the “red zone” will be cancelled altogether, while those outside it will be played behind closed doors. It appears all sporting events in Italy will become behind-closed-doors fixtures for 30 days, until 3 April. Besides numerous rounds of domestic professional football fixtures, that would also cover the Italy v England Six Nations match a week on Saturday (14 March), though this has not yet been confirmed. The number of cases in Algeria has increased by nine to 17, the country’s health ministry has said. They include 16 from the same family in the Blida province, about 30km south of the capital Algiers, as well as an Italian man. Sixteen new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Stockholm, according to local authorities, taking the total number of cases in Sweden to 52. Region Stockholm said: Sixteen additional patients were found infected with Covid-19 ... The infected patients are being cared for in isolation to reduce the risk of further transmission. The causes of four of the 31 confirmed cases in the Stockholm region remain under investigation, as – unlike the rest of the cases – no clear link to infection abroad or contact with people who had been infected abroad was found, the authority said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has confirmed the nation’s first two cases, saying each involves an Iranian student. Writing on his Facebook page, he said: We have the first infected individual, or rather two right away, whom we had to hospitalise. They have no symptoms yet but the fact of the infection has been confirmed. Iran has been one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus outside China. According to Reuters, the students had travelled home for the Iranian new year, and one of them reported for a health check once back in Hungary to make sure he was not infected, Janos Szlavik, the head of the national institute for infectious diseases, said. Szlavik declined to say which school the students attend. The wife of one of the students and the girlfriend of the other were isolated, he said, adding that Hungary was assessing their movements before the diagnosis and any risk of further contagion. Iraq has announced its first coronavirus death. The country’s health ministry said the person died in the capital, Baghdad, according to the Reuters news agency. France now has 285 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the head of the public health service, Jérôme Salomon, has said, which is an increase of 73 compared to a day earlier. During a press briefing, he added that the death toll was still at four people and that 15 were in intensive care. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, have discussed the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, Downing Street said. A spokeswoman said: They discussed the coronavirus epidemic and the prime minister updated the president on the UK’s four-strand approach to contain the virus, delay its spread, research its origins and cure and mitigate the impact should the virus become more widespread. The two leaders agreed to work together on an international response to combat the spread of coronavirus. The people who have tested positive in Northern Ireland did not travel through the Republic, the latter’s chief medical officer believes. Two new cases have been confirmed north of the border, bringing the total there to three and the number in the UK to 87. Perhaps more pertinently, it brings the number on the island to five. Speaking at a press briefing in Dublin, Tony Holohan said: The contact tracing process has only begun. We have not been alerted to any cross-border aspect in terms of that contact tracing. It is still quite early in the contact tracing process so it is still possible, but there are no indications as of yet. He added that there was no reason to cancel the St Patrick’s Day parade due to take place in the Irish capital. As things stand and on the basis of our assessment, we see no implications for the St Patrick’s Day parade. • The Italian government has ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March as it grapples to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus that has claimed 107 lives, an increase of 28 in 24 hours. “We are focussed on taking all measures for direct containment or delaying the spread of the virus,” the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said during a press conference on Wednesday. “The health system risks going into overload, and we will have a problem with intensive care if an exponential crisis continues.” • The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has jumped by more than 60% to 87 cases, in the biggest daily increase recorded to date. They include three who contracted the disease without travelling abroad, confirming fears that community transmission is already occurring in the UK and that attempts to contain the virus have at least partly failed. • The coronavirus outbreak has led India to restrict the export of dozens of drugs including paracetamol and various antibiotics, leading to fears of a global shortage of essential medicines. On Tuesday, concerns over supply chain shortages led the Indian government to place limits on the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines and vitamins made from them. • Fears of a coronavirus-driven global economic slowdown have mounted after stock markets gave a lukewarm reaction to the emergency cut in US interest rates and new data showed that China and Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill in February. As the World Health Organization warned that panic buying and market manipulation was “rapidly depleting” supplies of protective equipment, world leaders and central banks continued their scramble to cushion the economic impact of the outbreak. • Schools and universities are being closed and concerts, conferences and sporting events cancelled around the globe. Cancelled events have included the London Book Fair, while MGM Universal has announced the postponement of the release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die. The organisers of Britain’s Cheltenham Festival expect the number of people attending the showcase horse racing event to be down this year because of concerns over the coronavirus. A record-breaking 266,000 people attended the four-day event in Gloucestershire last year but the Jockey Club, which runs the event, said ticket sales were slowing. The festival is bringing in a raft of measures to try to keep racegoers healthy including increasing the number of toilets and hand-washing stations. But any significant reduction in crowds would be a huge blow to Cheltenham and surrounding areas, which rely on the festival for a multi-million pound boost each year. Ian Renton, regional director for the Jockey Club, said the festival, which is due to begin on Tuesday, had taken part in numerous discussions over the past week with both the government and the racing industry. He said: “We’re pleased to hear the messages the government has put out suggesting there will be no immediate change to business as usual. “On that basis we’re proceeding and looking forward to a great festival and are taking steps to make sure we have got systems in place to make sure hygiene is at its maximum.” The festival is setting up additional toilets and hand-washing facilities and extra staff will operate in all toilet areas to ensure that soap and drying facilities are constantly available. The release of the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, will be postponed until November 2020, MGM Universal have announced. Schools and universities in Italy will close from Thursday until 15 March, Italian authorities have announced. The number of confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for coronavirus in Italy has risen to 107 from 79, Italian authorities have said. The number of confirmed cases in Italy is more than 3,000. As we reported earlier, Italy’s government is set to close cinemas and theatres and ban public events across the whole country to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, according to a draft decree drawn up on Wednesday. The decree, seen by Reuters, orders “the suspension of events of any nature... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.” The Italian education minister, Lucia Azzolina, has said that the decision to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March - reported by the Italian news agency Ansa and several local outlets - has not yet been taken but will be decided “in the next few hours”. Health authorities and the energy company EDF are attempting to trace people who may have been in contact with a worker based in south-west England who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning to China. The 35-year-old Chinese national, who has been based in Somerset, left the UK after concluding a placement with the energy firm. He developed symptoms of Covid-19 two days later and was confirmed to have the virus on 1 March. Public Health England said: “Authorities in China report that the person did not have symptoms while in the UK, so the risk to other people in the UK is considered to be very low.” It is understood that the man had been in the UK for a number of months before returning to China. Information posted online by Chinese authorities said the man flew with Cathay Pacific from London to Hong Kong on 27 February. He then took a ferry to China, at which time his temperature was normal, and then travelled in a taxi to his home in Futian district. The man developed symptoms on 29 February and was taken to hospital, then placed in isolation. He tested positive for Covid-19 at 12.40am on 1 March, Chinese authorities said. A cross-party group of MPs has asked the British government to adopt a “flexible approach” to social security rules to ensure people on welfare benefits or low incomes are not penalised if they self-isolate in line with official coronavirus guidance and are unable to work or look for jobs. The House of Commons Work and Pensions select committee said no one following public health advice should face an “invidious choice” between financial hardship and putting themselves and others at risk. In a letter to the work and pensions secretary, Therese Coffey, the committee chair, Stephen Timms, wrote: “I hope you will agree that the exceptional circumstances of this outbreak necessitate a flexible response from the DWP. To contain the spread of the virus, it is vital that those required to self-isolate are not deterred from doing so due to the threat of sanctions or loss of income.” People who claim unemployment benefit or low-paid workers who claim in-work benefits through universal credit are required to meet stringent requirements to access welfare payments, known as claimant commitments. These include attending regular job centre meetings and providing proof they have been searching for jobs or seeking better-paid work. Claimants who are deemed to have failed to meet those requirements can be subject to financial penalties including the suspension of welfare payments for between four weeks and six months. Although the DWP says sanctions are applied as a last resort - and that claimants will not be penalised if they contact officials to explain why they cannot meet their claimant commitment - there is lots of evidence that the much-criticised sanctions have been applied capriciously or for trivial reasons, leaving claimants penniless and reliant on food banks. In England, three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Trafford, Manchester, and in Oldham, Greater Manchester. Trafford Council website said the three in its area were people who had travelled to northern Italy. Two further positive cases of the coronavirus have been detected in Northern Ireland, including one adult who recently travelled from northern Italy. The other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who has subsequently tested positive, health officials at the Northern Ireland Executive told the Press Association. The results are being sent to England for verification. As schools, universities and events are closed, cancelled and postponed around Europe, the Guardian’s John Henley has written this wrap. It includes: France A total of 257 confirmed cases and four deaths. Thirteen regions affected. Four main clusters so far: Oise in northern France (64 cases), Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan in Brittany (12 cases); the fourth relates to a group of tourists who took part in an organised visit to Egypt (11 cases), while five members of the same family caught the virus after attending an evangelical church service at Mulhouse in eastern France. Italy By far the worst European outbreak: 2,502 confirmed cases so far and 79 deaths. The virus has spread to all but one of Italy’s 20 regions, with the majority of cases (1520) in Lombardy, followed by Emilia-Romagna (420) and Veneto (307). Most Italian regions have under 50 confirmed cases. Two groups of Italian tourists were under quarantine in India today, with 16 testing positive for the coronavirus, prompting authorities to tighten controls. Health minister Harsh Vardhan said that passengers on all international flights would now be screened, the AFP news agency reported. Visitors from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan - except diplomats and officials from international bodies - were already barred, on Tuesday, along with those from China last month. Vardhan said a husband and wife in the first Italian group - who arrived last month and number around 20 - fell ill while visiting the western state of Rajasthan, a popular tourist destination. The remainder were moved to a quarantine centre in New Delhi, where 14 members plus their Indian driver were confirmed as being infected. This seems to be emerging a bit of a trend. Footage has appeared showing Iranian health workers dancing and singing in an effort to keep morale up as the country faces the worst coronavirus outbreak outside China. This was the scene in China meanwhile... The World Health Organization (WHO) has been running a live question and answer session online. The latest figures in the UK – where the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has jumped to 85 – do not suggest the country is past the stage where the containment approach is no longer valuable, according to a senior microbiology expert. Prof Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, was speaking after authorities said the number of coronavirus cases in the UK had jumped by 60% to 85, the biggest daily increase recorded to date. He said: “Today’s increase in numbers represents a three times greater increase in new cases per day than we’ve seen in the last few days. However, most are associated with known cases or have history of foreign travel. “Three of the cases appear to have no such contacts – this is further evidence that the infection is spreading in the community. “However, the latest case numbers do not suggest we are past the stage where the containment approach is no longer valuable. Even though the increase looks dramatic, it should not alter our strategy at the moment.” While Britain’s Department of Health has said it will no longer tweet details of the locations of new coronavirus cases, some local authorities are doing so on what appears to be an ad hoc basis. Two new cases are in Lancashire and Newcastle upon Tyne respectively. In both areas, details were provided in the form of video messages from health officials. Update: Derbyshire county council says two further cases were confirmed in its area, bringing the county total to three. Twitter has said it will stop any attempt by advertisers to use the coronavirus outbreak to send inappropriate advertisements to its users. Government entities seeking to spread public health information will be allowed to promote epidemic-related ads, the company said in a blog post. It added that Twitter’s “global trust &amp; safety team” was “continuing its zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to abuse our service at this critical juncture”. It added: “At present, we’re not seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues. “However, we will remain vigilant and have invested substantially in our proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviours.” Russia has been targeted from abroad by foes spreading fake news about the coronavirus to sow panic, according to President Vladimir Putin. His remarks came as Russia’s communications regulator said it had shut down access to some social media posts containing falsehoods about the outbreak. “The federal security service reports that they [the fakes] are mainly being organised from abroad. But unfortunately this always happens to us,” Putin said on Wednesday, in televised remarks at a government meeting. “The purpose of such fakes is clear: to sow panic among the population.” Reuters reports that a Russian cybersecurity company, Group-IB, on Monday identified what it said were thousands of fake news posts on messaging services and social networks such as Russia’s VK alleging that thousands of Muscovites had caught the virus. Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round “umrah” pilgrimage amid fears of the new coronavirus spreading to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, according to the country’s interior ministry. The state had decided “to suspend umrah temporarily for citizens and residents in the kingdom”, the ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi press agency. China’s ambassador to Ireland has urged Irish authorities to make a speedy decision on mass gatherings, the Irish Times reports. While declining to say whether events such as St Patrick’s Day parades should be cancelled, He Xiangdong said: “The authorities here in Ireland need to take the very smart and quick and cautious, while at the same time reasonable decision in terms of that [mass gatherings]. “Our own experience is that [at] the early stage we needed to make some hard decisions in terms of if the mass gatherings needed to be held or not.” The comments of the ambassador, speaking at a reception in Cork, come after the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said his government would not be advising the cancellation of St Patrick’s Day parades at this stage. Prof John Oxford, a virologist from Queen Mary, University of London, has said it would not be the end of the world if the event, which draws hundreds of thousands of domestic and overseas visitors to Dublin, was cancelled or at the very least postponed. “If I were in their shoes I would say ‘we must postpone it’, it’s not the end of the world for one year,” he told RTE Radio 1. “After all the Chinese postponed the Chinese new year, which is immense.” Global business travel – and airline profits – are in deep trouble from coronavirus if the evidence offered at London City airport on a weekday morning is indicative of the sector’s travails. On Wednesday, the business travel-dominated airport in the shadow of Canary Wharf had as many check-in staff as there were passengers, with customers reporting a decline in demand from European hubs such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge spoke to travellers at London City and has filed this report. A man travelling through Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport has been put in quarantine in a portable room on a fire department parking lot after testing positive for the new coronavirus. The municipality of Haarlemmermeer, where Schiphol is located just outside the Dutch capital, set up six of the rooms last week as the virus began to spread across Europe. “It’s a sort of portable container-like room with a door, window, toilet and shower,” said a spokeswoman for Haarlemmermeer, Petra Faber. A Northern Ireland hospital is planning to send Covid-19 patients to England for treatment. Antrim Area hospital is ready for drive-through testing for the virus and expects patients will receive results within four hours. Dr Seamus O’Reilly, medical director for the Northern health and social care trust, said: “If the test comes back positive there is a very well-rehearsed process that we do in conjunction with our colleagues in England.” Italian football authorities look set to order Serie A to play matches behind closed doors as the country struggles to control the coronavirus outbreak. Following a series of postponements, including this week’s Coppa Italia semi-finals, Italian football is facing a backlog of fixtures as the virus spreads. This has prompted the head of the Italian FA to suggest playing matches without crowds is an increasing likelihood. “We are heading towards that decision,” Vincenzo Spadafora told reporters when asked if the government was thinking of barring fans. “We will continue all activities, and so will the league, but we will respect public health.” The quarantined dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong could be the first case of human-to-animal transmission, animal health experts in Hong Kong have said, although they cautioned that the matter remained under investigation. The agriculture, fisheries and conservation department (AFCD) said a pet dog had repeatedly tested weak positive for the virus, which indicates a low level of infection. The AFCD added in a statement that it first collected samples from the dog for tests on 26 February and detected low levels of Covid-19 virus from its nasal and oral cavity samples on 27 February. Tests were repeated on 28 February and 2 March. There are now six confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York state, including four new cases today, according to the state’s governor Andrew Cuomo. The wife, son, daughter and neighbour of a coronavirus patient in Westchester have tested positive. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York State, is giving a press conference. Follow live here: Italy’s government is set to close cinemas and theatres and ban public events across the whole country to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, according to a draft decree drawn up on Wednesday. The decree, seen by Reuters, orders “the suspension of events of any nature... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.” It also tells Italians to avoid hugging and shaking hands to prevent as much as possible a further spread of the potentially deadly illness which has been mainly concentrated in the country’s northern regions. There was some confusion earlier when the Italian news agency Ansa said schools and universities were to close in Italy until mid-March as the country battles to control the coronavirus. Italian education minister Lucia Azzolina said that the decision had not yet been taken but would be decided “in the next few hours”. Global calls are mounting for restrictions to prevent the panic-buying of protective health equipment amid concern over shortages, as the World Health Organization called on governments and industry to increase production by 40% to help counter the spread of the coronavirus. As France issued a decree to requisition masks for key health workers and those suffering from the disease, other countries warned that stocks of masks and other equipment were running low in some of the worst-affected locations, with suppliers unable to meet demand. French health officials say around 8,300 masks and 1,200 bottles of sanitising health gel have been stolen from Paris hospitals. Another 2,000 surgery masks have disappeared from a hospital in Marseille. The French government said it would take legal measures to rein in the soaring price being demanded for bottles of hand gel. Exacerbating the problem around the world is the fact that China, which has been worst-affected by the coronavirus, is the world’s biggest supplier of protective masks for medical use, producing half of the masks used around the globe. India’s top pharmaceuticals export group has said that an Indian government curb on some drug exports as the coronavirus outbreak spreads has caused panic in Europe and will “severely impact” businesses in the sector. The world’s main supplier of generic drugs has restricted the export of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and the medicines made from them, in a move seen as aimed at tackling possible domestic shortages of medicine during the outbreak. Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil), told Reuters that some of the restricted APIs and medicines were widely exported to Europe and the United States. “I am getting a huge number of calls from Europe because it is very sizeably dependent on Indian formulations and we control almost 26% of the European formulations in the generic space. So they are panicking,” Dua said. Israel’s chief rabbi has advised Jews to forego the traditional touching of the “mezuzah”, a decorative case containing a small holy scroll that is attached to many doorposts in the country. In an advisory published on Wednesday, the rabbi, David Lau, said there was no religious obligation to carry out the practice, and it was enough for Jews to reflect on the scroll’s message when entering or leaving a home. The handwritten parchment contains the Biblical “Shema” prayer verse that declares: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is One.” “During these days, when we are witness to the spread of a serious disease, there is no doubt that one should not kiss the mezuzah or touch it at all,” Lau wrote. Slowing growth will hit poorest countries hardest, the World Bank president, David Malpass, has said, as the institution announced it was making $12bn available to provide immediate support to low-income countries dealing with the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus. Malpass added that the money would go to helping developing nations strengthen their health systems, which are fighting an epidemic that has already spread to more than 60 countries. “The point is to move fast,” Malpass told reporters. “Speed is needed to save lives.” EU officials in Brussels have been alerted to a second possible case of coronavirus infection within the bloc’s institutions. Staff in the EU council have been advised that an unnamed colleague has fallen ill and “appropriate cleaning” was being undertaken in the relevant offices in Brussels. Earlier in the day, the European Defence Agency confirmed that a member of staff had been diagnosed with the virus. It appears that the virus has caused the the first cancellations by a major sport in the United States. The Chicago State University men’s basketball team will not travel for two regularly scheduled Western Athletic Conference games this week, and its women’s team will not host two games. The school said in a statement it was making the move with the “health and wellbeing of the campus community in mind”. The university said the men’s team would not travel to Seattle University or Utah Valley University for Western Athletic Conference games on Thursday and Saturday. The school also said the women’s team would not host Seattle or Utah Valley at the campus’ Jones Convocation Center on the same days It looks like the (already troubled) British airline FlyBe risks becoming one of the first airlines to succumb to the turbulence being thrown up by the new coronavirus. Sky News and ITV have both been reporting that it is warning that it is running out of funds. Britain’s Department of Health added that it would no longer be tweeting information on the location of each new case from today, due to the number of new cases. “Instead, this information will be released centrally in a consolidated format online, once a week. We are working on this now and plan to share on Friday.” The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has jumped by 34 in a day, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 85. The Department for Health said the figures included 32 new patients in England. The department added in a statement: “Twenty-nine patients were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. “Three additional patients contracted the virus in the UK and it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an individual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. “The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 80. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases is 85.” Health officials in France say around 8,300 masks and 1,200 bottles of sanitising health gel have been stolen from Paris hospitals. Another 2,000 surgery masks have disappeared from a hospital in Marseilles. The French government says it will take legal measures to rein in the soaring prices being demanded for bottles of hand gel. Anyone wanting to buy masks from a pharmacy will have to get a medical prescription. The German airline Lufthansa has grounded 150 aircraft due to the coronavirus (as first reported by Reuters). A spokeswoman told the Guardian that 125 of the grounded planes were continental and 25 were intercontinental. Lufthansa has 752 aircraft according to its website so this amounts to approximately a fifth of its fleet. Earlier, Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged to look into reports that airlines were flying half empty planes around the world just to retain lucrative slots under international allocation rules after a drop in demand for air travel. The Italian education minister, Lucia Azzolina, has said that the decision to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March - reported by the Italian news agency Ansa and several local outlets - has not yet been taken but will be decided “in the next few hours”. A 95-year-old woman who died in a Sydney hospital on Tuesday night has been confirmed to have had coronavirus, the second death from Covid-19 in Australia, according to Nine News Melbourne. Another person has tested positive for the coronavirus in England. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said a person who was admitted to Wythenshawe hospital had tested positive for the coronavirus. He said: The hospital remains open and we would ask that people keep their appointments and attend unless they are unwell. Please note the risk from the virus for the majority of people is low. The trust has strict protocols in place to manage the control of infection and to reduce the possibility of cross-infection. Public Health England (PHE) experts were carrying out contact tracing and would be in touch with anyone who may have been exposed to the virus, the spokesman said. The total number of known cases in the UK now stands at 54. It was 51 at the end of Tuesday (48 in England and one each in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) but two new cases were announced in Scotland earlier today. The daily update on total infections in the UK is expected at 2pm. The Italian government had already shut schools and universities in the worst-affected regions in northern Italy some 10 days ago and quarantined towns at the centre of the outbreak. However, it has struggled to contain the virus, with more than 2,500 people infected. All schools and universities are to close in Italy until mid-March as the country battles to control the coronavirus. The Italian news agency ANSA says the decision was taken at a meeting by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, with his cabinet. There have been 79 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, the third highest after China and Iran. Update: Italian Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said that the decision has not yet been taken but would be decided “in the next few hours”. Saudi Arabia has temporarily suspended Umrah pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina for Saudi citizens and the kingdom’s other residents due to coronavirus concerns, the state news agency SPA said today. The kingdom had already closed its two holiest sites to foreign travellers. Britain’s prime minister has pledged to look into reports that airlines are flying half empty planes around the world simply to secure lucrative slots under international allocation rules after a drop in demand for air travel. Boris Johnson said he was unaware of it when a backbench Conservative MP, Paul Maynard, asked him if he knew that airlines were flying the planes due to “perverse incentives” for them not to lose the slots. “Will he seek a derogation for the UK from these international rules, if only for the sake of the environment?” asked Maynard during questions in parliament. Johnson replied: “I will look at it. It certainly seems crazy that planes should be flying simply to retain the slots to which they are entitled and we will see what we can do.” Bill and Melinda Gates have paid for 15,000 medicinal molecules to be shipped to a leading laboratory in Belgium to be tested as a potential cure for the coronavirus. The therapeutic samples, all active ingredients in current antiviral treatments, will be screened at high speed for their inhibiting effect on particles developed from a swab from the first Belgian patient to be diagnosed. The molecules, from the Scripps research institute in California, will be shipped to the Rega Institute for Medical Research, in Leuven, 20 miles (32km) east of Brussels. The Scripps institute has an extensive collection of the active ingredients of existing or in-development drugs. With Covid-19 now spanning at least 79 countries, with more than 3,100 deaths, the Guardian has produced these maps on how the virus is spreading Brighton College, an independent day and boarding school in south-east England, is one of many schools borrowing from Hong Kong and Japan and preparing to switch to virtual learning for its pupils in the event of school closures, which it plans to trial next week. Richard Cairns, Brighton College’s headmaster, has written to parents at the Sussex school: Clearly, the prospect of any school closure is a matter of great concern for those approaching public examinations and for all of our pupils whose education would be disrupted. As a consequence, we have for some time been exploring the use of online teaching and learning platforms for such an eventuality, drawing on the experience of schools in Hong Kong and Japan where schools have been closed for some time. We are now confident that we have an appropriate and impressive educational platform that will enable us to offer a meaningful programme of lessons, marking and feedback. In consequence, I have decided that all the schools of Brighton College will have a training day on Friday 13 March. There is no case of the coronavirus at Brighton College nor among anyone associated with it. There is some confusion in Thailand over what quarantine measures are being introduced for people travelling from countries hit by the coronavirus. On Tuesday, the country’s public health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, posted an order on his official Facebook page stating that people arriving from Germany, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, France, Singapore, Italy and Iran would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. But hours later the post disappeared, and the minister’s Facebook page appeared to have been deactivated. A ministry spokesperson said that a correction was being made and that an updated announcement would appear soon. This is yet to materialise. This isn’t Anutin’s first comms slip-up. Last month, he caused controversy by stating that foreigners who refused to wear face masks should be kicked out of the country – a comment that contradicted health advice given elsewhere, and which many speculated was unhelpful given the country’s tourism crisis. Thailand’s ministry of public health has since stated that it is only necessary to wear a mask if you are a healthcare worker or if you are sick. Sony has sent staff at European offices, including London, home for the rest of the week. No cases have been detected but the move has been taken as a precaution. The Scottish government has now released more information about the two further patients in Scotland have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases across the country to three. One patient is resident in the Grampian area, the second patient is resident in the Ayrshire area. One patient has recently travelled to northern Italy and the other has had contact with a known positive case – but the Scottish government added that this contact was not with the first positive case confirmed in Scotland, a Tayside resident. Both patients are “currently clinically well and are receiving appropriate clinical care”. There have been a total of 914 negative test results in Scotland since the start of the outbreak. All 1,150 students at a high school in Israel, plus the members of an elementary school class in a different school, have been instructed by the government’s health ministry to self-quarantine at home. The instructions come after a teenager and a 5th-grade teacher were diagnosed with the coronavirus, the Times of Israel reports. Football fans who sat in a particular area at a Tel Aviv match last week have also been told to go into isolation. Plans are being brought forward to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the very first day someone is sick instead of four days, Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has told MPs. “I think that is the right thing. Nobody should be penalised for doing the right thing,” he told parliament, in answer to a question about people who are self-isolating at home. Johnson was described by Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, as “our part-time prime minister” after criticism that it had taken some time for Johnson to emerge before appearing to launch the government’s action plan on the virus. The Labour leader said a decade of austerity under the Conservative government had put the UK in a difficult position to cope with the outbreak. Boris Johnson said people who self-isolate are “helping to protect all of us by slowing the spread of the virus” in announcing sick pay changes as part of emergency coronavirus legislation. “If they stay at home and if we ask people to self-isolate, they may lose out financially,” he told the House ofCommons. “So, I can today announce that the Health Secretary will bring forward, as part of our emergency coronavirus legislation, measures to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the very first day you are sick instead of four days under the current rules, and I think that’s the right way forward.” The quarantining of cities and towns would be supported by 74% of people in the UK, according to a global poll by Ipsos Mori. The survey asked if respondents would support preventing anyone from entering or leaving if there has been a large number of coronavirus cases there. Of the countries included in the survey, Vietnam was most likely to agree (91%) while only three in five of those in Italy agree. There has been a drop in Britons’ perceptions of how well the government is responding to the virus in the run-up to the announcement on Tuesday of the British government’s action plan. When asked on 14-15 February, almost two-thirds of the UK public (63%) thought the government was doing a good job in containing the spread of the virus. One week later this has dropped, with only half (50%) feeling the same way. In comparison, seven in 10 (70%) believe national health organisations in the UK are doing a good job. The first case of the new virus in European Union offices in Brussels has been announced. It appears to have been in the European Defence Agency (EDA), according to this report. Euractive says a source told it that a senior EDA official who contracted the virus had returned from a trip to Italy last week. Afterwards, he had a meeting with around 30 officials from other EU institutions last week and started feeling sick on Saturday before testing positive for Covid-19. A member of the military staff of the European External Action Service (EEAS) who attended the meeting has started experiencing symptoms and is waiting for the outcome of the test, the source added. An EEAS source further said the other participants of the meeting have since held other meetings and/or travelled. Ireland has recorded a second case of coronavirus but plans to go ahead with St Patrick’s Day festivities. Health officials revealed the second case – a female in the east of the country who recently travelled from northern Italy – on Tuesday night. The infection is not related to the Dublin schoolboy who was diagnosed last weekend after he also visited northern Italy. The foreign affairs ministry updated its travel advice to warn against non-essential travel to the Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna regions. The chair of Ireland’s coronavirus advisory group, Cillian de Gascun, told RTE on Wednesday there was still no evidence of community transmission in Ireland. However, he said the situation was fluid and noted that two weeks ago Italy had only three cases and now had more than 2,000. The chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said the second infection was “not unexpected” and that Ireland remained in a containment phase. He said that “as things stand” the celebrations leading up to St Patrick’s Day on 17 March could go ahead. Meanwhile, Google asked most staff at its European headquarters in Dublin to work from home for a second day pending an update on an employee who on Monday showed flu-like symptoms. Public Health England has suggested it may recommend that people stop shaking hands “although we’re not there yet”. Its emeritus medical director, Prof Paul Cosford, said: We may get to a point where if we see more widespread infection we ask people to limit the social contact they have with each other. This could include limiting everyday interaction, although we’re not there yet. What’s most important at the moment is that people practise good hand and respiratory hygiene and wash their hands frequently and thoroughly. Our message is clear, simple handwashing with soap for 20 seconds is key to good hygiene and this will make a real difference in stopping this virus spread. On Monday, when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, extended her hand to her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, at a meeting on Monday, he refused her handshake and waved her away amid concerns about spread of Covid-19. Plans to increase the increase the availability of specialist equipment to provide oxygen in anticipation of more people suffering from breathing difficulties are being made by health authorities in the UK. There was confusion on Tuesday when the health minister, Matt Hancock, spoke about increasing the number of what he referred to as home ventilation kits, with doctors and medical professionals among those ridiculing or questioning what he meant. It has emerged that Hancock was referring to the NHS Home Oxygen Therapy service, which provides ventilators or oxygen concentrators to people requiring respiratory aid. Contingency planners are taking steps in anticipation of higher numbers of patients with breathing difficulties to increase the availability of the equipment so that doctors can have them as an option. It’s not clear how exactly the plan will work, or if the equipment will be prescribed to patients to take home. According to NHS guidance, a oxygen concentrator machine is suitable if someone would benefit from having oxygen for many hours a day, including while they are asleep. The machines, which are about 75cm (2.5ft) high and plug into electrical sockets, filter oxygen from the air in the room and delivers it through plastic tubes to a mask or nasal cannula. Long tubing can be fixed around the floor or skirting board of a house, with two points where they can be can plugged in to the oxygen supply. When the machine is installed, an engineer or nurse normally discusses the length of tubing needed. The NASUWT, one of the largest teaching unions in the UK, has written to the Department for Education in England and its counterparts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, urging them to extend their coronavirus advice to schools to address a surge in incidents of racism and xenophobia. The union says it has received increased reports of black and minority ethnic teachers and pupils being subjected to “racist name-calling and intimidation” connected to the Covid-19 outbreak. Chris Keates, the union’s acting general secretary, said:“The NASUWT is extremely concerned at the extent of increased incidences of abuse, prejudice, xenophobia and racism as a result of the coronavirus (Covid-19). “Misinformation and false reporting about the coronavirus, its causes and how it is spread have fuelled fear and panic and in some cases led to the ostracising of people of east Asian heritage and others perceived to be ‘foreign’ or an ‘immigrant’ within the UK. “Unfortunately, schools and colleges are not exempt from the associated xenophobic and racialised stereotyping of Chinese and other east Asian people. The NASUWT has received reports of increased covert and overt racial attacks perpetrated against some minority ethnic pupils and NASUWT members linked to coronavirus concerns. “The NASUWT is urging the Department for Education to communicate with schools and provide guidance and support for school leaders.” The total number of deaths from the new coronavirus in Iran has reached 92, the country’s healthy ministry is reporting. About 8% of the Iranian parliament’s MPs have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday, as the country announced plans to mobilise 300,000 soldiers and volunteers against the deadliest outbreak of the epidemic outside China. Two senior Iranian officials have already died from the virus and several more are infected. Semi-official news agencies on Tuesday reported that the head of the country’s emergency medical services, Pirhossein Kolivand, was now also ill. A hospital staff member in the north-west of England has been confirmed as a case of the new coronavirus.Although the patient is believed to have contracted the virus in Italy, the case is the latest example of a health worker succumbing to it. A spokesman for the North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust said: “The trust can confirm that a member of hospital staff has tested presumptive positive for Covid-19 following a trip to northern Italy. On returning from the trip, the member of staff sensibly self-isolated and did not come into work or have any contact with patients. “We can assure the public that the risk remains low. The trust is operating normally and there is no need to cancel any appointments.” On Monday, a clinician at Hertfordshire Mount Vernon Cancer Centre was initially confirmed positive for the virus but then tested negative. A family doctor in Brighton and a member of staff at Worthing hospital, West Sussex, were among the first coronavirus cases to be identified in Britain last month. There were concerns last week that a Surrey GP may also have been infected. The regional director for Public Health England said on Monday that none of the four patients in a cluster in the county were GPs or health workers. The Hannover Messe, a major industrial fair in Germany, has announced its postponement until July. A pharmaceutical company in Japan has said it is developing a drug for high-risk patients infected with the new coronavirus, joining several other drugmakers seeking to develop a treatment for an illness. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co said it was working on a plasma-derived therapy that had previously been shown to be effective in treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections, Reuters reports. Its research would require antibodies from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus infections or who have been vaccinated, once a vaccine has been developed. “By transferring the antibodies to a new patient, it may help that person’s immune system respond to the infection and increase their chance of recovery,” Takeda said in a statement. Coronavirus is likely to be spreading undetected in the UK already, with health officials on the brink of moving into the phase of “delaying” rather than trying to “contain” transmission, the chief medical officer has said. Chris Whitty, who is helping to lead the government’s response, said it was “likely, not definite, that we will move on to onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Whitty said the UK was almost in the second phase of the government’s strategy of trying to contain, delay, research and mitigate the virus. “When I was here previously, we were firmly in contain stage. Now I think we are on the borderline between containing and delaying. But many of the things you do to contain it also delay it.” Whitty gave his assessment as the government designated coronavirus a notifiable disease, which means some companies will be able to seek insurance compensation for coronavirus cancellations. The move brings England into line with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland, which have already added coronavirus to their lists of notifiable diseases. The London Book Fair, a huge event in the publishing industry and due to take place between 10-12 March, has been cancelled. Publishers and agents had been pulling out day by day but it’s still a major development in terms of the impact of the announcement. Here’s a tweet from the organisers. This is Ben Quinn picking up the live blog now. You can flag up any news tips by email at ben.quinn@theguardian.com or on twitter at @BenQuinn75 The European Central Bank said on Wednesday that it’s restricting all non-essential travel by members of its executive board and employees until 20 April as a precautionary measure amid the global coronavirus outbreak. The Associated Press reports the central bank for the 19-nation eurozone said visits to its Frankfurt headquarters and its public visitor centre are being suspended for the same period. It is postponing or cancelling conferences that were due to be held at the bank but says that news conferences after regular policy-setting meetings of its governing council are unaffected, and that the next one will go ahead on 12 March as planned. On Tuesday, the World Bank and the IMF announced they would be scrapping the spring meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington and replacing them with virtual meetings because of coronavirus outbreak Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and David Malpass, the president of the World Bank Group, said in a joint statement: Like everyone else around the world, we have been deeply concerned by the evolving situation of the coronavirus and the human tragedy surrounding it. Given growing health concerns related to the virus, the management of the IMF and World Bank Group and their executive boards have agreed to implement a joint plan to adapt the 2020 IMF-World Bank spring meetings to a virtual format. Our goal is to serve our membership effectively while ensuring the health and safety of spring meetings participants and staff. We remain fully committed to maintaining a productive dialogue with our stakeholders and will leverage our IT-related and virtual connection capabilities to the fullest to hold our essential policy consultations with the membership. We will also continue to share IMF and World Bank analyses. With this adapted format, we are confident that our member countries will be able to effectively engage on pressing global economic issues at these spring meetings. A couple of universities have decided to postpone their graduation ceremonies in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The University of Buckingham announced today it has postponed its graduation ceremonies due to fears of aiding the spread of the coronavirus. The event will be rescheduled for later in the year. Sir Anthony Seldon, the university’s vice-chancellor, said: We have made the difficult decision to postpone our graduation ceremonies due to the precautionary warnings from the government regarding the coronavirus (Covid-19). Any disappointment felt is entirely understandable but we truly believe this is the best decision for our students and their guests. Our hope is that by announcing this news as early as possible, those who need to invoke cancellation policies on travel or accommodation will still have time to do so. The University of London has decided to postpone the graduation ceremony for students on its distance and flexible learning programmes. The ceremony was scheduled to take place in London on 3 March at the Barbican Centre. Pro-vice-chancellor Chris Cobb said: We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the event due to the ongoing coronavirus issue. We truly regret the inconvenience caused but, after careful consideration, we felt it important to minimise the risk to our students and their guests. This event is different to many others due to the large numbers of attendees travelling from affected regions and the potential impact it may have on others attending and travelling back to regions which are currently unaffected. Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has said that two more cases of coronavirus were confirmed overnight, taking the number of patients diagnosed in the country to three. She refused to give further details of the new cases in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme. Freeman said evidence globally suggested that for the vast majority of those infected the symptoms would be “very mild”, but added that the advice was still to “self-isolate” in a bid to contain the virus. “People have a conscience about it where they don’t want to infect others so our expectation is that the overwhelming majority of people will follow that clinical advice and stay at home”. Freeman added that a power existed under the 2008 Public Health Scotland Act to apply for a court order “if someone has an infectious disease and will not follow clinical advice in order to make sure they are quarantined”. But she added: “That’s a very harsh power and we’re not at that point.” Asked about Scottish government figures suggesting a worst-case scenario of 160,000 being hospitalised, she said these numbers came from Chinese figures that were being refined and remodelled to fit the UK scenario, and said that not all of those people will require hospital treatment at the same time. Freeman said she was looking at capacity in the health service and aware of the need to create more headroom, in particular in areas such as where patients need high oxygen therapy. She said she would be meeting with local authorities later on Wednesday “to ensure that people who are clinically ready to leave hospital are doing so as quickly as possible”. The latest daily update from the World Health OrganiZation (WHO) states eight new countries – Andorra, Jordan, Latvia, Morocco, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Tunisia – reported cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The WHO is particularly concerned by the increase of coronavirus cases in the eastern Mediterranean region is of great concern and reiterated the need to enhance surveillance and response activities, and share critical information. Here are the latest numbers on Wednesday: Globally: 90,870 confirmed (1,922 new ) China: 80, 304 confirmed (130 new) and 2,946 deaths (31 new) Outside of China: 10,566 confirmed (1,792 new), 72 countries (eight new), and 166 deaths (38 new) WHO risk assessment: China: very high Regional level: very high Global level: very high The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Spain has risen to 167 after new cases were detected in Madrid (10 new cases) and Mallorca (two). Meanwhile, Spain has also confirmed its first coronavirus fatality: a 69-year-old man who died in the eastern region of Valencia on 13 February. He is reported to have travelled to Nepal before falling ill. The coronavirus was detected during a postmortem examination. On Tuesday, Spain’s health ministry ordered that football and basketball matches involving teams from affected countries be played to empty stadiums and advised that large medical conferences and events should be cancelled to free up health professionals so they can attend to the coronavirus emergency. A fourth person – a 92-year-old man – has died in France after contracting the coronavirus; the health authorities have declared 212 confirmed cases in the country, a jump of 21 in 24 hours. Jérôme Salomon, the head of the country’s national health authority, said 13 regions are affected and there were three main clusters in mainland France: the largest in the Oise, north of Paris, where there are 64 cases, the Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan (12 cases). There is a fourth cluster made up of people who took part in an organised trip to Egypt, 11 cases. “The country has to hunker down. We are ready. I know we will know how to get through this, with strength and defiance,” President Emmanuel Macron told heath personnel running a crisis management centre on Tuesday evening. The president announced that France would be requisitioning “all stocks and production of protective masks” so they could be distributed to health workers and those who have been diagnosed with the virus. France’s sport minister Roxana Maracineanu called representatives of sports federations to a meeting on Tuesday to examine “case by case” whether events should go ahead. The Paris-Nice bike race due to take place between 8-15 March is still on for the moment. The Champions League football match between Paris Saint Germain and Dortmund on 11 March is also still happening, but the authorities are considering whether the match should take place without supporters. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted an update on Facebook on the steps the social network will take to respond to the coronavirus Facebook users who search for coronavirus on Facebook will see a pop-up that directs them to the WHO or local health authority for the latest information on the outbreak. The company will also give millions more in ad credits to other organisations. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said: We’re also focused on stopping hoaxes and harmful misinformation. It’s important that everyone has a place to share their experiences and talk about the outbreak, but as our community standards make clear, it’s not okay to share something that puts people in danger. So we’re removing false claims and conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations. We’re also blocking people from running ads that try to exploit the situation -- for example, claiming that their product can cure the disease. The budget airline Wizz Air, which has already cut some flights to Italy, could further reduce capacity by about 10% in its next quarter after demand was affected by the coronavirus outbreak Reuters reports the low-cost carrier said on Wednesday that it was difficult to predict the extent and duration of the outbreak and its impact on its next financial year, which begins next month. On Twitter, journalist Laurel Chor highlighted the lack of demand on some routes with an image of her flight from London to Milan on an unnamed airline. Poland has confirmed its first coronavirus infection, Reuters reports. Poland’s Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Wednesday that a man is in hospital in Zielona Gora, western Poland, and that his condition is good. The minister added that over 560 tests have been carried out so far and this is the only positive case, according to a report by local media. Hong Kong’s first evacuation flight for residents stuck in Hubei has taken off, and is on its way back to Hong Kong, journalist Alvin Lum has reported. 109 passengers were onboard the chartered Cathay Pacific plane, which left Wuhan’s international airport. One passenger presented with a high temperature and was prevented from boarding. The flight is expected to arrive shortly after 5pm, local time. On Wednesday Hong Kong’s chief executive announced that four flights would bring home the 533 trapped Hong Kongers, including 14 pregnant women, 22 residents who need medical treatment in Hong Kong including cancer patients, and 11 students needing to take an exam. Morning, I’m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Helen Sullivan. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has been doing the media rounds this morning to get a simple message out on how to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus – wash your hands regularly. Whitty told Sky News: “At the moment our advice is very clear. Although in the longer term we may well be needing people to take more extreme action, at this stage we do not think people need to change what they’re doing in terms of their normal behaviour.” He added that there will be a six-week period before the UK will start to see a significant amount of transmission of the virus. “Its almost certain there will be more cases in the UK, probably a lot more cases as the prime minister laid out and we would expect some deaths,” he said. When asked if people should be shaking hands, Whitty said: “The much more important thing is washing hands. Regular washing of hands with up to 20 seconds of soap is the key message we want to give people at this stage.” If you’re just joining us, here are the most important developments over the last few hours: The global death toll is now 3,190. More than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, reported 516 new cases on Wednesday, bringing its total to 5,328. In India, 17 Italian citizens have tested positive. There have been more infections recorded in Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Fears of a global recession are mounting, after stock markets gave a lukewarm reaction to the emergency cut in US interest rates and new data showed that China and Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill in February. Japan cancelled a ceremony commemorating the 2011 tsunami. The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people. Washington state residents are struggling to get tested. In Seattle, an Amazon employee tested positive for the virus. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, announced new screening measures, including for all travellers to the US on direct flights from South Korea and Italy. The WHO warned that supplies of protective gear “rapidly depleting”, amid panic-buying and the manipulation of markets. Panic-buying hit Australia, causing a rush on essentials, canned food, and toilet paper. Fears of a coronavirus-driven global economic slowdown have mounted after stock markets gave a lukewarm reaction to the emergency cut in US interest rates and new data showed that China and Hong Kong came to a virtual standstill in February. Shares in Asia struggled to gain traction despite the US Federal Reserve’s surprise 0.5% cut in borrowing costs. It is the first time the Fed has used an emergency cut outside its usual meeting schedule since the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and was aimed at steadying investor nerves after 10 days of heavy losses on financial markets. The World Bank also announced a $12bn package to assist countries grappling with the health and economic impacts. Helen Davidson and Martin Farrer report. Here are a few of the latest big developments in the global coronavirus outbreak. Read the full summary below. Total number of cases so far The global death toll is 3,190 while more than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries. In China there have been 38 new deaths bringing the total to 2,981 and there are 80,270 cases in all. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, reported 516 new cases on Wednesday, bringing its total to 5,328. In India, 15 Italian citizens have tested positive. There have been more infections recorded in Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Chinese services sector falls to lowest level since GFC The coronavirus lockdown has wiped out demand for shopping, eating out and going to the cinema in China, according to a key survey. WHO warns protective gear ‘rapidly depleting’ The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that masks, goggles and other protective equipment used by health workers are running out amid panic buying. Panic buying hits Australia Supermarket chain Woolworths has said it will start rationing toilet paper as panic buying leaves store shelves empty across the country, which has 41 cases of Covid-19. In India, fifteen Italian citizens have tested positive for coronavirus, Indian state and private media said on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources. Reuters reports that on Monday, an Italian citizen tested positive in the state of Rajasthan, according to a health official. In Australia, Queensland’s chief medical officer Jeanette Young has said that anyone who has travelled from Iran since the 19th of February must go into home quarantine for 14 days. The state has confirmed its 11th case of coronavirus, with a man who had visited Iran now isolated at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Authorities have begun contact tracing passengers who were seated close to him on the plane. “Nine contacts have been identified so far and that work is ongoing. The contacts that we really need to focus on now are those on the plane, the two rows in front, behind and either side of him,” said Young. Authorities would soon make the flight number public, she added. Here are today’s key developments: The WHO warned that protective gear “rapidly depleting”, amid panic buying and the manipulation of markets. South Korea has reported 516 new Covid-19 cases, a day after the president, Moon Jae-in, declared “war” on the illness. Mainland China confirmed 119 new cases. There were 38 new deaths from the virus on 3 March. China’s services sector collapsed in February to its lowest level since the global financial crisis. There are now 41 cases of the virus in Australia, including a health care worker at an aged care home in Sydney. The Australian government extended self-quarantine requirements for those recently arrived from Iran. A second case of coronavirus was confirmed in New Zealand, with the infected woman having recently arrived in the country from Italy. Japan’s total number of cases has hit 1,000, with one new case confirmed today. US Vice President Mike Pence announced new screening measures, including for all travellers to the US on direct flights from South Korea and Italy, as Washington state residents voiced their frustrations over obstacles to getting tested. On the latest episode of Today in Focus: Boris Johnson’s ‘battle plan’ for tackling a major outbreak of the coronavirus. The plan envisages the country close to a war footing, with schools closing, public gatherings cancelled and up to a fifth of the workforce off sick. The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, says that while these measures may never be needed, the plan shows how seriously the government is taking this crisis. But there is also a realisation that the virus will be extremely difficult to control and the best hope could lie in delaying the worst of the effects until a vaccine is produced. Professional sport, its stadia packed to the brim with fans at close quarters, is anything but immune to the coronavirus outbreak. The Tokyo Olympics have come under threat and Uefa has expressed concerns as Euro 2020 approaches, while cricketers have been advised not to shake hands and NBA players have been told to avoid high-fiving fans. Think of any sport – tennis, golf, rugby, cycling, baseball, biathlon even – and chances are it has been impacted by coronavirus in some capacity. To Australians, these have hitherto been other people’s problems. But as with most things, when the world sneezes Australia catches a cold. As another congested year of sport prepares to get even busier, fans should brace for a calendar that is at best disrupted, at worst decimated. The Guardian’s Hallie Golden reports that an Amazon employee in Seattle has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an internal message sent on Tuesday afternoon. The employee went home after feeling sick on 25 February, and has stayed out of the tech company’s offices ever since, according to the message from Amazon Human Resources, which was sent to most Amazon employees in the area and obtained by the Guardian. The employee is currently in quarantine. All other employees who came in close contact with the individual have been notified, according to the message. Japan will cancel a ceremony to mark the anniversary next week of the March 2011 triple disaster on its north-east coast, as part of government-led efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The national ceremony was due to be held in Tokyo on 11 March, exactly nine years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami killed more than 18,000 people and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In morale-boosting news from Iran, healthcare workers are posting videos of themselves dancing in their protective gear. In Australia, a 26-year-old man from Logan is in isolation in the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane after testing positive to Covid-19. It is the 11th confirmed coronavirus case in Queensland. The Queensland health department said the man had recently returned from Iran and is in a stable condition. Authorities are also awaiting the outcome of a test from the housemate of a 20-year-old man who tested positive to Covid-19 yesterday. Both the man and his housemate are in isolation at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital. The 63-year-old beautician who returned from Iran early last week also remains in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital, in a stable condition. The other eight patients have recovered. Queensland Health has urged anyone who has been overseas in the past 14 days and is feeling unwell to see a doctor immediately. People are recommended to call ahead to their GP or local hospital so they can prepare for the arrival of a potential coronavirus case. In Hong Kong, a monk from a worship hall linked to 16 of the region’s 100 confirmed cases has tested positive in a preliminary screening, South China Morning Post is reporting. The 43-year-old man is being treated in hospital, and is awaiting a second test to confirm the diagnosis. Hong Kong health authorities have previously said that 16 people diagnosed with Covid-19 had visited the hall, or were related to someone who had visited it. The South China morning post reports that a third doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital has died from Covid-19. Mei Zhongming, 57, was an opthamologist. Wuhan Central Hospital is the same one at which whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang worked. It is located close to the market where the virus was detected. Li died from Covid-19 in February. The New Zealand government said they will consider more hardship funding for businesses who are suffering from the impacts of coronavirus, as many experience a dip in income, including those in the tourism, seafood and logging industry. Today New Zealand confirmed its second case of coronavirus, in a woman in her 30s who had recently returned from northern Italy. Her partner is also being tested, as he is showing symptoms of the virus. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said that although it was concerning two local schools had to be alerted because of the latest case, transmission rates of the disease were low among young people. “We’re preparing for all the different scenarios,” Ardern said, of dealing with a coronavirus outbreak in schools. Ardern stressed the economy was still in good health, despite the upsets to the tertiary sector and various export industries. No further travel bans were announced, but Ardern said arrivals from affected areas were dropping “daily” as airlines put their own measures in place. New Zealand is asking travellers from northern Italy and south Korea to self-isolate. New Zealand’s travel restrictions were among the toughest in the world, Ardern said. There was no plan to ban or restrict travellers from Australia, where the disease was more widespread. Across the world, governments are ordering or contemplating school closures in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus virus. French officials closed about 120 schools in areas that have reported the largest numbers of infections, its education minister said on Tuesday. In some countries parents have already had their children at home for more than a month. Some have taken holidays or sent the kids overseas to relatives. Most Hong Kong schoolchildren never returned to school following the lunar new year holidays after the government announced and then extended closures to 20 April. So, how are parents coping? Helen Davidson, Lily Kuo and Justin McCurry report. In more toilet paper-related coronavirus news out of Australia, the social enterprise Who Gives a Crap, which delivers toilet paper made out of 100% recycled materials and donates 50% of its profits to build toilets in the developing world, has sold out of toilet paper. “With all the panic buying madness, we’ve sold out and are working as hard as possible to restock,” said the company on their website. They asked customers to consider “how we can all do our bit to encourage kindness, empathy and calm” in these “crazy times”. The news comes as Australia’s supermarkets have reported selling out of toilet paper as people stock up in anticipation of being stuck in home quarantine due to the coronavirus. Australian supermarket giant Woolworths has begun rationing the sale of toilet paper to four packets per customer. #toiletpapercrisis has been trending on Australian social media all Wednesday. The Australian health minister has told doctors who are facing shortages of protective face masks that they should contact their primary health network to gain access to the government’s stockpile of more than one million masks. Asked about reports that doctors and medical clinics are facing shortages of protective face masks, Greg Hunt said: “We have half a million masks in a first-round and in a second round we have allocated another 550,000 that are available to doctors through the primary health networks. If there are any GP practices that are having issues they should contact the Department of Health or first port of call will be their primary health network.” South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has cancelled his planned trip to the UAE, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March because of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. “In response to the recent nationwide spread of Covid-19, we have decided not to go ahead with trips,” said presidential blue house spokesman Kang Min-seok in a statement. Just looking back at the press conference given just after noon by the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard and the chief medical officer Kerry Chant; the key take-away is there are now two cases in that state of people being infected with coronavirus where the infection can not be traced back to a source. This means community transmission has occurred, though the community transmission has so far been contained in both cases – there is no widespread infection occurring. The latest case of community transmission involves a 50-year-old woman working at the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility in northern Sydney. She had not travelled to an affected country. On Monday, a 53-year-old doctor working at Ryde hospital was also diagnosed, and again he had not travelled to an infected country. Neither had knowingly been in contact with an infected person. The press conference revealed some journalists are confused about how the disease is spread, with Chant and Hazzard grilled about how they could be sure the disease was not spreading around Ryde hospital and the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge. This is concerning, because people may avoid seeking medical treatment of visiting loved ones if they believe there is a risk of becoming infected. Chant reiterated that there is no ongoing threat of infection at either of the facilities. First of all, only close contacts of infected people are at risk. A close contact is defined as someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes with an infected person, or in the same closed space with an infected person for at least two hours without protective gear. Once you remove an infected person and their close contacts from a facility or isolate them in hospital rooms, and disinfect surfaces, there is no longer any ongoing risk of infection. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most sick, so out of caution health authorities trace back an infected person’s close contacts to the day prior to them falling ill. “Coronavirus is not in the hospital and you will do more harm if you don’t present to the hospital because you’re scared of coronavirus,” Chant said. She also made an important point; isolation, testing and quarantine measures are not designed to go on forever. If more widespread community transmission occurs -- and health authorities are preparing for that becoming the case -- the messages to the public and measures taken by health authorities would change, Chant said. At the point of community spread, rather than diagnosing every person with symptoms, people who felt sick would be encouraged to stay at home and isolate themselves for 14 days. They would only need to call a doctor if they became worse.They should at that point alert ambulance or health workers on the phone ahead of time so health care workers could put measures in place such as wearing protective gear. “While we have a strong emphasis on testing at this point in time we won’t be if there is community spread at significant levels,” Chant said. “It’s important the community understands the message will change depending on the circumstances. It’s not because we don’t know what we’re doing. We ask that the community follows our messages.” There is still no need for members of the community to change their behaviour. Anyone with concerns can call the Coronavirus Health Information Line on 1800 020 080. Australia extends self-quarantine requirements for those recently arrived from Iran Australia’s health minister Greg Hunt says it has become clear that in Iran “there is an uncontrolled spread” of the virus and as a result, the “requirements in relation to people who have travelled to Iran has now been extended”. “That means that any person who has arrived in Australia having been in Iran from February 19 forward will be required to conduct home isolation, as has been the case with people from China, and has been the case with people from Iran from March 1. But they will be required to do that for 14 days from arrival in Australia, and that will now take effect for everybody who has arrived in Australia from and including February 19. Hunt said the Australian government had extended this quarantine order: “out of an abundance of caution, but recognising that the situation in Iran is clearly far worse than has been documented and significantly higher than the recorded case numbers.” Australia has 41 cases of Covid-19, says health minister Australia’s health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now. He confirms that as of today Australia has 41 cases of Covid-19, including the worker in the aged care facility in Macquarie Park in New South Wales that we reported on earlier. “At this point, the advice I have is that they have isolated all of the relevant residents who have been in contact,” said Hunt. Two residents of the home are under investigation, including a 95-year-old who died last night. “At this stage, NSW Health has not identified whether that resident has in any way, shape or form, been subject to coronavirus, but for full transparency, they have identified that case as one for investigation,” Another resident has been placed in hospital for respiratory conditions and will be tested for coronavirus. Hunt said that globally, the numbers have increased to over 92,000 cases with over 3,100 lives lost and has now spread to over 78 countries. Among the countries that have seen their first cases of the virus are Ukraine and Morocco. Australia Institute chief economist Richard Denniss argues that the country is on the edge of a recession not because of coronavirus, but because the economy has been languishing since 2013. “If you thought the prime minister was slow to respond to the bushfire crisis, take a look at his response to Australia’s ailing economy,” he writes. “Morrison is currently trying to pivot away from the government’s economic inaction using the coronavirus outbreak as cover, but the only reason the coronavirus might push Australia into recession is because the economy has been languishing since the Coalition took office.” China’s services sector collapsed in February to its lowest level since the global financial crisis as the coronavirus lockdown wiped out demand for shopping, eating out and going to the cinema, a key survey showed on Wednesday local time. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) almost halved last month to 26.5 from 51.8 in January, Reuters reports. It was the first drop below the 50-point margin on a monthly basis for the first time since the survey began almost 15 years ago in late 2005. A reading over 50 indicates expansion while a reading below means the sector is shrinking. “Stagnating consumption amid the coronavirus epidemic has had a great impact on the service sector,” Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin PMI release. The Hong Kong private sector PMI also confirmed it is heading further into recession. It fell to 33.1 in February from 46.8 in January. In Mainland China, 119 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed on March 3. This is lower than yesterday, when 125 new cases were confirmed – at the time, the lowest number of new daily cases since January. There were 38 new deaths, bringing the total number of deaths to 2,981. The total number of cases stands at 80,270 as of the end of March 3. South Korea reported 516 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the country’’s total to 5,328, a day after the president, Moon Jae-in, declared “war” on the illness. South Korea - which has the highest number of infections outside China - has recorded 32 deaths, mostly among older people with underlying illnesses, Yonhap news agency said, citing figures from the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The government has proposed an extra budget of 11.7tn won (US9.8bn) to address the spread of the virus and limit its impact on the economy. The extra budget will be submitted to the national assembly on Thursday, with government officials urging MPs to pass the measures as quickly as possible. About 60% of South Korea’s infections have been linked to a branch of the Shincheonji religious sect in the southeastern city of Daegu, although testing has been widened to include people in the city who re not connected with the sect, Yonhap said. Of the 516 new cases announced on Wednesday, 405 were in Daegu and 89 were in neighboring North Gyeongsang province, the KCDC said. In Washington state, where the coronavirus has claimed nine lives, residents on Tuesday reported a frustrating array of misinformation and obstacles as they were seeking to get tested. The virus has claimed nine lives in the state. Our reporter Hallie Golden spoke to residents in Seattle: A second case of coronavirus has been confirmed in New Zealand, with the infected woman having recently arrived in the country from Italy. The latest infection is a New Zealand citizen, a woman in her early 30s who recently returned from a trip to northern Italy and rapidly became ill. The woman’s partner is also showing symptoms of the illness, health authorities said today, and is currently being tested. Here is our full story: US Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that US public health authorities had issued new guidance to make clear that a doctor’s order was all that would be needed for any American to be tested for the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. The US would also begin screening all travellers coming to the US on direct flights from Italy and South Korea, he said. International travel to the United States will drop 6% over the next three months amid growing concerns about the outbreak, the US Travel Association forecast on Tuesday. The drop would be the largest decline in international inbound travel since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The chief executives of several major US airlines are scheduled to meet with Pence at the White House on Wednesday. American Airlines stock is down 40% since mid-February, and shares were down 2.8% on Tuesday. United Airlines shares, which fell 3.5% Tuesday, are down 28% since mid-February. The stocks of major hotel and cruise line companies have also fallen sharply. Pence is scheduled to meet with cruise line executives in Florida on Saturday. More on the situation in Australia: Dr Kerry Chant, NSW chief medical officer, said, “We have obviously had an increased number of cases reported from travellers returning overseas. In some of those cases, we will – we are initiating, and have commenced, contact tracing procedures in relation to the plane.” She added that a list of the flight numbers and the rows of concern would be published on the NSW health ministry’s website, with advice for travellers. “So, people seated in the same row as a case, or in the two rows in front or the two rows behind a confirmed COVID-19 case are defined as close contacts and are advised to self-quarantine at home for 14 days of the flight, and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms are present,” she explained. The rest of passengers on those flights would be advised to self-monitor for symptoms for two weeks after the flight. In Australia, here’s Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer for New South Wales, speaking at the conference. In Australia health officials say a health worker at an old people’s home in Sydney has been infected with the new coronavirus. Brad Hazzard, New South Wales health minister, said the “much-loved” and longstanding member of staff at a residential care home has been confirmed as having the virus. She had been working with 13 residents at Dorothy Henderson Lodge, which is part of Baptist Care in Macquarie Park. Eleven of the residents have since been isolated. The other two residents presented with respiratory symptoms, Hazzard said at a media conference in Sydney, but it was not clear whether they had the virus. One of them, a 95-year-old woman, has died and the other is being tested. One of those was a 95-year-old lady who has passed away. Now, whether or not it was related to corona, we don’t know at this point. And another resident who is being tested currently. The health worker has not been overseas, raising the question of how she ended up with coronavirus, Hazzard said. She was working on around about 24 February when she started to get those symptoms that I was just talking about – the sort of symptoms that we’re all very familiar with, with flu,” said Hazzard. “And so we did the checks. And, of course, we’re aware that it’s likely that she could have been capable of passing on the coronavirus from at least the day before, 24 hours, so that’s 23 February. The reaction of Asia Pacific stocks – or lack of it – to the US Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut means we’re in for another volatile day’s trading on the financial markets. Shares in Sydney are down 1.7%, although in Tokyo, where trading has just started, the market is pretty flat at 0.6% and in Seoul the Kospi index is up 1.39%. However, futures trading points to a fall in Hong Kong later. The Fed’s move out of its usual meeting schedule is extremely rare. The last time they did this was at the height of Lehman crisis in 2008. So the fact they’ve acted in such a way and for it to have so little impact is worrying. Fear is back, as Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natiixis bank in Hong Kong says: Kyle Rodda, of IG Markets in Melbourne, says market sentiment has been adversely affected by the Fed’s 50 basis point cut, which has not calmed concerns about a global recession: “The Fed’s 50-pointer initially supported market sentiment, as investors got a little giddy on the prospect of cheaper money. But the fundamental concerns about the coronavirus, and whether monetary policy would really stop a slow-down in the US and global economy, prevailed. The Vix volatility index spiked once again, to trade back around the 40 mark – a level entirely unconducive taking confident long positions in risk assets. Underlining official concern about Covid-19’s impact on the world economy, the World Bank has announced a $12bn package to assist countries grappling with the health and economic impacts. World Bank president David Malpass said there were still “many unknowns” about the fast-spreading virus and “much more” aid might be required, but he declined to elaborate. “The point is to move fast; speed is needed to save lives,” Malpass said during a teleconference with reporters. “There are scenarios where much more resources may be required. We’ll adapt our approach and resources as needed.” Japan has confirmed another case of coronavirus infection, bringing the total in the country to 1,000 cases, Reuters reports. This number includes those from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had been quarantined off Yokohama. In Australia, Brendan Murphy, the country’s chief medical officer, has just been telling the federal parliament in Canberra that the government is doing what it can to replenish stocks of protective clothing and equipment for health workers. The other dimension in preparation is there is a worldwide concern about the availability of personal protective equipment, you know, masks and the like, which there has obviously been a run on an government is very focused on making sure we enhance and build greater our stocks. We’ve always had a stockpile and the states have stockpiles ... We are doing a full assessment of that and making sure that we buy more and do what we can to be prepared for every eventuality.” Speaking more generally about the outbreak, he said: The focus is on containment, limitation and slowing any spread. We can keep the situation under control. We are a well prepared health system but even the best system can face a challenge.” The World Health Organization has voiced concern that the masks, googles and other protective equipment used by health workers is running out amid panic buying and the manipulation of markets, warning that supplies are “rapidly depleting”, Reuters reports. “We are concerned that countries’ abilities to respond are being compromised by the severe and increasing disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment ... caused by rising demand, hoarding and misuse,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting our health workers,” he said. The prices of surgical masks have increased six-fold, while the cost for ventilators had tripled, he added. Tedros said that WHO had shipped more than half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but urged a dramatic hike in production. The WHO estimates the response to Covid-19 will require 89 million medical masks, 76 million pairs of examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles each month. More than 3,100 people have died from the new virus, while over 92,000 have been infected across 77 countries and territories, according to AFP’s latest toll based on official sources. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus. Today the World Heath Organization has warned that there is a global shortage of the protective equipment needed to fight the coronavirus. Governments worldwide are mobilising to protect economies from recession. Here is the summary from the last few hours. Iran will mobilise 300,000 soldiers and volunteers to against the country’s outbreak, the deadliest outside China, as 2,300 cases are confirmed, including 23 MPs. Australia’s sharemarket dropped 1.4% after the opening bell on Wednesday, despite the US Fed cut in interest rates. The losses reversed a rally on Tuesday that followed more than a week of losses. A ninth person with coronavirus has died in Seattle in the US. The person died six days ago, but the infection was only detected later. New York has identified its second case. Spain confirmed its first death from the new coronavirus. The man died almost three weeks ago, with new tests confirming the virus as the cause. New cases were identified in Algeria, Ireland, and Chile. Algeria’s total number of cases now stands at eight. Ireland’s stands at two. Chile’s case is the country’s first. The death toll from coronavirus in Italy has risen by 27 over the past 24 hours to 79. The total number of cases in the country reached 2,502, up from 2,036 on Monday. The agency said that of those infected, 160 people had fully recovered.

More than 3,000 spent nuclear fuel rods are kept inside metal casks within towering concrete containers in an open-air yard close to a perimeter fence at Zaporizhia, the Guardian discovered on a recent visit to the plant, which is 124 miles (200km) from the current front line. “With a war around the corner, it is shocking that the spent fuel rod containers are standing under the open sky, with just a metal gate and some security guards waltzing up and down for protection,” said Patricia Lorenz, a Friends of the Earth nuclear spokeswoman who visited the plant on a fact-finding mission. “I have never seen anything like it,” she added. “It is unheard of when, in Germany, interim storage operators have been ordered by the court to terror-proof their casks with roofs and reinforced walls.” Industry experts said that ideally the waste store would have a secondary containment system such as a roof. Ukraine’s conflict in Donbass is 124 miles away from the plant, but Gustav Gressel, a fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations thinks the front line is too far away – for now – to be at risk from fighting. However, locals still fear for the potential consequences if the conflict was to spread in the plant’s direction. Just three decades ago, an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant north of Kiev released a radioactive cloud that poisoned vast tracts of land. “People are scared because the conflict zone is quite near,” Vasiliy Ivanovic, a former policeman turned environmental volunteer told the Guardian. “If Putin wants to connect Russia to the Crimea, the route goes through Mariupol. The Russian troops are already near there, and they have missiles that could hit the power plant.” Ukrainian forces repelled attacks by Russian-backed separatist rebels in Mariupol a year ago, but two Ukrainian troops were injured during clashes in the strategic port city earlier this month. Any separatist offensive in the region could threaten the Zaporizhia plant because of Russian military tactics. Initial barrages against frontline positions are often followed with bombardments of possible lines of defence. “The Russians use a large amount of multiple rocket-propelled systems that are not entirely precise, and they don’t really care where they land,” said Gressel. The Zaporizhia plant might itself be used as a defensive position by fleeing Ukrainian soldiers he said, adding: “Of course, there could be a natural disaster if the fighting comes there.” Plant security at Zaporizhia is now at a ‘high readiness’ level, while air force protection and training exercises have been stepped up. Officials say that if fighting reaches the plant, there are plans for the closure of access roads and deployment of soldiers. But they say that no containment design could take the stresses of military conflict into account. “Given the current state of warfare, I cannot say what could be done to completely protect installations from attack, except to build them on Mars,” Sergiy Bozhko, the chairman of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told the Guardian. “Ukraine’s plan is to withstand and win,” he added. Zaporizhia’s storage unit was built to a US design specification that involved rigorous testing for the possibility of a terrorist attack. The US Sandia Lab tests considered scenarios up to airliner impact, although the results remain classified, Neil Hyatt, a professor of radioactive waste management at Sheffield University, told the Guardian. However, a dry storage container with a resilient roof and in-house ventilation would offer greater protection from missile bombardment, he said – so long as the structure was designed that way from the start. “You would need to prepare adequate foundations to accommodate the substantive structure required, so I doubt this could be retrofitted at Zaporoizhia with the casks in place,” Hyatt said. “You would need to build a [new] purpose structure and then move the casks to the structure.” Antony Froggatt, a senior research fellow and European nuclear specialist at Chatham House agreed that a secondary containment system would offer greater protection from internal or external explosions. “It is obvious that if you do not have an array of dry cast [interim] stores with secondary containment around it, then that will have a greater risk of release of radioactive material,” he said. But installing these would “be a very expensive decision,” according to Nikolai Steinberg, a prominent Ukrainian nuclear expert and former energy vice-minister. “I think it is not necessary,” he said. Sources at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) told the Guardian that any funding request from Ukraine for such a structure would be seriously considered. The bank has already made €300m available for nuclear lifetime extension programmes in Ukraine, before the regulators have even signed off on them. A pall was cast over security arrangements at Zaporizhia last May when the plant was the scene of an armed confrontation between security guards and paramilitaries from the ultra-nationalist ‘right sector’, which is allied with neo-Nazi groups. The gunmen reportedly wanted to ‘protect’ the plant from pro-Russian forces, but were stopped by guards at a checkpoint. “We have several risky nuclear materials [at Zaporizhia],” said Sergei Shegin, the plant’s chief reactor specialist. “As well as the reactors, we have spent nuclear fuel and all possible measures should be taken. As technical specialists, we know about the weak links in the plant [security], and there are some. But I doubt that these should be disclosed.” Around 770,000 people live in the city of Zaporizhia and safety issues have risen to the fore among local people. Most support the reactor for the jobs it provides, but environmental concerns have grown since a plant shutdown in December amid rumours of a radiation leak, which were denied by the company. The share of Ukrainian electricity provided by nuclear rose by around 10% in the last year, as conflict in the Donbass region threw Russian gas supplies into doubt. Coal supplies too had to be tortuously re-routed from Ukraine’s east through Russia, to keep up a pretence they are being sourced internationally and avoid the impression of buying energy direct from the separatist rebels who are fighting Ukrainian soldiers. As a result, uranium fuel supplies are fast becoming a new east-west battlefield in the post-Soviet great energy game. “Nuclear energy is the only possible option for us to replace the generated electricity that we lost [from coal and gas],” a government source told the Guardian. “After the start of open war with Russia, it was understood that all our other strategies in the energy sphere would become impossible.” Some 60% of Ukraine’s electricity is now produced by 15 ageing reactors – concentrated in four giant plants. Nine of these will reach the end of their design lifetimes in the next five years, and three have already. Most of Ukraine’s nuclear fleet depends on Russia’s Rosatom to supply its enriched uranium fuel – and to whisk away the resulting radioactive waste for storage. “Nuclear fuel is the only sphere in which cooperation remains friendly, constructive and successful because Ukraine is one of Russia’s biggest clients,” said Roman Rukomeda, a political analyst. “It is an issue of money.” But as fear and loathing in the war-torn region grow, government sources say that in the long term, Ukraine aims to forge a three-way split in nuclear fuel supply contracts between US-company Westinghouse, European companies, such as Areva, and Rosatom. This creates its own safety issues. One key Ukrainian reactor will be mothballed next month, until concerns about nuclear fuel provided by Westinghouse have been resolved. The 1,000MW Chernobyl-era reactor in the South Ukraine plant was last week denied a lifetime extension until the state energy company, Energoatom, provides data to the SNRIU nuclear watchdog about Westinghouse fuel trials, operations and core reactor conditions afterwards. The regulator listed several other safety limitations and deficiencies brought on by the plant’s ageing components, including 33 ‘deviations’ from current nuclear and radiation safety norms. With war and an energy tilt to the West narrowing energy security options though, the shutdown is expected to be short-lived. Security sources say that Rosatom may remain Kiev’s biggest single partner but it will definitely lose its monopoly in the years ahead, and Westinghouse’s share of uranium fuel supplies will grow. Last December, the US firm signed a memo with Ukraine to “significantly increase fuel deliveries” to Ukrainian plants, though the details are sketchy. A similar deal was signed with the French nuclear company Areva on 24 April. But fears of Russian retaliation have dogged past plans to shift supply or disposal contracts to the West, and market diversification will be a slow process. “There is always a threat that it can become a political issue and Russia could stop their contracts,” one source said. “The Americans are proposing that their company Westinghouse substitute for Rosatom, but warning us that it will take one or two years to produce the fuel, so we will need at least one year’s supply in storage.” The US has provided technology, training and hundreds of millions of dollars to help Ukraine’s push for fuel diversification, according to a US diplomatic cable from 2009, published by Wikileaks. Westinghouse has also lobbied the Ukrainian government at ministerial level to commit to buying their fuel for at least five reactors. Plant managers say that it will be used in Zaporizhia by 2017. But local people in the reactor’s shadow say they fear the consequences of a patched up Soviet-era plant cranking up to generate electricity into the 2020s. “History teaches us that history doesn’t teach us anything,” Ivanovic said. “Another catastrophe could happen again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-24T12:44:21Z","webTitle":"George Osborne puts UK at the heart of global race for mini-nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne puts UK at the heart of global race for mini-nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The UK could be the global centre of a new nuclear industry in mini-reactors that are trucked into a town near you to provide your hot water, or shipped to any country that wants to plug them into their electricity grid from the dock. The chancellor, George Osborne, revealed on Wednesday that at least £250m will be spent by 2020 on an “ambitious” programme to “position the UK as a global leader in innovative nuclear technologies”. There will be a competition to identify the best value design of mini reactors - called small modular reactors (SMRs) - and paving the way “towards building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s”. There is no shortage of contenders, with companies from the US to China and Poland all wooing the UK with their proposals. With a crucial UN climate change summit in Paris imminent, the question of how to keep the lights on affordably, while cutting emissions, is pressing. SMRs aim to capture the advantages of nuclear power – always-on, low-carbon energy – while avoiding the problems, principally the vast cost and time taken to build huge plants. Current plants, such as the planned French-Chinese Hinkley Point project in Somerset, have to be built on-site, a task likened to “building a cathedral within a cathedral”. Instead, SMRs, would be turned out by the dozen in a factory, then transported to sites and plugged in, making them – in theory – cheaper. Companies around the world, including in Russia, South Korea and Argentina, are now trying to turn that theory into practice and many are looking at the nuclear-friendly UK as the place to make it happen. “There’s a lot of terrific things about the UK market that makes it the right place to deploy new nuclear technology,” said Tom Mundy, head of programme development at US company NuScale, one of the frontrunners. “It’s got a government committed to reducing carbon and seeing nuclear as one of the solutions, and it has got a substantial and pre-eminent legacy of nuclear operations – a trained and capable workforce and a nuclear supply chain.” The UK has commissioned five studies since July, costing £4.5m, to explore the potential of SMRs and energy secretary Amber Rudd told MPs earlier this month: “We are fully enthused about SMRs. We are doing as much as we can in terms of supporting the technology. SMRs would be an excellent way forward.” A government-funded report from the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) in December 2014 suggested there was potentially a “very significant” global market for hundreds of SMRs (65-85 gigawatts) by 2035, with dozens of the SMRs (7GW) sited in the UK. This market would be worth £250-£400bn, the NNL estimated, saying it represented an economic opportunity for UK plc. SMRs are reactors that produce less than 300MW (0.3GW) of electricity, much smaller than the 1,000MW (1GW) of many existing nuclear plants. An additional advantage is that SMRs can vary their output quickly, meaning they could be used to balance intermittent wind and solar energy, unlike big nuclear plants. Small reactors have been operated for more than 50 years, particularly on military submarines and ships. But, Mundy said: “The application they are designed for is completely different from civil nuclear electricity.” Small reactors have also run a remote site at Bilibino in Siberia since 1976, with the excess steam supplying a district heating system, while a US base in Antarctica was powered by a tiny reactor in the 1960s. But no true SMRs, rolling off a factory assembly line, have yet been built. Determining the best companies for SMR designs means looking for scale and experience, says Giorgio Locatelli, at the University of Leeds. He points to US nuclear giant Westinghouse, NuScale, Korea – which has signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia – and the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). “The Chinese government has a pile of money to invest,” Locatelli said. Danrong Song, CNNC’s chief designer for SMRs, attended an SMR conference in London in October and pitched a “technical plan and proposal for cooperation with UK industry” – the company is already cooperating with Rolls Royce. This plan would see the first CNNC SMR produced in the UK, with subsequent SMRs being sold around the world, he said, mirroring the plan to build a large Chinese nuclear plant at Bradwell in Essex. Song said China itself could provide a big market: “A lot of air pollution in China is caused by fossil fuel plants, so with SMRs we can reduce that.” Large nuclear plants needed a lot of cooling water and were therefore mainly built on the coast, he said, limiting their use. “But inland, you can build SMRs and use air cooling,” Song said. CNNC’s design, the ACP100+, would produce 120MW of electricity, be refuelled every two years and could even be put on a ship, said Song. CNNC signed an agreement with Lloyd’s Register in October to develop marine nuclear regulations. Such ships could be floating power plants, said Kristiina Soderholm, at Finnish energy company Fortum, which runs several nuclear plants. She said an SMR could be put on a barge, taken to a country, plugged into grid from the port and then, when its fuel was used up, sail back again. “For newcomer countries [to nuclear], that could be a very attractive way to do it,” she said. It has happened before: in the late 1960s a former US military nuclear-powered ship moored by the Panama canal and provided onshore electricity. Russia, which has long experience of marine nuclear power, has been promising a floating SMR for several years. But the project has been repeatedly delayed, although it is unclear whether the reason is technical or financial. Westinghouse, part of Toshiba and one of the world’s biggest nuclear companies, is staying on land with its 225MW (electricity) SMR, which it says could be deployed by 2027. “There’s a unique opportunity for the UK to move from being a buyer to a provider, said Jeff Benjamin, head of new build and major programmes. “We hope the build out of our SMR will happen here in the UK … but then use this as a base to export globally.” Westinghouse made a proposal to the UK in October to put its designs into a new company in which the UK government and industry took a stake and then shared the development costs. “This is what is going to be necessary to move this market forward in the UK,” said Benjamin. “We are not asking the UK government to swallow the elephant all at once.” UK ministers are considering the offer. One big potential customer in Europe is coal-dependent Poland, seen as the biggest nuclear market in Europe and often chastised internationally for its reluctance to reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change. “I want to persuade the UK to partner with Poland: it has the skills, we have the need,” Grzegorz Wrochna, director of Poland’s National Centre for Nuclear Research, told the London summit. Compared to Westinghouse’s SMR, that from NuScale is much smaller – 50MW of electricity. This to maximise the number of places it can be sited, said Mundy, with the 23m-long unit being “the biggest you can get on the road”. If more power is needed, multiple reactors could be be installed side-by-side. The company, backed by a $217m (£143m) cost-sharing deal from the US Department of Energy (DoE), aims to start generating electricity for its first customer in Idaho by 2023, Mundy said. Other SMR contenders include US-based Generation mPower, also backed by the US DoE, while more novel technology, such as that from Bill Gates-backed Terrapower, are seen as prospects further in the future. The pilot plant closest to completion is CAREM in Argentina and was initially intended for use in submarines. But for all the activity, the nascent SMR industry faces familiar nuclear challenges: cost, public acceptability, security and waste disposal. The nuclear industry has a long record of broken promises over cost – Hinkley-type reactors being built by EDF in France and Finland are billions over budget and years behind schedule. Developing SMRs is not going to be cheap either. Design alone will cost £500m, estimates David Orr, head of nuclear business development at UK engineering firm Rolls Royce, which is “actively engaged” in the technology. He said 40-70 SMRs would need to be ordered to make building a factory worthwhile. Industry figures say the cost of electricity from the first SMRs should be about the same as large nuclear power plants, then get cheaper. But Locatelli said: “We don’t yet know if the cost of electricity from an SMR is going to be cheaper than from big plants, but the risk is lower” because the capital needed is smaller. All the while, the competition from renewable energy gets hotter as it falls in price. Most new energy projects – from nuclear to fracking to windfarms – face some opposition. But Professor Andrew Sherry, chief scientist at the UK’s NNL said: “Political support for [large nuclear power plants] has been unified and public support is quite strong.” However, SMRs could be much closer to people’s homes, he said, and might be used to provide hot water for central heating as well as electricity. “Small factory-built nuclear plants could be located closer, say within 20 to 40 miles, to users and provide a combined heat and power function,” said former UK environment secretary Owen Paterson in 2014. Sherry asks: “Would people accept district heating from nuclear?” Security is also a key issue for nuclear plants. Canada’s Bruce Power runs the biggest operational nuclear site in the world in Ontario, with 6.3GW of capacity across eight reactors. Protecting the site requires armed guards and Frank Saunders, head of nuclear oversight and regulatory affairs at Bruce Power, said the company has “the largest tactical unit outside the military” in the province. The challenge for SMRs is that security costs soar relative to power output if there are small reactors in many locations to protect. “The security costs are hugely magnified when you go to smaller units,” said Saunders. While SMRs may need refuelling less frequently – potentially decades – and use uranium more efficiently than earlier generations of reactor, the permanent disposal of nuclear waste remains a vexed issue around the world. No deep geological repository has yet gained final approval. Despite the challenges, engineer Gordon Waddington, who led the NNL report, is confident SMRs have a future because of the demand for low-carbon electricity. For example, he said: “I am absolutely certain that China will get very good at [SMRs]. They need it and they will get there.” Waddington said the next two to three years are critical if SMRs are to be deployed widely in the next decade, and the UK has a once-in-a-generation chance to be at the heart of it: “The window of opportunity for the UK is there – but it will not be open forever.” This article was amended on Thursday 26 November to include the most recent announcements made by George Osborne in the spending review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2016/dec/28/brexit-strikes-and-pay-revolts-the-year-in-business","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-28T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Brexit, strikes and pay revolts: the year in business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/dec/28/brexit-strikes-and-pay-revolts-the-year-in-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2016/dec/28/brexit-strikes-and-pay-revolts-the-year-in-business","fields":{"headline":"Brexit, strikes and pay revolts: the year in business","bodyText":"2016 will forever be remembered as the year of the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s election as US president. Both events sent shock waves through financial markets and will have repercussions for businesses in the year ahead. Even without the political turmoil, 2016 was a dramatic year for business leaders. The collapse of BHS led to intense pressure on Sir Philip Green and demands that he fill the £571m hole in the store chain’s pension fund, while Mike Ashley was summoned before MPs to explain the working practices the Guardian had exposed at Sport Direct’s Derbyshire warehouse. The annual general meeting season started with a bang when two FTSE 100 companies – BP and Smith &amp; Nephew – had their pay schemes voted down. There were also big events in industry, with Nissan securing a post-Brexit deal, approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station and concerns over the commitment of Indian company Tata to its UK steel plants. So as the year draws to close, who were the winners and losers in the business world in 2016 – and who has most at stake in the year ahead? Losers No sooner had 2016 begun, that Marc Bolland, the chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, announced he was leaving. His successor, M&amp;S lifer Steve Rowe, scaled back the retailer’s international expansion and announced plans to close stores and convert 45 sites into food-only outlets. By the end of the year, Robert Swannell, the chairman, announced his retirement. It was not long before another chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox also left. She walked away from the investment trust firm Alliance Trust in March when her role became obsolete in a restructuring that followed a long-lasting tussle with activist investors. By the end of the year, the Dundee-based firm outlined a dramatic plan to outsource the management of its investment funds. Ruby McGregor-Smith stepped aside after a decade running outsourcing company Mitie. The company said she had doubled profits and revenues during her tenure – but the shine was taken off by a profit warning three weeks earlier that knocked 25% of the share price. Phil Bentley, who used to run British Gas and Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, took over. Bosses at a string of companies faced revolts. Besides BP and Smith &amp; Nephew, companies as diverse as engineering group Weir, Shire Pharmaceuticals, estate agent Foxtons and betting company Paddy Power Betfair were also subjected to pay rebellions. Ashley’s problems began at the end of 2015, when the Guardian revealed how his retail empire was effectively paying below the minimum wage. He spent 2016 dealing with the consequences. The Newcastle United owner was hauled before MPs, and at an open day at his warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, he stunned observers by producing a wad of £50 notes from his pocket during a security check. The company’s shares have crumbled from about 570p to below 300p. There has been better news for Sports Direct workers, who have been promised back pay. For BHS workers, though, the news was dire. In August, BHS tores closed their doors for the last time after 88 years of trading. A parliamentary inquiry was looking into why the chain collapsed barely a year after being sold by Sir Philip Green to the thrice-bankrupt entrepreneur Dominic Chappell. A damning report by MPs concluded the business had been subjected to “systematic plunder” by former owners. MPs voted to strip Green of his knighthood, although the vote was purely symbolic and carried no official sanction. A deal to plug a £571m deficit in the pension fund is yet to be secured. Navinder Singh Sarao spent most of the year fighting extradition to face charges that he had been “spoofing” markets from his parents’ house in Hounslow, west London. Eventually extradited, Sarao appeared in a Chicago court and pleaded guilty. Martyn Dodgson’s conviction for insider dealing was secured using evidence from bugged offices, CCTV images and a crucial password of “Lamborghini55”. The former Deutsche Bank managing director was jailed for four and half years. His friend Andrew Hind was jailed for three and half years for acting as his middleman. Three others were acquitted. Four former Barclays bankers were sentenced to between 33 months and six-and-a-half years in jail for conspiring to rig global benchmark interest rates. Just before Christmas, former BlackRock fund manager Mark Lyttleton was jailed for a year after pleading guilty to insider dealing through a Panamanian company in the name of his wife. The pound plunged after the vote to leave the EU and is down 15% against the dollar, a fall not helped by October’s “flash crash” when the currency dived to new 31-year lows. Winners Andrew Bailey’s year started with his unexpected appointment as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Poached from the Bank of England, where he was one of the deputy governors, Bailey made a number of eye-catching moves after taking the helm in the summer. Crowdfunding, the fund management industry, high-cost consumer credit and the spread-betting industry are in his sights. Executives enjoyed big pay days. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising company WPP, received £70.4m in cash and shares. It was one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history – and was opposed by a third of the company’s shareholders. Simon Segars and Mike Muller at ARM Holdings shared a payout of £55m when the British microchip designer was sold to Japan’s SoftBank for £24bn. Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris, the founders of luxury chocolate maker Hotel Chocolat, received £43m when the business was floated on AIM in May. And after a difficult 2015, Ivan Glasenberg, boss of mining company Glencore, had a good end to 2016 as the share price in the natural resources group rallied from from 85p to about 270p, boosting the value of his personal shareholding from £1bn to £3.2bn. Carmaker Nissan secured a deal from the government to seek tariff-free access to the single market when EU exit negotiations start. The Japanese company announced it would turn its Sunderland factory into one of the biggest car plants in the world, saving more than 7,000 jobs. While the news was good for Nissan workers, the prospects for workers at Tata Steel’s plants were mixed. The Scunthorpe works was saved by a rescue deal in June, led by Greybull, the family investment firm. In Port Talbot, workers are still awaiting confirmation of a deal with the Pensions Regulator. The on-off Hinkley Point C nuclear power station was finally given the go-ahead after the government signed an £18bn contract with French utilities firms EdF and China to start construction at the site in Somerset. The European commission fought back against complex tax arrangements by ruling a sweetheart deal devised by the Irish government had allowed Apple to pay tax of just 0.005% in 2014 and an average rate of 1% over many years. However, the competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, later said the full amount may not be payable to Ireland. In the empire-building stakes, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s won control of Argos, Shire Pharmaceuticals took over Baxalta, ABInBev, the world’s biggest brewer, completed its £79bn acquisition of SAB Miller and as the year drew to a close, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox lodged an £11.7bn bid to take full control of Sky. The London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse also announced a merger. Ones to watch Emma Walmsley Even before she gets started as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, Walmsley is already being described as the most powerful woman in the FTSE 100. When she takes charge in March, Walmsley faces shareholders pushing for a breakup of the pharmaceutical business. Her background is in the consumer arm: Sensodyne toothpaste, Horlicks malted drinks and Panadol painkillers. Paula Nickolds Nickolds is taking over as the first female chief executive of John Lewis, replacing Andy Street, who has stepped down to run as the Tory candidate for mayor of Birmingham. Nickolds, who once considered a teaching career, started as a graduate trainee at John Lewis in 1994 and climbed the ladder through buying roles in clothing and furniture, before becoming buying and brand director. In the latter role, Nickolds had responsibility for the all-important Christmas ad, including 2013’s bear and the hare animation. She was named commercial director last year, with responsibility for shops and product development. It’s a big gig, running “middle England’s” favouite department store, but she is taking over at a tricky time: profits slumped 31% to £32m in the first half of this year as the chain struggled to adapt to the shift to online shopping. Bali Padda The Indian-born Briton is the first non-Dane to lead Lego, which has survived in the computer game era by expanding into film franchise merchandise such as Star Wars and Harry Potter. Prices in the UK will be going up 5% at the start of the year as a result of the Brexit-induced fluctuations in the pound. Padda joined in 2004 and has been promoted from chief operations officer. Ross McEwan The New Zealander who runs Royal Bank of Scotland will be hoping to reach a settlement with the Department of Justice over a bond mis-selling scandal and find a buyer for 300 branches that must be sold under state aid penalties imposed by Brussels. Until these are resolved, the Treasury will struggle to sell off its 73% stake in the bank. In February, RBS will announce its ninth consecutive year of losses – which have already topped £50bn since its bailout. Sean Clarke Already six months into his role running Asda, the UK arm of US retail giant Walmart, Clarke has inherited a business that has dropped into third place out of four big UK supermarkets. A Briton who has had a global career, Clarke will need to use all the expertise of the Walmart empire to fight back against the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda’s selling point has been price. Clarke will need to find another reason to get shoppers through the door. Sharon White The head of media regulator Ofcom could be asked to examine the offer by 21st Century Fox to buy Sky and keep BT honest as it separates its Openreach unit, which controls the UK’s broadband infrastructure. Her profile is already rising: mobile operator Three is projecting an image of her as a cartoon superhero on to landmark buildings to encourage her to put a 30% cap on the amount of mobile spectrum that any operator can run. Keith Hellawell The clock is ticking on the former police officer’s tenure as chairman of Sports Direct. In September, 53% of the embattled retailer’s independent shareholders voted against his re-election to the role. In January, another vote will be called. He is likely to survive it – as this time 55% shareholder Mike Ashley gets a say – but he has pledged to stand down if the majority of independent shareholders vote against him at the next AGM. Andy Parker The boss of Capita ended 2016 on a sour note after the outsourcing company issued two profit warnings in three months. The blame is being placed on Brexit and problems with IT for London’s congestion charging zone. The shares dived to 10-year lows, putting pressure on Parker, who has been running the outsourcing company since 2014 and will want to avoid taking the axe to the dividend. Marco Gobbetti The chief executive designate of Burberry will not take the helm until the middle of the year – 12 months after his appointment was announced in a move that marked the end of Christopher Bailey’s unusual dual role as creative director and chief executive. Gobbetti won plaudits while running the French luxury brand Celine, and Bailey, who will become president and focus on his role as creative director, welcomed him with a promise of a “wonderfully collaborative relationship”. 2017 will be the test of that. Jamie Dimon As chief executive of America’s biggest bank, JP Morgan, Dimon’s words and actions will be of particular interest in the UK in 2017. In the run-up to the 23 June referendum, Dimon had warned that 4,000 jobs were at risk if there was a vote for Brexit. The bank employs 19,000 people across the UK in Canary Wharf, Bournemouth and Glasgow and any move by JP Morgan to start shifting jobs could set the tone for other banks. Alex Cruz Six months into taking control of British Airways in a management reshuffle, Cruz ended 2016 having staved off strike action by baggage handlers, check-in staff and cabin crew. The new year brings new challenges: he has already outlined plans to squeeze more passengers on to planes from 2018 and from 11 January will start charging economy customers on short-haul and domestic flights from Heathrow and Gatwick for M&amp;S food."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/dec/01/nuclear-power-keeps-the-corporates-in-charge-no-wonder-its-conservatives-preferred-solution-to-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-01T23:51:19Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power keeps the corporates in charge.

No wonder it's conservatives' preferred solution to climate change","bodyText":"“I have no theological objection” to nuclear power, Tony Abbott said on 1 December, responding to Julie Bishop’s relaunch of the right’s preferred “solution” to global warming this week. Abbott’s choice of words is fascinating. On the face of it he’s suggesting that opposing nuclear power is a faith-based, rather than rational, view. But it is the right’s consistent promotion of a technology that has been shown repeatedly to be too slow, too costly and too risky (see, for instance, here and here) that is underpinned by several right wing articles of faith. It’s worth unpacking this credo, because it reveals what’s really going on when nuclear power is raised. The first tenet is a truly theological one, based on a one-eyed reading of the Bible: “And God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” The US Christian right has long promoted this line from Genesis 1:28 as a Biblical critique of environmentalism. God is telling them, they believe, that we humans are entitled to do whatever we like with the Earth and its resources. There is, of course, a very different Biblical view. Thea Ormerod of the Australian religious response to climate change, among others, talks of the concept of “stewardship”, and the responsibility to look after God’s creation. But the “dominion mandate” dovetails so neatly with the modern industrial idea that humanity is separate from and dominant over nature that it has become a powerful aspect of the western materialist creation story. Nuclear power fits perfectly within a world view that sees splitting the atom as the apogee of human dominance over nature. Given its enormous and persistent waste problem, nuclear power is only acceptable if you believe that it is our right to pollute as we please. Abbott has explicitly referred to the dominion mandate, most notably in a speech about forestry early this year. Clearly, this theology influences his views on nuclear power. The second tenet is not canonical, unless you believe Jesus was making an ironic statement when he threw the money-lenders out of the temple. But the increasingly blind faith Abbott and his ilk invest in corporate capitalism has developed a distinctly theological aura. While it is reasonable to reject climate science, and acceptable to deny declining reef health, it is heresy to question whether handing ever more power to corporate interests will benefit the rest of us. The privatisation of profit and socialisation of risk inherent in nuclear power only makes economic sense if you believe in the divine right of corporations. With multi-billion dollar cost blowouts in construction and decommissioning, the refusal of private insurance companies to cover risk, and a waste stream that will need to be managed for many times longer than our civilisation has so far existed, it’s basically a complex wealth transfer from citizens to corporations. Nuclear power’s great attraction for those who subscribe to this particular faith is that it would maintain the corporate grip on energy infrastructure at a time when diversified and distributed renewable energy systems threaten to democratise energy supply. Energy regulators the world over are facing increasingly panicked demands from beleaguered fossil fuel companies to staunch the loss of market share as more and more people realise that solar power makes sense. In parts of the USA, there are even proposals to make going off the grid illegal. In this context, nuclear power is a godsend. The final tenet is the central one of conservative faith - that change is difficult, dangerous and unnecessary. This, as Naomi Klein’s latest book, This Changes Everything, points out is what makes climate change so threatening for the right. The clear message of accelerating global warming caused by the fuels that have allowed industrial consumerist capitalism to develop is that we have to change direction. If you want to deal with climate change – but your world view won’t let you contemplate changing the way we use energy, the way we consume, the way our society is structured – nuclear power provides a neat solution. It suggests that we can tackle climate change without really changing anything. A pity it’s not true. Not even the International Energy Agency believes it. But then neither, frankly, do many of its advocates. Spruiking nuclear power, for many on the right, is not about actually promoting its use. It’s far more important as a weapon in the culture war, promoting an idea which buttresses their three key articles of faith: that “man” has dominion over nature; that corporate might makes right; and that change must be avoided. Opposition to nuclear power is, I would emphasise, a rational position. The evidence is stacked against it. A suite of renewable energy options can be rolled out faster and cheaper and more safely, and they can supply our energy needs - so long as we also change our profligate lifestyles. But it is also an ethical position, based on a particular world-view; a view that we humans need to stop living as if there is no tomorrow, or there will be no tomorrow; a view that we can and should live as though all of us on this planet, human and non-human, now and in the future, matter. Support for nuclear power is based on a world-view, but it doesn’t have the benefit of also being backed by rational arguments. It is simply a fantasy of the right, a convenient prop they occasionally produce to pretend we can address climate change while changing nothing, and a weapon in their culture war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-doing-business-with-china-not-a-question-of-whether-but-when-and-how","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T18:42:17Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on doing business with China: not a question of whether, but when and how | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-doing-business-with-china-not-a-question-of-whether-but-when-and-how","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-doing-business-with-china-not-a-question-of-whether-but-when-and-how","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on doing business with China: not a question of whether, but when and how","bodyText":"It has been a bad couple of weeks for China Inc, with useful international deals coming off the rails and damaging its brand in the process. First, its invitation to the Hinkley Point party was snatched back as Theresa May put plans for the nuclear plant on ice. Her concerns about the security implications of Chinese investment, particularly in critical infrastructure, soon became apparent. Then, on Thursday, came Australia’s announcement that it would block a Chinese state-owned company from leasing a Sydney electricity grid on national security grounds. Add in the US justice department’s indictment of the state-owned firm investing in Hinkley Point over nuclear espionage – an adviser to China General Nuclear Power is due in court next week, though he denies the charges. The case does not bear directly on the UK plans for a marriage of French technology and Chinese investment, to the commercial advantage of CGN. But it adds to the miasma of suspicion surrounding the behaviour and intentions of the Chinese state and Chinese businesses. That may make a decision to axe the Somerset project look more politically attractive, as No 10 perhaps hopes. It would be the wisest course given doubts about the technology and the immense cost to the UK taxpayer. Anxiety about the implications of Chinese investment and concerns over industrial espionage are not new, though Australia and especially the US are voicing them increasingly loudly, and providing evidence to back up allegations. A commentary issued by China’s state news agency warned on Thursday of the dangers of “China-phobia”, and in truth, a strain of lurking Yellow Perilism can sometimes be discerned indiscussions, as if business activity was not being conducted to make money, but as a front for some more sinister purpose. Acknowledging such prejudices does not mean ignoring the fact that China and western countries have different values and beliefs about the rules by which companies and countries play. China’s conception of national security extends far into industrial and even cultural realms. The line between state and commercial actors and interests is blurred; no company can defy authorities on a significant issue. And foreign businesses in China complain of an increasingly hostile atmosphere. It is only right and sensible to seek engagement with the world’s second largest economy, and its cooperation and investment brings considerable benefits – especially evident in light of the vote to leave the EU. It is also sensible to scrutinise and manage foreign investments carefully, as experts such as Nigel Inkster, formerly of MI6, advocate, acknowledging the challenges they pose not only in infrastructure but also in areas such as the tech sector, which may provide the future innovation that will drive the UK economy. Some deals may not be appropriate; others may need to be structured and monitored carefully. The question is not whether to do business with China, but when and how to do it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2016/dec/07/my-hunting-trip-with-yeltsin-killed-off-the-soviet-union","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-07T15:18:27Z","webTitle":"My hunting trip with Yeltsin killed off the Soviet Union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/my-hunting-trip-with-yeltsin-killed-off-the-soviet-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/dec/07/my-hunting-trip-with-yeltsin-killed-off-the-soviet-union","fields":{"headline":"My hunting trip with Yeltsin killed off the Soviet Union","bodyText":"The man whose signature in effect dissolved the Soviet Union 25 years ago on Thursday has admitted that was not his intention as he travelled to the fateful meeting. The Belavezha Accords, which were signed in Belarus on 8 December 1991, broke up the Soviet Union and launched its constituent republics on the path to statehood. But Stanislav Shushkevich, then chairman of the Belarus supreme soviet, had no plans “to bring up the question about what the Soviet Union is and how it should exist” as he went to meet Russia’s Boris Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine at a state resort in the Belavezha forest, he told the Guardian. He had invited Yeltsin to a hunting trip there to try to secure Russian oil and gas supplies for Belarus during the impending winter. In the end, both the hunting and the energy talks gave way to more serious matters. As the delegations gathered, they realised the political crisis would have to be solved first. After the August 1991 hardliner coup against Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempts at reform, the Soviet Union had become “essentially ungoverned”, Shushkevich said. The agreement they signed started the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose alliance of 11 of 15 former Soviet republics. But its greatest achievement was dissolving the USSR after 70 years without large-scale violence, Shushkevich said. Western leaders had feared that a Soviet breakup would lead to civil war in the nuclear power. “The important result of the appearance of the CIS was that the divorce [from the Soviet Union] happened without scandal or a drop of blood,” Shushkevich said. “Countries made declarations of independence and started considering themselves independent.” The legacy of the agreement and its intention to “build democratic, rule-of-law states” in the former Soviet Union remains mixed. After heady democracy and huge economic inequality in the 1990s, Russia under Vladimir Putin has experienced a rise in living standards but a drop in pluralism. Georgia attempted to turn towards the west and make reforms, but a 2008 war with Russia cemented Moscow’s control over the Georgian breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Ukraine’s own turn towards to the west led to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, while the rest of the country remains mired in corruption. In Uzbekistan on Sunday, the late ruler Islam Karimov’s right-hand man, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, won 88.6% of the vote in a presidential election that monitors said was “devoid of genuine competition”. Moldova recently elected a reactionary pro-Russia president. Shushkevich blamed the resurgence of Soviet-style political trends on Russia spreading “imperial thinking” that “positions Russia as a big brother”. While he insisted he wouldn’t have done anything differently at Belavezha, he did admit some regrets over what had happened since. “I’m disappointed because the Belavezha Accords opened big opportunities, but Putin wants to turn this around,” Shushkevich said. “He said the breakup of the Soviet Union was a tragedy, but this is an unacceptable statement, because tens of millions died for this communist order. We need to make a government for the people, not sacrifice the people for the state.” During the discussions at Belavezha, the seed for a wide-ranging agreement was planted when the then Russian secretary of state, Gennady Burbulis, unexpectedly asked whether the others would be willing to sign a statement that “the USSR as a geopolitical reality and subject of international law ends its existence”. Shushkevich jumped on the idea, and the group began hashing out the accords. To avoid the appearance they were “creating a Union of Slavic Republics”, Shushkevich called Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev to invite him to sign. He promised to come but was held up by “technical reasons” in Moscow; later it emerged that Gorbachev had offered him the position of chairman of the supreme Soviet in the renewed USSR. Shushkevich denied rumours that the group went drinking that night in the banya, a kind of Slavic steam bath, saying they had only enjoyed a long steam and massage. “Yes, it was customary to drink at meetings in the Soviet Union, ‘democratic centralism’ [where binding decisions are made centrally] was also customary, but there was no drunkenness or democratic centralism” at Belavezha, he joked. Although hunting was only the pretext to gather the leaders together, Kravchuk and the then Ukrainian prime minister, Vitold Fokin, went out the next morning and Fokin shot a wild boar, Shushkevich recalled. That morning they reconvened and worked out the rest of the agreement. After signing it, Shushkevich called Gorbachev while Yeltsin called the then US president, George HW Bush. Shushkevich said Gorbachev hung up on him when he heard Bush had been told about the accords. Shushkevich became the leader of an independent Belarus, but was defeated by Alexander Lukashenko in the 1994 presidential election. Since then, Lukashenko has resisted many reforms and locked up prominent critics, and the state still controls four-fifths of the economy. The former leader said he was hopeful change would come with the younger generation, which unlike its predecessors has unfettered access to information. “I’m disappointed that we can’t strengthen democratic principles in Belarus, but we just need to live through this phase,” Shushkevich said. “After revolutions in the west, blood was spilled for a long time, and they fought for the rights they have now, an open society with human rights.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/jul/21/were-not-giving-up-our-nukes-north-korea-rejects-iran-style-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-21T06:24:04Z","webTitle":"'We're not giving up our nukes': North Korea rejects Iran-style talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/were-not-giving-up-our-nukes-north-korea-rejects-iran-style-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jul/21/were-not-giving-up-our-nukes-north-korea-rejects-iran-style-talks","fields":{"headline":"'We're not giving up our nukes': North Korea rejects Iran-style talks","bodyText":"North Korea is not interested in an Iran-like dialogue with the United States to give up its nuclear capabilities, its foreign ministry has said, calling the programme an “essential deterrence” against the US. “It is not logical to compare our situation with the Iranian nuclear agreement because we are always subjected to provocative US military hostilities, including massive joint military exercises and a grave nuclear threat,” said a statement carried by official media. “We do not have any interest at all on dialogue for unilaterally freezing or giving up our nukes. “We are clearly a nuclear power and nuclear powers have their own interests.” The United States and five world powers have struck a historic deal with Iran that will limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanctions relief. The Iran agreement was a great political victory for Barack Obama, who has long promised to reach out to historic enemies, including North Korea. The deal, in return for lifting US, EU and UN sanctions that have crippled its economy, stipulates that Iran must accept long-term limits on its nuclear programme.

It sounds like a Hollywood plotline, but Barack Obama has urged world leaders at a summit in Washington to think about how they would respond if it played out in reality. David Cameron was among more than 50 delegates to the nuclear security summit who were shown film footage setting out the chilling storyline, including mock-up news reports, and asked to think through the consequences in a “scenario-planning” session. Speaking beforehand, the prime minister said the threat of nuclear material falling into the hands of a terrorist group such as Isis was “only too real”. “So many summits are about dealing with things that have already gone wrong and we are trying to put right. This is a summit about something we are trying to prevent,” he said. “The issue of nuclear security and the security of nuclear materials, particularly when it comes to the problems of international terrorism, the concept of terrorists and nuclear materials coming together – which is obviously a very chilling prospect. And something, in the light of the Belgian attacks, we know is a threat that is only too real. “That’s the point of being here and that action Britain has taken with America, very much giving a lead on nuclear security, and the security of nuclear sites, transport and materials. It is a very worthy and important topic, and we’re adding in quite a bit on cybersecurity, particularly of nuclear installations.” The scenario devised by the White House involved insiders at a medical facility conspiring to steal radioactive isotopes and smuggle them out, before making them available for sale on the “dark web”, the secretive part of the internet often used for illicit trading. The leaders were then asked to imagine that foreign fighters had purchased the material, and were plotting to use airborne drones to drop a radioactive dirty bomb on civilians. A UK official said: “We have already seen Daesh [Isis] trying to look at ... can they get their hands on low-level crop-using-type drones.” Sources said Britain’s response as news of the dangerous shipment emerged would include calling a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee of ministers and officials chaired by the prime minister; alerting the Border Force; and ensuring that intelligence agencies and the police collaborated in tackling the threat. World leaders have become increasingly concerned in recent years that highly dangerous nuclear material, whether the by-products of nuclear power generation or the radioactive isotopes used in medicine, could fall into the wrong hands. Obama hopes that beefing up nuclear security will be one of the key foreign policy legacies of his presidency. This week’s summit in Washington was the fourth he has held on the subject, and as the result of the discussions over the course of his presidency, countries have signed up to a series of measures, including storing volatile material such as highly enriched uranium more safely, and improving their responses to potential threats. Thirteen countries have declared themselves free of potentially dangerous nuclear material altogether. As well as participating in the scenario-planning session on Friday, Britain pledged in Washington to cooperate with other countries, including Turkey and Japan, on sharing best practice to protect nuclear infrastructure, including against cyber-attacks. The US and UK also said they would cooperate on a wargame later this year to assess the resilience of nuclear power stations to such an attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/jul/13/pound-rises-mccafferty-qe-credit-conditions-uk-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T14:31:34Z","webTitle":"Britain warned to expect 'nasty fiscal surprises' after failing stress test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jul/13/pound-rises-mccafferty-qe-credit-conditions-uk-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/jul/13/pound-rises-mccafferty-qe-credit-conditions-uk-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Britain warned to expect 'nasty fiscal surprises' after failing stress test – as it happened","bodyText":"Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says today’s OBR report shows the shortcomings in government policy since 2010: He writes: It was one of George Osborne’s most effective soundbites. Before, during and after the 2010 general election, the man who served as David Cameron’s chancellor for six years blamed his austerity measures on Labour’s failure to “fix the roof while the sun was shining”. What goes around comes around. The Office for Budget Responsibility was set up by Osborne in 2010 to keep tabs on the state of the public finances free from the clutches of politicians and has now published its first report into the long-term fiscal risks facing Britain. Its message was brutally simple. The UK has had a recession once in every decade since the 1970s and there is a 50% chance of there being another one in the next five years. Recessions play havoc with the public finances: three of those since the 1970s have seen the budget deficit – the difference between what the government spends and its income in any one year – rise to 6% or more..... Here’s Larry’s full analysis: If you missed this morning’s report on the UK credit market, then catch up here: Here’s our news story on the OBR’s fiscal warnings, for anyone just tuning in: UK public finances face twin threat from Brexit and downturn, says OBR Britain’s public finances are in worse shape to withstand a recession than they were on the eve of the financial crash a decade ago and face the twin threat of a fresh downturn and Brexit, the Treasury’s independent forecaster has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility – the UK’s fiscal watchdog – said another recession was inevitable at some point and that Theresa May’s failure to win a parliamentary majority in last month’s election had left the public finances more vulnerable to being blown off course than they were in 2007. In its first in-depth analysis of the fiscal risks facing Britain, the OBR said its main message was clear: “Governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time – because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them – and plan accordingly. “And they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks.” The OBR said the size of the UK’s Brexit divorce bill – currently a matter of dispute between London and Brussels – would have little impact on the public finances. But it noted that even a small fall in Britain’s underlying growth rate after departure from the EU would lead to a big increase in the country’s debt burden. “If GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher,” the OBR said. The OBR noted that Brexit was not the only threat to the government’s aim of eliminating the UK’s budget deficit. It said a hung parliament and “austerity fatigue”, alongside longer-term developments such as a rapidly ageing population, were also factors putting upward pressure on the deficit... More here: In other news.... the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has fallen, for the first time in a month. The initial jobless claims fell to 247,000 last week, from 250,000. That suggests the US labo(u)r market is still pretty robust. You can read the full OBR report yourself, here. Britain’s economy has failed a fiscal ‘stress test’ created to see how it would cope with a new financial crisis. The test, published in the OBR’s fiscal report today, models the impact of a deep recession, a tumbling stock market and a sterling crisis, which creates “lasting effects on potential output”. And the bad news is that Britain would suffer ‘severe’ fiscal effects: The deficit would rise to 8.1% of GDP by 2021-22 (of which 7.4% would be structural, and couldn’t simply be grown away) The national debt would rise to 114% of GDP (compared to 85% today) The deficit would be £66.2bn higher in 2017-18, rising to £158.5 billion higher by 2021-22 And to sum up: The Government’s fiscal targets would be missed by wide margins. This chart shows the full damage, and explains why the OBR fears Britain is in a vulnerable position when the next crisis strikes. Labour’s shadow chancellor has also responded: The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has described the OBR’s report as: “a stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country’s debts”. The broad message from the Office for Budget Responsibility is that Britain’s public finances are in a troubling state, vulnerable to nasty surprises, and with a shedload of troubles looming on the horizons. And Brexit could make this whole situation worse, as slower growth over the long term could drive the debt/GDP ratio into the danger zone, over 100%. Today’s report reaches three main conclusions: 1) The government must keep “endogenous risks under review”. That means risks created or influenceable by government policy - everything from the pension triple-lock to the cost of cleaning up Britain’s nuclear power stations. The problem, I suspect, is that there may not be many votes in dealing with certain risks.... 2) Britain must prepare for shocks. There may not be a recession this year. Or in 2018. But there will be one eventually, so future budgets need to create some fiscal space to react. According to the OBR, Britain will suffer at least one financial crisis and several recessions over the next 50 years. And even if the government avoids a classic economic downturn, the economy could be hurt by a natural disaster, a terror attack or a war. 3) Ministers must deal with many sources of slow-building pressure. Britain has a nasty habit of putting off difficult decisions or unpleasant problems (for example, social care for the elderly). But problems don’t go away if you ignore them. They just build up. This chart shows how the ratio between retirees and workers will rise steadily over the next few decades. More old people will need support, and the pool of taxpayers won’t grow fast enough to keep pace. Political and financial journalists and commentators are trawling through today’s Fiscal Risks report, and tweeting the key points and hidden gems. Here are some of the best so far: Today’s Fiscal Risks report includes this chart, showing the key threats to Britain’s public finances: The cost of supporting Britain’s ageing population is the biggest single pressure on public spending, says the OBR. Today’s report states: Pressures on public spending abound. By far the biggest relate to health, where an ageing population is raising demand while technological advances raise costs. Ageing also creates pressures on adult social care and the state pension – which each face policy-driven cost pressures in the form of the National Living Wage and the triple lock respectively. But there are many other pressure too. The OBR suggests: The uncertain costs of cleaning up nuclear power stations, compensating victims of clinical negligence and reimbursing tax that the courts determine should not have been collected. In the near term the Government may also need to finance an extensive programme of fire safety measures in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. All these have to be considered in the context of medium-term spending plans that imply significant real terms cuts in spending per person over the next three years, on top of those implemented since 2010. And on the increasingly unpopular 1% public sector pay cap... the OBR cautions that the money would have to come from somewhere.... Lifting current limits on public sector pay increases would pose a fiscal challenge to the extent that departments had their budgets increased to pay for it, rather than simply giving them greater flexibility over how they manage their pay bills. The Office For Budget Responsibility is also critical of the state of the UK public finances. The independent watchdog warns that Britain is “much more sensitive to interest rate and inflation surprises” than in the past -- hardly a ringing endorsement of the government’s handling of the economy. It says: We produce this report at a sensitive time. A decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis and recession, net borrowing is well down from its peak. But the budget is still in deficit by 2 to 3 per cent of GDP – as it was on the eve of the crisis – and net debt is more than double its pre-crisis share of GDP and not yet falling. As a result, the public finances are much more sensitive to interest rate and inflation surprises than they were. The OBR also highlights the recent turmoil in Westminster: In terms of the political backdrop, the previous Government had to abandon a number of measures to increase taxes and cut welfare spending, the new Government has just agreed a ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement that increases public spending significantly in Northern Ireland and the Chancellor of the Exchequer notes of austerity that “people are weary of the long slog”. The OBR also identifies ‘austerity fatigue’ as a threat to the government’s control of the fiscal purse strings. The OBR makes a very important point about Brexit. The long-term impact of leaving the EU will have a bigger impact on Britain’s long-term fiscal heath than the upfront cost of exiting the EU. And a small hit to growth over the long term would drive Britain’s national debt dramatically higher. In today’s report, the watchdog says: The new Government must also manage the risks posed by Brexit. These do not supplant the possible shocks and likely pressures that we have already discussed, but they could affect the likelihood and impact of many of them. A lot of attention focuses on the possible ‘divorce bill’, but, while some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU and other trading partners for the long-term growth of the UK economy, which we do not attempt to predict here. If GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher. Britain’s debt-to-GDP ratio is currently 85%, so you can see how significant slower growth would be over half a century.... The chance of a recession in any five-year period is around one in two, says the OBR. And financial crises come along too often for comfort too. The OBR says: The chance of a financial crisis in any five-year period is around one in four, but thankfully not all are as big or as costly as the most recent one. Breaking: The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s fiscal watchdog, has just published its latest Fiscal Risk report. It urges the UK government to prepare for ‘unexpected’ surprises (and not the nice sort, either), given its “vulnerable fiscal position and a challenging political environment”. The report points out that Britain’s budget is still in deficit by 2 to 3 per cent of GDP – as it was on the eve of the crisis – and net debt is more than double its pre-crisis share of GDP and not yet falling. The OBR says that Westminster should remember that recessions and financial crises are “almost inevitable over a 50-year horizon”, and plan accordingly. The main message is clear: governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time – because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them – and plan accordingly. And they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks. And for that reason, the OBR says, the Treasury should be cautious of signing off unfunded spending commitments. But new unfunded ‘giveaways’ would take the Government further away from its medium-term fiscal objective and would only add to the longer-term challenges. In many recent fiscal events, giveaways today have been financed by the promise of takeaways tomorrow. The risk there, of course, is that tomorrow never comes. More to follow.... AstraZeneca is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index, with investors unnerved by a media report that chief executive Pascal Soriot has been offered a job by Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. AstraZeneca declined to comment, saying it never comments on market speculation. Its shares fell more than 5% in early trading and were later down 4.7% at £49.49. Financial news website Calcalist said Soriot would earn twice as much as his predecessor at Teva and receive a signing-on bonus of about $20m, although the financial terms were still being discussed. Teva has been without a permanent CEO since February when Erez Vigodman stepped down, and its finance chief Eyal Desheh resigned at the end of last month. Soriot has run Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker since 2012 and famously fought off a takeover approach from American rival Pfizer at £55 a share in 2014. He has focused on rebuilding the drug pipeline to replace lost revenues after a string of patent expiries on blockbuster medicines, by investing in areas such as immuno-oncology – drugs that harness the body’s immune system to fight cancer. The Bank of England’s credit survey has also found that demand for buy-to-let loans has fallen. That may show that recent tax changes, which make BTL less profitable, are hitting demand. Other mortgage lending remained solid, though. The BoE says: Lenders reported that demand for secured lending for house purchase was unchanged in Q2 (Chart 3 below). Within this, demand for prime lending increased and demand for buy-to-let lending decreased significantly. Lenders expected total demand for secured lending for house purchase to increase in Q3, driven by an increase in buy-to-let lending and a slight increase in prime lending. Demand for remortgaging was reported to have decreased slightly in Q2, but was expected to be unchanged in Q3. Back in April, the government began cutting back at the interest relief enjoyed by BTL landlords. Those changes will stop them deducting mortgage interest and other finance-related costs from their rental income before calculating their tax liability. Some landlords say their total tax bill will soar, making buy-to-let much less financially attractive.... Cambridge economics professor Victoria Bateman is concerned by the rise in credit card defaults: Economist Rupert Seggins shows why we should take the Bank’s survey seriously: In an alarming development, more people are defaulting on their credit card bills and other unsecured loans. The Bank of England’s survey of credit conditions has found that the default rates on both credit card and other unsecured lending to UK households have “increased significantly” in the second quarter of this year. Worryingly, defaults are “expected to increase further on credit card lending” in the third quarter. That’s a sign that UK households are struggling to meet their financial obligations, perhaps because inflation is now outstripping wage growth. As this chart shows, there was a sharp jump in the number of lenders reporting that default rates have risen. Newsflash: The availability of credit in the UK economy is likely to fall this summer. That’s according to the Bank of England’s latest credit conditions survey. It suggests that banks and other lenders are becoming more cautious about making new loans, reflecting caution over Britain’s economic prospects. The survey found that there will be less ‘secured credit’, such as a mortgage, on offer over the next quarter. This will particular affect people who only have a small deposit for their house. The Bank of England says: The availability of secured credit to households was reported to have increased in the three months to mid-June 2017 (Chart 1 below), driven by lenders’ market share objectives. But lenders expect availability to fall slightly over the next three months to mid-September, reflecting a changing appetite for risk. Lenders expect that slight reduction in availability to affect only borrowers with loan to value (LTV) ratios of more than 75%, and in particular those with a LTV ratio of more than 90%. Lenders also told the BoE that the availability of unsecured credit (such as credit cards) dropped in the last three months. It will probably continue to decline as lending criteria are tightened up.... Lenders reported that the availability of unsecured credit to households had decreased in Q2 (Chart 2), and expected a further decrease in Q3. A changing appetite for risk was reported to be an important driver of this in Q2 and Q3, with a changing economic outlook also affecting expectations for Q3. Credit scoring criteria for granting both credit card and other unsecured loans were reported to have tightened again in Q2, with lenders expecting further tightening in Q3. Troubled construction group Carillion is having another bad day. Shares have hit fresh record lows this morning, as the shock profit warning issued on Monday continues to alarm investors. They fell as low as 51p, down another 10% today. That meant Carillion has lost almost three quarters (!) of its value this week, since shocking shareholders by taking a monster£845m provision against contract losses. Analysts believe Carillion needs to raise £500m in fresh capital to avoid collapse - or more than double its current value. My colleague Simon Goodley explains what went terribly badly wrong: For many, the morning of 8 July promised a feast of sport: the British Lions Test in New Zealand, a Lord’s Test and Wimbledon. But a small group of bankers were about to have their weekend ruined by a summons to an emergency meeting in London’s Maddox Street. Board papers had been delivered to the homes of the directors of Carillion, a FTSE 250 business best known as a builder that works on huge construction projects, and the documents contained disturbing news. A review of the group’s finances, commissioned two months earlier from accountants KPMG, had unearthed a gaping hole in the accounts. Meetings through Saturday and Sunday produced an 800-word statement to the stock exchange, which shocked the City when it was released at 7am on Monday morning. It was a monster profit warning following an £845m writedown, of which £375m related to three large public private partnership (PPP) contracts in the UK and £470m to the cost of pulling out of several markets in the Middle East and Canada.... Over in the City, shares in home shopping group N Brown have slumped by 8% in early trading. The company has just admitted that it sold flawed insurance products for many years, and faces a £40m bill to put it right. The pound is also rallying against the euro, up 0.4% at €1.133. That takes sterling away from the eight-month low of €1.119 struck yesterday. The pound has jumped after Ian McCafferty’s comments about possibly unwinding QE early hit the wires. Sterling has gained more than half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.295. That adds to yesterday’s gains, when the US dollar fell generally following Janet Yellen’s testimony. A Bank of England policymaker has spiced up the growing debate over UK monetary policy, by calling for an early end to its huge quantitative easing programme. Ian McCafferty, who is one of the most hawkish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, argued that the BoE should rethink its current policy of not unwinding QE until interest rates have risen close to more normal levels. Speaking to The Times, McCafferty point out that the Federal Reserve is already outlining plans to normalise its balance sheet: Given that other central banks are thinking about it, I think it would be remiss of us not to at least think about it. The Bank of England currently holds £435bn of debt (mostly government bonds), bought with newly created money during the financial crisis. QE drove up asset prices, pushed down Britain’s borrowing costs, and (apparently) stimulated the economy. Unwinding the programme is going to be tricky, and could easily drive up the long-term cost of borrowing - crucially important to banks, mortgage-payers and governments alike. The Bank of England has previously explained that QE wouldn’t be touched until interest rates had returned to 2% (they’re just 0.25% today). McCafferty also dropped a loud hint that he is planning to vote for an interest rate hike in August - as he did in June. He said: As of today, I would not be changing my position. This means that August’s crunch meeting is likely to see a big split at the Bank; Michael Saunders is also expected to vote to hike borrowing costs, and there’s speculation that chief economist Andy Haldane could join the hawks too. McCafferty argued that the UK economy could handle higher interest rates, pointing out that the jobless rate has hit a 42-year low. He also warned that inflation is likely to “peak at over 3 percent” - well over the BoE’s 2% target. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets are pushing higher today as investors digest yesterday’s testimony from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen to Congress. Asian stock markets have hit a two-year high, following gains on Wall Street, after Yellen was more dovish than expected. The Fed chair signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise gradually, and singled out weak inflation as a key factor. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: Equity markets jumped sharply yesterday with the Dow hitting a new record high, while the US dollar slumped after Fed chief Janet Yellen caught investors by surprise by leaning back from the prospect of multiple rate hikes in the coming months. Market reaction was also reinforced by her comments that inflation was running below target and that rates wouldn’t need to rise much further to get back to neutral. This comment in particular suggests that the Fed believes that a lot of the heavy lifting on rates may well have been done in the short term, which may help explain why we saw long term yields slip back down to a one week low, and certainly takes a September rate rise off the table. European markets romped ahead during Yellen’s testimony, and are expected to hold onto those gains this morning But the mood could change at 9.30am, when the latest UK consumer credit figures are released. They will show whether Britons have been hitting their credit cards, to cope with the fact wages aren’t keeping up with prices. The data could also show whether lenders have been more cautious about extending credit. RBC Capital Markets say: Last time the survey indicated that lenders were anticipating tightening conditions on unsecured household lending so this edition will reveal whether or not that intention came to fruition. We also get the latest US weekly jobs report, while Janet Yellen will head back to Capitol Hill for a second day of testimony. Here’s the agenda: 9.30am: Bank of England credit conditions survey 1.30pm: US weekly initial jobless claims figures 3pm: Janet Yellen testifies to the Senate banking committee"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/30/has-chernobyl-disaster-affected-number-of-nuclear-plants-built","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-30T08:00:20Z","webTitle":"Has the Chernobyl disaster affected the number of nuclear plants built?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/has-chernobyl-disaster-affected-number-of-nuclear-plants-built","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/30/has-chernobyl-disaster-affected-number-of-nuclear-plants-built","fields":{"headline":"Has the Chernobyl disaster affected the number of nuclear plants built?","bodyText":"This week marks 30 years since an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine led to a huge leak of radiation across eastern Europe.

The data demonstrates its impact: in the 32 years before Chernobyl, 409 reactors were opened, but only 194 have been connected in the three decades since. There were other factors in play, too. Yes, some of the change was directly down to the disaster in Ukraine. Italy, for example, voted in a referendum soon afterwards to stop producing nuclear energy. However, consultant nuclear engineer John Large says that regulations and transparency demands introduced in the wake of a 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania actually had a bigger impact. “Fukushima will have the same effect,” he says. The disaster in Japan prompted the German government to phase out its plants, with the last one closing in 2022. “Nuclear energy is failing because it is simply too expensive,” says Dr Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the Energy Institute, University College London. “If there’s another nuclear accident in the next five or 10 years, you can say goodbye to the industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/29/former-tepco-bosses-charged-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-29T07:52:14Z","webTitle":"Former Tepco bosses  charged Fukushima meltdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/former-tepco-bosses-charged-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/29/former-tepco-bosses-charged-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Former Tepco bosses  charged over Fukushima meltdown","bodyText":"Three former executives from Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) have been charged with contributing to deaths and injuries stemming from the triple meltdown in 2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Their indictment on Monday marks the start of the first criminal action to be taken in connection with the disaster, which forced the evacuation of 160,000 residents, many of whom are still unable to return to their homes. Tsunehisa Katsumata, who was Tepco’s chairman at the time, has been charged with professional negligence resulting in death, along with two former vice-presidents, Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro. The men, who have not been taken into custody, allegedly failed to take measures to defend Fukushima Daiichi, despite being aware of the risk from a tsunami. Three of the plant’s six reactors went into meltdown after a magnitude-9 earthquake triggered a tsunami along the north-east coast of Japan on 11 March 2011. The waves flooded the facility’s back-up power supply and crippled the reactors’ cooling systems, causing massive radiation leaks. Experts say prosecutors could struggle to prove criminal responsibility for failing to prevent the meltdown. The trial, which is not expected to begin until next year, could reveal information about the disaster that Tepco has yet to make public. Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK, said the three former executives would plead not guilty to the charges and argue that it was impossible to predict the size of the tsunami. An independent judicial panel of citizens ruled last July that the men should go on trial, after public prosecutors had twice decided not to pursue the case. The 11-member panel, which has the power to compel prosecutors to act, said Katsumata, 75, Muto, 65, and Takekuro, 69, should be held criminally responsible for the deaths of 44 elderly hospital patients during and soon after the evacuation, and injuries to Tepco staff and members of the self-defence forces. Campaigners called the indictments “a major step”, and called on Japan to abandon nuclear power. “The people of Fukushima and Japan deserve justice,” said Hisayo Takada of Greenpeace Japan. “The court proceedings that will now follow should reveal the true extent of Tepco’s and the Japanese regulatory system’s enormous failure to protect the people of Japan. “Tepco and the Japanese regulator continue to ignore demands to disclose key details of what they know about the causes of the accident. The 100,000 people who still can’t return home deserve to have all the facts.” Of the country’s 43 working reactors, four have been restarted since last year, while the remainder are undergoing repairs and checks under stricter post-Fukushima safety regulations. Reports by the government and MPs have been strongly critical of the safety culture at Tepco, and of lax oversight by the government and regulators. Last year, the International Atomic Energy Agency pointed to a misguided faith in the safety of nuclear power as a key factor in the Fukushima accident. A 2012 parliamentary report said Fukushima was a “manmade disaster” caused by poor regulation and collusion between the government, Tepco and the industry’s watchdog. Tepco has insisted it was impossible to anticipate a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost five years ago. The judicial panel said, however, that the executives ignored a 2008 internal report predicting that the plant could be struck by tsunami as high as 15.7 metres, adding that they had “failed to take pre-emptive measures, knowing the risk of a major tsunami”. Only last week, the utility admitted it had failed to announce that meltdowns had occurred in three Fukushima Daiichi reactors until two months after the accident. Tepco said it had been unaware of a company emergency manual that defined a meltdown as damage to more than 5% of the fuel inside a reactor. For weeks, the firm said the reactors had sustained less serious “core damage”. The nuclear and industrial safety agency, the industry watchdog at the time, also refused to describe the accident as a meltdown. Tepco only started using the word meltdown May 2011, after a computer simulation showed fuel in one reactor had almost entirely melted and fallen to the bottom of the primary containment chamber, and that two other reactor cores had melted significantly. The firm conceded its initial wording had been misleading, but insisted it had responded appropriately. “Core damage or meltdown, it didn’t make any difference in how we responded to the emergency, which was to cool the cores no matter what,” said Tepco spokesman Shinichi Nakakuki."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/feb/21/vitaly-churkin-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-21T13:11:51Z","webTitle":"Vitaly Churkin obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/vitaly-churkin-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/feb/21/vitaly-churkin-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Vitaly Churkin obituary","bodyText":"Vitaly Churkin, who has died aged 64 after suffering a heart attack, was the longest serving Russian ambassador to the United Nations, a tenacious, committed and often witty defender of his country’s interests with a career that ranged from nuclear disarmament to the Balkan wars. He was appointed to the UN post in 2006 shortly before western governments stepped up their efforts to expand Nato into the highly sensitive arena of Ukraine and Georgia, souring the atmosphere of western co-operation with the Kremlin that had marked the early post-Soviet period under Boris Yeltsin and the first years of Vladimir Putin. Like Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who also served for 10 years in New York as Russia’s UN representative, Churkin epitomised the peak of professionalism in his country’s diplomatic service, mastering the detailed dossiers of every conflict and crisis around the world while explaining Russia’s stance with clarity, firmness and dignity. He hated the moralising tone of his US, British and French counterparts on the UN security council who, he felt, were not only hypocritical but were playing to the global gallery and aiming to score rhetorical points instead of looking for compromises that could lead to the resolution of differences. This applied particularly to the war in Syria, about which western governments tabled resolutions that could lead, in the Russian view, to full-scale military intervention against the Syrian government and which they knew Churkin was bound to veto. Russia preferred to produce resolutions that criticised the Syrian army for using “disproportionate” force and sought agreement on ceasefires. Churkin consulted the security council’s five permanent members on these resolutions, but chose not to provoke vetoes when he realised there was no consensus. Churkin’s rhetorical fire was directed especially at Samantha Power, his US counterpart, who had no previous diplomatic experience before she took up the post. He once accused her of making a “strange” speech as though she were Mother Teresa, a role that the US record of intervention in the Middle East did not justify. When she condemned Russian bombing in Aleppo, he responded by recalling US carpet-bombing of Vietnam. Two weeks before his death he went on the diplomatic attack when the British UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, called on Moscow to “return Crimea” to Ukraine. Churkin said: “Return the Malvinas, return Gibraltar. Then maybe your conscience might be clearer and you could discuss other topics.” Challenged over civilian casualties caused by Russian bombing in Aleppo by the former British diplomat Stephen O’Brien, who had become the UN’s relief co-ordinator, Churkin said: “If we wanted to hear a sermon, we would go to church. If we wanted to hear poetry, we would go to a theatre. Give us one fact, please, or leave this kind of storytelling for the novel you may well write later.” While often sharp with western representatives in the cockpit of the security council, Churkin also had enough confidence and Kremlin backing to criticise Russia’s allies in public. A few months after Russia started to use its air force in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad told an interviewer in February 2016 that he aimed to win back all of Syria from opposition forces. Churkin promptly responded in the Russian newspaper Kommersant with a politely worded but clear rebuke: “I heard President Assad’s remarks on television ... Of course they do not chime with the diplomatic efforts that Russia is undertaking … The discussions are about a ceasefire, a cessation of hostilities in the foreseeable future. Work is under way on this. Russia has invested very seriously in this crisis, politically, diplomatically, and now also in the military sense. So of course we would like Bashar al-Assad to take account of that.” Born in Moscow, Churkin showed considerable acting talent as a child. He starred as an 11-year-old in a film about Lenin and in two other films over the next three years. After he left school he attended the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations, the main training ground for prospective high flyers in the Soviet foreign service. On graduation in 1974 he spent the next five years negotiating with the Americans as a diplomat in the Soviet team at the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (Salt) talks, a post that required him to master a huge amount of technical detail on nuclear weapons. After three years in Moscow as a third secretary on the US desk in the foreign ministry, he was posted to Washington in 1982. There he made history in 1986 by becoming the first Soviet official to testify before a Congressional committee. The Soviet ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin, chose his junior colleague to parry questions on the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster because of his almost flawless English and his diplomatic charm – as well as his technical expertise. He returned to Moscow in 1987 shortly before Mikhail Gorbachev’s “revolution from above” became a “revolution from below”, with nationalist pressures developing in the Baltic states and the Caucasus, anti-communist street protests becoming an everyday affair in many Soviet cities, and economic problems mounting. Churkin worked in the international department of the Soviet Communist party’s central committee and in 1990 was appointed to lead the foreign ministry’s information department. Here he first began to shine as a user of dry wit in verbal combat with westerners, treating foreign journalists with nuanced explanations of the twists and turns of Gorbachev’s foreign policy. During the Bosnian war, with the Russian Federation emerging from the ruins of the Soviet Union, Churkin served as Moscow’s representative to the sputtering talks process from 1992 to 1994. He used Russia’s traditional links with the Orthodox Serbs to broker a deal that was to lift the Bosnian Serbs’ siege of Sarajevo and lead to Russian troops joining a UN peacekeeping force. When the Bosnian Serbs broke it by advancing on the Muslim-held safe haven of Goražde, Churkin accused them of exploiting “Russian support as a cover”. Between 1994 and 1998 he served as Russia’s liaison with Nato when the first moves – opposed by many former US and British ambassadors to Moscow – were made to expand Nato to the Russian border by bringing former Soviet allies, such as Poland and Hungary, into the US-led alliance. From 1998 he spent five years in Ottawa as Russian ambassador to Canada, followed by three years as a roving ambassador dealing with Arctic negotiations with Europe and the US. In 2006 he attained what is considered the top post in the Russian foreign ministry (apart from foreign minister), the highly stressful role of representing his country at the UN. He performed it with dignity and diligence until dying of a cardiac arrest at his desk. He had a history of heart problems and also suffered from leukaemia, which he did not reveal to his colleagues. After more than a decade at the UN, he joked that he was becoming the “permanent” Russian representative. He is survived by his wife, Irina, son, Maxim, and daughter, Anastasia. • Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin, diplomat, born 21 February 1952; died 20 February 2017"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/jun/12/alan-finkel-it-would-be-surprising-if-ministers-encouraged-new-coal-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-12T08:23:29Z","webTitle":"Alan Finkel: 'it would be surprising' if ministers encouraged new coal stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/12/alan-finkel-it-would-be-surprising-if-ministers-encouraged-new-coal-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/jun/12/alan-finkel-it-would-be-surprising-if-ministers-encouraged-new-coal-stations","fields":{"headline":"Alan Finkel: 'it would be surprising' if ministers encouraged new coal stations","bodyText":"The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, says he doesn’t know if Australia can meet its Paris commitments under the 28% emissions reduction target he has floated for electricity. He also says it would be “surprising” if governments ultimately implemented a new clean energy target which “incentivised” building new coal-fired power stations. The landmark Finkel review has faced criticism since it was unveiled last week for proposing a clean energy target where emissions from electricity would be cut by 28% on 2005 levels by 2030 – a target environment groups and some experts believe is too low for Australia to meet its Paris commitments. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Finkel said 28% was not a hard recommendation, it was a figure modelled by his review. “We didn’t recommend 28%, that’s just what we modelled. If governments want to do more once they’ve considered the whole of economy’s needs, so be it for them.” Asked whether Australia could met its Paris targets under a 28% target for electricity, Finkel said: “I genuinely don’t know.” The chief scientist also used the interview to signal it was unlikely a new coal station would be built in the system envisaged by his review. Asked whether he believed anyone would build one, Finkel said: “The answer is I don’t know. I can tell you under the [review’s] modelling, none came in. Under the modelling, none came in”. Finkel said there were absolutely no prohibitions under the proposed clean energy target for new coal stations in the national electricity market – but he said he would be surprised if any government actively sought them. “If [proponents] can get legal permits from governments to build a coal station, they can go out and do that, but it would be surprising if governments were to endorse a ... scheme that incentivised them,” he said. Finkel’s comments came as Coalition MPs prepared to meet in Canberra on Tuesday morning to consider his review of the national electricity market. The energy minister Josh Frydenberg was expected to outline the major elements of the Finkel review to government MPs now back in Canberra for the parliamentary sitting fortnight. Conservative government MPs, from the deputy prime minister down, have already signalled a viable future for coal is a key component for broad acceptance of the new scheme in government ranks. Internal opposition Ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, has been steadily upping the ante on the issue. On Monday he said the clean energy target sounded like a “magic pudding”, adding that the Coalition must not adopt a new tax on coal. The concerns about the Finkel blueprint in government ranks extend significantly further than Abbott, who used a fight over emissions trading in 2009 to take the Liberal party leadership from Malcolm Turnbull. Some Coalition MPs returning to Canberra for the last parliamentary sitting fortnight before the winter break are nervous that history could be about to repeat itself, with energy policy triggering another major split in government ranks. One MP told Guardian Australia on Monday Turnbull lost the fight over emissions trading in 2009 not only because of the internal opposition to carbon pricing, but because of how he handled the dissent. “The question is, has he learned the lesson?” The chairman of the Coalition’s backbench committee on climate change and energy, the conservative MP Craig Kelly, told Guardian Australia on Monday “there is real concern about what [the report] will do to energy prices, and to the competitiveness of our industries”. Kelly said the detail of the Finkel review was worse than he expected. The proposed clean energy target would “lock in high energy prices”, Kelly said, and the new system was “a de facto 42% renewable energy target”. Labor warned Turnbull on Monday to pull the dissenters into line. The party’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, said Turnbull was in danger of losing control of this process “before it even begins”. “Malcolm Turnbull has to stand up in his party room and stare down Tony Abbott and if he doesn’t, this process is not going to go very far,” Butler said. While government MPs were lining up in advance to declare that the Finkel report goes too far and will push up power prices, the chief scientist has faced a backlash from environment groups and some energy experts concerned about the review’s lack of ambition for emissions reduction. The chief scientist said the review modelled a 28% reduction in the absence of clear guidance from the Turnbull government about how Australia intended to meet its Paris obligations. “In the absence of that, we are recommending a mechanism but not the numbers,” Finkel said Monday. “We modelled what we felt was the only reasonable thing to model given those circumstances ... which was a smooth trajectory. “We are strongly of the opinion that one has to be planning and implementing a trajectory towards zero rather than fixed targets”. “So instead of thinking about 2030 as a fixed target then getting there and saying, ‘hey what next’ – we are looking at a trajectory towards zero emissions in the second half of the century that passes through a 28% target in 2030 off the 2005 baseline.” Finkel said it was not up to his review to make an arbitrary decision about whether electricity should do more of the heavy lifting than other sectors of the economy in meeting Australia’s Paris commitments. This would have been “jumping the gun”. He said: “People could argue that electricity should do more than its fair share, but we can’t make an arbitrary decision on that, that has to be done in the context of a whole of economy plan.” A plan for the whole economy The review had recommended the government determine an economy-wide plan for emissions reduction by 2020. Asked to explain why some previous modelling had indicated the electricity sector would need to reduce emissions by more than 60% to hit the Paris commitments, and that he had brought forward a 28% target, Finkel said some previous studies contained assumptions that he was not prepared to adopt. He said some previous analysis had assumed Australia’s energy mix by 2050 could include generation from geothermal, or nuclear power, or coal of gas with carbon capture and storage. The current review “made a decision in our modelling not to assume any of those. None of them can be assumed with confidence”. “We did not make assumptions that we would be rescued by technology ... that aren’t either politically or commercially, yet, viable. We set ourselves a much higher challenge. There is realism in our assumptions”. Asked whether Australia could meet its Paris emissions reduction target if the electricity target was legislated at 28%, Finkel said: “I’ve got more optimism that we can improve the efficiency of our transport system than I have optimism that we will ever get geothermal to work.” Asked whether this observation meant the government may need to pursue more ambitious emissions reductions proposals in transport, rather than energy, Finkel said: “They might. It’s important the government be given the opportunity to take a whole of economy approach in its thinking, and to see our blueprint for the future as a significant input to their planning.” Finkel made it clear that future governments could adjust the level of ambition in the clean energy target, and he said there was nothing to stop state governments pursuing their own state-based renewable schemes to supplement the national scheme. Cautious approach The chief scientist did warn that ratcheting up the ambition in the national scheme needed to be approached with caution. The review had not modelled cost and network security outcomes on a higher trajectory. “What I would recommend is whatever they do is well-considered and long-term. We certainly don’t want to go to a situation where the parameters keep changing in an uncertain fashion. It needs to be well-thought through”. On the future of the state-based schemes, Finkel said: “I think states have state rights that shouldn’t be questioned. I don’t question those state rights.” He said his core recommendation was for a national framework, but “if a state wanted to go beyond that, the reliability obligations [in the review] will help preserve reliability in their state.” “But you would expect the cost on consumers would be somewhat higher.” Finkel was asked about a campaign by the resources sector to set the baseline for the CET sufficiently high to allow high-efficiency coal to be eligible for certificates. He said his report modelled a scheme where the CET threshold was set at 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per megawatt hour. “I don’t have a strong view about where it should be set: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 would be the sorts of numbers that are reasonable”. Finkel seemed perplexed by a push to have the threshold set at 0.7 to favour coal. “It’s not going to be transformational, unless the threshold was set remarkably higher. “Your guess is as good as mine as to whether governments would ever set the threshold remarkably higher.” Finkel rejected Abbott’s characterisation of the CET as a “magic pudding” or a new tax on coal. The chief scientist said it was a mechanism to “incentivise new, cleaner, reliable generation into the market”. He said “uncertainty” over a decade had led to insufficient investment in thermal generation. “What we are recommending is a package of approaches that will provide the certainty and incentive to encourage new low emissions generation into the market.” While leaving the final decisions in the lap of the government, Finkel did warn Australia’s political parties not to waste the chance to develop a new consensus on climate policy. Asked whether he felt there was a danger of the perfect being made the enemy of the good, Finkel said: “Perfection is in the eye of the beholder. “If in pursuit of perfection our recommendations are not adopted by government, then the question is what do you go back to? “We’ve had 10 years of policy uncertainty and that has affected the system. The national electricity market has not developed in the way you would hope.” He said commentators had pointed out the response to the review was the government’s best shot for a decade in calling a truce in the climate wars. Finkel also warned if the review was rejected: “I’m not sure whether we’d be going back to business as usual. It could be worse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/jan/19/climate-change-affect-all-urgency-trump-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-19T13:17:11Z","webTitle":"Climate change will affect all of us.

So why the lack of urgency?","bodyText":"Tomorrow the world shudders as Donald Trump becomes US president. Hopes that wise advisers would mitigate the erratic, half-crazed stream of contradictions pouring from his lips have been dashed as he picks fake news purveyors and climate change-deniers for his close consiglieri. For these 24 hours the Guardian is marking the event with reporting from all seven continents on the effects of climate change happening right now, following the sun as day breaks around the world. Reports from every continent tell of rising seas, melting ice, warming tundra, scorching heat and a Gulf stream that may shift to freeze us here, as manmade global warming risks reaching the point of no return. The idea is to make us all stop and think. For example, we commentators on politics and society need to ask ourselves what’s wrong with us? Why is it that we mostly ignore this fast-approaching cataclysm, as we write about daily political dramas instead – Theresa May’s Brexit speech in Davos today, Jeremy Corbyn’s failed joke at PMQs yesterday, Boris Johnson comparing the potential behaviour of the French president to that of a Nazi prison camp guard. The trouble with climate change as a political issue is that it’s too big to grasp, too ever-present. An occasional fixed point of global decision – the dramatic last-minute signing of the Paris climate change deal – briefly flashes up on the political grid, but once over, it falls back as if done and dusted. The planet is heating up fast – but not fast enough for the hungry 24-hour news cycle. One problem: it’s hard for politicians, commentators and the public to worry about several things at once. The high-octane anxiety over Trump and Brexit absorbs all political energy: fear-fatigue can’t accommodate too much at once. Climate change is background noise, the slow roll of distant thunder. Like anyone not a denier, I am always aware of it and sometimes add “and climate change” to the list of monster crises ahead. Getting it right to the forefront of the brain, ahead of everything else, forcing politicians and public to put planet survival first, second and third in their priorities, that’s the great task. But it’s not easy. Serve up too much doom, and people despair, shrug and just hope nothing too terrible happens in their own lifetimes. Or they hope clever scientists and engineers will save us all just in time. The waterworld of Bangladesh drowning its people or the vanishing under the waves of Tuvalu are far away. Some will cling to the comfort of climate-change denial. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s chosen secretary of state, and a lifelong ExxonMobil man, uses the most dangerous subtler variety: he’s not an outright denier, but he tells Senate hearings its effects are uncertain, it exists but it’s just not that serious – though 97% of scientists are as certain as they are that smoking kills. The deranged and deluded species of denier include former chancellor Nigel Lawson, his columnist son Dominic, most of the Tory press and Owen Paterson, David Cameron’s climate change-denying former environment secretary who cut his climate adaptation budget by 40%. He told the BBC’s Any Questions four years ago that “the temperature has not changed in the last 17 years ”, though the temperature has been rising for decades, and 2016 was the hottest year on record, setting a new high for the third year in a row. Outright climate misinformation from people in authority is hugely effective: surely no minister would be so bold-faced? Besides, who doesn’t yearn for the discovery that it was all a mistake, what Trump calls a “hoax” and we are not about to boil, drown and freeze after all? A very little denial lie goes a long way, right round the world. Some, like ExxonMobil are venal, others are mad ideologists of the right who see green politics as a socialist plot or tree-hugging virtue-signalling. If they were serious, the precautionary principle would say, even if warming turns out less bad than feared, the cost of avoiding it is peanuts weighed against the high risk of human annihilation. To Westminster, climate politics smack of voter-unfriendly puritanism and self-denial, like dry January for ever – a hard sell for politicians, who instinctively veer away. Concern about the environment only rises up the agenda when the economy is thriving – in the late 80s, late 90s, 2006 – as a luxury for good times. But when most people’s incomes are still below crash levels, it’s harder to worry about the environment. Better jobs, higher growth, more of everything for everyone is the universal politicians’ message – not less of anything. European Green parties have sometimes sounded like people who relish less for its own sake. Besides, politicians urging individuals to change their driving, flying and meat-eating habits go down exceptionally badly in a society as unequal as ours. Who do they think they are, on their incomes? Let’s see the fat cats give up their private planes and Rolls-Royces first. Inequality kills in many ways – but losing the moral authority to urge restraint may fry the planet. Optimism is what successful politicians sell in manifestos of hope, change and better lives for all. The modern environmental movement has been good at balancing threats of doom with reasons why green energy and green living can foster clean growth, not kill it. What an opportunity was lost post-crash for a great green Keynesian investment surge in home insulation and new boilers, alongside a massive renewables push for wind, solar, tidal and nuclear power, with better public transport. Instead, no sooner did onshore wind become economic than its subsidies were taken away by Cameron; and just as solar was on the verge of success, George Osborne’s drastic cut in solar subsidy last year wrecked an industry, causing thousands of jobs to be lost. Read not only the warnings of impending disaster in our reports today, but the messages of hope. It can be done with political will. Greening the economy can be a motor for success not a drag on growth – and it’s for all of us, the voters, to hold the politicians’ feet to the global warming fire and fight off the reckless evil of the deniers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2015/jun/18/fukushima-power-plant-operator-knew-need-protect-against-tsunami-japan-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T13:11:33Z","webTitle":"Fukushima power plant operator 'knew of need to protect against tsunami'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/fukushima-power-plant-operator-knew-need-protect-against-tsunami-japan-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jun/18/fukushima-power-plant-operator-knew-need-protect-against-tsunami-japan-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima operator 'knew of need to protect against tsunami but did not act'","bodyText":"The operator of Japan’s ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was aware of the need to improve the facility’s defences against tsunami more than two years before the March 2011 disaster but failed to take action, according to an internal company document. The revelation casts doubt on claims by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) that it had done everything possible to protect the plant, which suffered a triple meltdown after being struck by a towering tsunami. The nuclear accident, the world’s worst since Chernobyl 25 years earlier, caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people, most of whom have yet to return to their homes. Tepco executives agreed that building coastal defences to defend the plant against tsunami higher than those previously recorded in the region was “indispensable”, according to the document, which was discussed at a meeting at the plant in September 2008 – two and a half years before the disaster. The utility disclosed the document this week during a lawsuit brought by more than 40 Tepco shareholders who are demanding damages totalling 5.5 trillion yen from company executives. Tepco has always insisted that it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck Japan’s north-east coast in March 2011, killing almost 16,000 people. In April 2012, for instance, the company said that based on expert knowledge of previous tsunami in the region, the March 2011 disaster “could not have been foreseen, and Tepco also considers the height [scale] of the tsunami that followed this earthquake to have been unpredictable ”. The company has voiced similar claims during the ongoing damages case at Tokyo district court, but Kyodo News quoted lawyers for the plaintiffs as saying that the internal document proved that Tepco “had clearly recognised as of [2008] that measures against tsunami were inevitable, contradicting the company’s explanations so far”. The document showed Tepco recognised the need to improve tsunami defences as “inevitable, as we cannot help but expect bigger tsunami than currently projected”, Japanese media said. Plaintiffs cited a government report showing that Tepco had predicted in June 2008 that the Fukushima Daiichi plant could be hit by tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres in height following a major offshore earthquake. Tepco failed to act on that prediction, and on concerns raised in the internal report, which was discussed by executives at Fukushima three months later. In response, Tepco told the court that it was wrong to conclude that the 2008 tsunami estimate would have prompted the firm to improve the plant’s defences, “because there were differences of opinion, even among experts, on how to estimate [the size] of an earthquake”, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/11/solar-and-wind-cheaper-than-new-nuclear-by-the-time-hinkley-is-built","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T10:31:31Z","webTitle":"Solar and wind 'cheaper than new nuclear' by the time Hinkley is built","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/solar-and-wind-cheaper-than-new-nuclear-by-the-time-hinkley-is-built","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/11/solar-and-wind-cheaper-than-new-nuclear-by-the-time-hinkley-is-built","fields":{"headline":"Solar and wind 'cheaper than new nuclear' by the time Hinkley is built","bodyText":"The government expects solar and wind power to be cheaper than new nuclear power by the time Hinkley Point C is completed, its own projections show. Theresa May’s government last month made a surprise decision to delay a deal on Hinkley, prompting a renewed look at what alternatives could power Britain if ministers this autumn fail to back new reactors in Somerset. An unpublished report by the energy department shows that it expects onshore wind power and large-scale solar to cost around £50-75 per megawatt hour of power generated in 2025. New nuclear is anticipated to be around £85-125/MWh, in line with the guaranteed price of £92.50/MWh that the government has offered Hinkley’s developer, EDF. On previous forecasts, made in 2010 and 2013, the two renewable technologies were expected to be more expensive than nuclear or around the same cost. This is the first time the government has shown it expects them to be a cheaper option. The figures were revealed in a National Audit Office (NAO) report on nuclear in July. “The [energy] department’s forecasts for the levelised cost of electricity of wind and solar in 2025 have decreased since 2010. The cost forecast for gas has not changed, while for nuclear it has increased,” the NAO said. The NAO cited the forecasts as coming from the energy department in March 2016. The department said the NAO had been provided with an early draft of its report, and the full version would be published soon. Niall Stuart, chief executive of the trade body Scottish Renewables, said: “These numbers speak for themselves: onshore wind and solar will be significantly better value than all other large scale sources of power in the UK by 2025. “It is time to start backing the two technologies to deliver the clean power we need to hit our climate change targets and the cheap electricity required to keep bills down for consumers.” Molly Scott Cato, a Green party MEP, said: “These latest figures confirm what many of us have been saying for years: that the Hinkley project is a dud. “The cost of renewables is tumbling and Hinkley will become a giant white elephant as it struggles to compete with cheaper renewable options. Research has shown that solar power would be a less costly way of generating the equivalent amount of power, and now the government’s own projections show that onshore wind too will be cheaper than nuclear by the time Hinkley is built.” Since coming to power in May 2015, the government ended onshore wind subsidies and allowed communities to veto turbines near them, as well as axing and cutting various subsidies for solar. Government data published on Thursday showed that renewables generated 25.1% of the UK’s electricity in the first quarter of this year. Around half of that came from on and offshore wind combined. At the weekend, high winds in Scotland helped windfarms match the entire country’s electricity needs for a day. Scotland has some of the biggest onshore windfarms in the UK, and a target of generating 100% of electricity from renewables by 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/20/renewables-serious-industrial-strategy-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-20T14:59:07Z","webTitle":"If we’re serious about industrial strategy, renewables is a good place to start","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/20/renewables-serious-industrial-strategy-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/20/renewables-serious-industrial-strategy-wind-power","fields":{"headline":"If we’re serious about industrial strategy, renewables is a good place to start","bodyText":"Cancelling the planned new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point will be a huge victory for the offshore wind industry. The word from inside No 10 is not clear yet, but there are so many Tories, including the prime minister, unsettled by the prospect of the Chinese building a plant in Britain to an untested French design that the prospects of it going ahead appear slim. As if to emphasise the continuing success of Britain’s elegant turbines in the sea, the government cleared the way for a new array off the Yorkshire coast earlier this week. The multibillion-pound Hornsea Project Two would see 300 turbines – each taller than the Gherkin – span more than 480 sq km of the North Sea. This comes after Dong Energy, the biggest operator of offshore windfarms in Britain, said it was planning to spend a further £6bn in the UK by 2020, convinced that the government is serious about supporting wind power. Offshore wind has proved expensive, but is working hard to get its price per megawatt hour below Hinkley’s £92.50. Some schemes claim to generate electricity at £85. The question now, Hinkley or no Hinkley, must be whether May can overcome the neoliberal free-market tendencies of some cabinet colleagues and push through an industrial strategy worth the name – one that embraces renewable energy and extracts business and employment for the UK from the dominant overseas firms that currently make the majority of the renewables kit. It is not so long ago that the Guardian revealed the scandalous lack of UK involvement in the London Array wind farm off the north Kent coast. Norwegian, German and Gulf companies dominated. Some will say it’s too late to challenge the big players like Denmark’s Dong or Siemens, which has brought at least some manufacturing to the UK with a £310m hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people. But that misses the point. There are plenty of roles left in suppliers and service businesses that will ramp up investment if the commitment from the government to the industry is solid. As Dustin Benton of the Green Alliance says, Britain is in a good position to build a sophisticated renewables industry that supports the generation of green energy and does the clever stuff to connect up all the various parts of the network. The green lobby group has argued that the UK could replace Hinkley by encouraging initiatives to reduce consumption – not in terms of switching off heating and lighting, but rewarding users on the basis of the electricity consumption they avoid. “Our report on reducing electricity demand … shows how the UK could get two Hinkleys’ worth of demand reduction by 2030 and certainly a Hinkley’s worth by 2025,” he says. May has much to overcome. The previous administration’s withdrawal of financial support for the solar industry after a few years of lauding it as the next big thing has made many people in the renewables sector wary. Admittedly, the state cash on offer for building solar farms was extraordinarily generous and needed to be cut, but the sudden and deep reductions wiped out much of the industry, forcing many firms to wind themselves up. It means that outside the offshore wind sector, where government support appears to be strong, firms will remain cautious. As an answer to the problem, there’s no need to adopt a North Korean approach, pumping state cash into key sectors and picking winners. An industrial strategy just needs to be more coherent, offer subsidies to achieve longer-term goals and stick with the plan while modifying it along the way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"How sun, salt and glass could help solve our energy needs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/31/crescent-dunes-concentrated-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"How sun, salt and glass could help solve our energy needs","bodyText":"High in the stark Nevada desert, a couple of hundred miles north-west of Las Vegas, is the shimmering circular mirage of Crescent Dunes. Ten thousand silvery glass panes, each measuring 115 square metres, surround a tall central tower, which stands like a twinkling needle in the featureless landscape around it. Resembling a fabulous alien metropolis, Crescent Dunes is in fact a highly sophisticated, mile-and-a-half-wide solar power plant – “the next generation in solar energy”, according to Kevin Smith, one of the project’s founders. The glass panes, which comprise a combined area of more than a million square metres, are not photovoltaic (PV) panels like those installed on rooftops and in solar farms worldwide. Instead, they are simply vast, multifaceted mirrors, which track the course of the sun like heliotropic plants. This field of mirrors harnesses and concentrates the blazing Nevada sunshine, directing it precisely towards the top of the central tower. “The difficulty with photovoltaic is that it’s intermittent,” says Smith, who is CEO of Crescent Dunes’s parent company, SolarReserve. “When the sun goes down, you’re done.” Engineers have long sought methods of storing solar energy – in water, in batteries, in fluid-filled “parabolic troughs” – but Smith claims that Crescent Dunes demonstrates “the world’s most advanced energy-storage technology”, known as molten-salt storage. The central tower secretes a reservoir of potassium and sodium nitrate – about 25,000 metric tonnes of it – heated in advance to 288°C, at which temperature the mixture is a clear, water-like liquid. This is circulated in narrow, thin-walled tubes, rising dramatically in temperature when exposed to the fearsome, concentrated sunlight at the top of the tower. “We heat it to 560°C,” says Smith, “it flows back down the tower and we capture it in a large tank.” The molten salt efficiently maintains the heat and when the energy is required, it is converted to electricity through a conventional steam turbine. This set-up allows Crescent Dunes to provide power to 75,000 Nevada homes long after the sun has set and even, if necessary, 24 hours a day.Smith believes that concentrated solar power (CSP) is not simply a substitute for photovoltaic panels but a potential competitor to conventional fuels. “It’s really an alternative to fossil fuel or even nuclear. You couldn’t power a city with just PV and wind, but you could with CSP, because of the storage capacity.” SolarReserve is already developing cheaper, higher-capacity installations and planning to build similar solar plants in South Africa, Chile and China. Of course, the technology isn’t flawless: CSP can only efficiently operate in areas with intense, uninterrupted sunlight and birds can be burned and killed by the concentrated sunbeams. Nonetheless, Crescent Dunes emits no pollutants, uses a fraction of the water required to generate coal or nuclear power and occupies a smaller combined area than, say, a coal-fired power station. Assuming the technology proves sustainable and replicable, among the ancient mountains of the American west, a bright future may be under way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/16/somerset-can-the-lib-dems-flourish-after-tim-farron-leaves-the-stage","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-16T16:00:32Z","webTitle":"Somerset: can the Lib Dems flourish after Tim Farron leaves the stage?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/somerset-can-the-lib-dems-flourish-after-tim-farron-leaves-the-stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/16/somerset-can-the-lib-dems-flourish-after-tim-farron-leaves-the-stage","fields":{"headline":"Somerset: can the Lib Dems flourish after Tim Farron leaves the stage?","bodyText":"In 2015, Boris Johnson donned a jumpsuit, lifebelt, and crash helmet for an election photo opportunity on a hovercraft in Burnham-on-Sea. If that was a predictable bit of Johnson electioneering, it is less the sort of thing that you might associate with Tim Farron. Still, last week, he followed in his Conservative counterpart’s footsteps, clambering on to the rescue craft and zooming around the treacherous mudflats of the Somerset coast with his party’s candidate for the Wells constituency, Tessa Munt. There were jokes about floating voters, and politicians being full of hot air. Activists and party supporters were rallied. And then the circus moved on. For Farron, the hope was to move the dial in a constituency that the Liberal Democrats badly want to win – and to provide a contrast with the stage-managed Theresa May, who lacks her foreign secretary’s enthusiasm for an improvised campaign stop. But in Burnham-on-Sea, the locals were not overly impressed – and their scepticism suggested something of the mountain the Lib Dems’ leader has to climb. “I’m not saying Farron isn’t a good guy,” said Geoff Lewis, 60, the owner of the Treasure Chest gift and ice cream shop opposite the hovercraft slipway. But he is not convinced campaign stunts do much to help voters make up their minds. “Very few people around here even knew he was there. It all seems a bit silly really.” The Lib Dems need to work hard on impressing people like Lewis. His is just the sort of vote they are desperate to have. And in Burnham-on-Sea, just as the Guardian found in the city of Wells last week, the fluidity of people’s voting intentions from one election to the next suggests that it is all to play for. As a student Lewis voted Labour. But since those idealistic days he has always backed the Tories. Along with running the Treasure Chest (while the Guardian was there Lewis served visitors rum and raisin ice-cream, fudge and a phallic novelty marshmallow discreetly slipped into a brown paper bag) he and his wife buy and sell property. “We’re Tories through and through,” he said. “But I’ve become very cynical since the Brexit vote. Half the people didn’t know what they were voting for. When we come out they’ll be asking what’s happened to their cheap fags and booze. I’m more worried about security and what’s happening in eastern Europe. I bet Putin is loving all this. “I’m not sure about Theresa May. I don’t know if she will get a good deal for business people if there is no effective opposition.” Nor is he convinced that the Lib Dems – the only party with a realistic prospect of challenging the Tories in Wells – are the answer. “I’m really not sure what to do.” During the hovercraft stunt, Farron repeated what is fast becoming the Lib Dems’ riposte to May’s “strong and stable” mantra. Vote Lib Dem for a decent opposition even if you’re a natural Tory, he tells people – and make sure you elect an MP who will stand up for local needs, who will keep your hospitals open, your waiting lists down, your services intact. Munt tells everyone who will listen that her opponent, the former soldier James Heappey, is a yes man who will not challenge his own party. In the city of Wells last week the Guardian found signs that these messages might be working. Even on the cathedral croquet lawn, where you might expect most players to be true blue, there was a whispered pledge from one middle-aged woman to secretly vote Lib Dem. In Burnham-on-Sea the Lib Dem promises to defend services such as health and social care might prove to be a vote-winning message. By the year 2033 half the population of the resort and the nearby town of Highbridge is likely to be aged over 65. Many voters have migrated here from cities like Bristol and Birmingham to enjoy retirement in the sea air. In general they may be less liberal with a little “L” than those we met in Wells, who include incomers from London and the south-east. But in these changing times, the impression is that lots of votes many be up for grabs here too. Just inland from where Farron and Munt were buzzing around on the hovercraft next to Burnham and Berrow golf course, there are row upon row of neat bungalows, with immaculate gardens mainly occupied by retired people. Graham – not his real name – was cleaning out the gutter of his bungalow when the Guardian asked him to share his political opinions. He got down from his ladder and swore with surprising ferocity. “I’ve always voted Conservative,” he said, “But I’ll never vote for them again.” He said his wife had a serious disability that left her confined to bed for two or three days a week. But Graham said she had been upset and humiliated at having to undergo what she saw as intrusive and insensitive Pip (personal independence payment) assessments to try to prove she was not faking it. Her payments were cut anyway. He won’t give his real name because he fears the authorities will target them further if he does. “They stole her money,” said Graham. “I think the Tories are going for the people who can’t fight back. It’s made us less trustful.” But do the Lib Dem pledges to temper a Tory landslide cut through? “I don’t like their leader. I probably won’t vote at all.” Bernard Vowles, an 81-year-old former trade unionist originally from Bristol, was polishing his car on the drive of his bungalow. He voted Ukip in 2015 – immigration is one of his big concerns – but the party is not putting up a candidate in Wells. “Labour left the working man long ago and I’ve never voted Tory. I don’t think much of Tim Farron – he just looks like a boy to me.” Knowledgable and politically engaged, Vowles appeared to be the opposite of two 20-year-olds, Connor and Mitch, who spoke to the Guardian in Wells last week, and said they could not name the prime minister and had no intention of voting. But he revealed: “I’ve spent a lifetime telling people they have to vote but I may end up not voting, which makes me sad.” On Golf Links Road, the retired joiner Colin Rufus was rebuilding the low wall between his front garden and that of his neighbour, Phillip Holland, a former soldier and teacher. The wall has collapsed, they say, because the pair spend so much time sitting on it chatting. Both are concerned about space – Rufus argued the UK is becoming too crowded because of a free and easy immigration system; Holland, born and bred in Somerset, added that he was fed up with those arriving from other parts of the UK in search of peace and quiet. “They tell me they want to come here for the quality of life. I ask them if they have thought how they will affect the quality of the life of those already here.” Rufus said he would probably vote Tory, while Holland is weighing up whether to back the Conservatives or Lib Dems. That wall between their properties might get more wear over the next few weeks. There may be a glimmer of hope to be found in the county council election results for the Lib Dems earlier this month. The Tories held the Burnham-on-Sea North seat with a slightly reduced vote share – 48% against 50% in 2013. But the Lib Dems’ share was noticeably up at 38% compared with 27%. In the tourist information centre, someone remembers that Farron isn’t even the first Lib Dem leader to take to the rescue hovercraft. A fresh-faced Nick Clegg joined Munt on it back in 2008. The information centre is run by volunteers – a sign of local authority cuts. Margaret Fielder, a retired archaeologist, and Mary Lock, a former banker, both may be swayed by those Lib Dem arguments. Fielder pointed across the mudflats to Hinkley Point looming out of the haze in the neighbouring constituency of Bridgwater. A new nuclear power plant is being built there. “That’s a white elephant. They should be spending that money on health and social care, not on that blot on the landscape,” said Fielder. The beach quickly returned to normal after Farron’s visit. Helen Meager, 41, was building what looked very much like a sandcastle but her three-year-old son Cai wanted it made clear that it was a car park. Meager reels off the issues she is concerned about – education cuts, GP waiting times, infrastructure, Hinkley Point. She would like to vote Green but sees it as a wasted vote here. “I’ll probably have to go for the Lib Dems.” The Lib Dems’ pledge to protect local services might also chime with people such as Dave Furber, who patrols the beach up near Brean Down on the north-west tip of the constituency. Like the hovercraft crews Farron met, he and his colleagues spent a lot of time saving visitors from the mud. They call the visiting 4x4 drivers who get stuck the “Birmingham navy”. Furber is also concerned at austerity-fuelled cuts, claiming the beach patrol was threatened by lost local authority funding until one of the local sprawling caravan parks stepped in to help. “Lives would have been lost if they hadn’t,” he said. Furber’s vote is still there to win – and, like so many others around here, suggests a contest that will continue to the very end. “I leave it to the very last minute,” he said. “I go into the voting booth and make up my mind there and then.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2016/jul/29/pokemon-go-players-narrowly-escape-weston-super-mare-tide","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T11:03:38Z","webTitle":"Pokémon Go players narrowly escape Weston-super-Mare tide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/29/pokemon-go-players-narrowly-escape-weston-super-mare-tide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/jul/29/pokemon-go-players-narrowly-escape-weston-super-mare-tide","fields":{"headline":"Pokémon Go players narrowly escape Weston-super-Mare tide","bodyText":"A group of six teenage Pokémon Go players had a lucky escape on Thursday night after almost getting cut off by the rising tide off Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Weston’s volunteer lifeboat crew were alerted by Milford Haven coastguard shortly before 9pm to rescue the teenagers, who were searching for Pokémon on Birnbeck Island, which is cut off from the mainland at high tide apart from the partly collapsed, and unsafe, old pier. By the time the volunteer lifeboat crew launched, two boys were spotted wading back across the shingle bank to the shore, with the tide rising rapidly to chest height, and scrambling to the shore. Four more boys walked along the pier’s unsafe walkway, which the volunteer lifeboat crew were forced to abandon three years ago, back to the shore. The police, fire brigade and local coastguard teams were also gathered at the landward end of the pier on standby. The RNLI said no one was injured in the incident. Lifeboat crew member Chris Lyons said: “It is great to see people getting out and about enjoying themselves, however, putting your life in danger trying to catch Pokémon is extremely irresponsible. “In Weston the tide comes in so quickly, in seconds you can be in life-threatening danger. Please, if you do see a Pokémon either on the rocks or in the muddy areas of Weston bay, don’t put yourself into a position where you could become stuck. “The water is unforgiving, it doesn’t give you a second chance whereas a game will.” The location-based Pokémon Go mobile game, which overlays a virtual world on real locations about the country, has rapidly become a worldwide phenomenon attracting millions of players from the US to Australia. But its use has not been without incident. On Wednesday night three girls were spotted by the police standing in rough seas near Hastings Pier in East Sussex. Earlier in the week, Japanese players were urged to stay out of nuclear power plants and the Fukushima evacuation zones, while several car crashes have been reportedly caused by distracted players. Players in Canada have also been illegally crossing the border with the US in search of Pokémon, while players in Bosnia have been warned to steer clear of landmines. Meanwhile, mine rescue crews and fight fighters had to come to the aid of a group of teenagers in Wiltshire, who became lost within a network of caves at Box searching for Pokémon.

Yet the Conservatives are odds-on with the bookies to win the byelection that is due there in early 2017 following Jamie Reed’s resignation. The odds reflect a wider scepticism at Westminster about Labour, as well as a feeling that a Tory win may bring on an early general election. There are, though, good reasons to be doubtful about almost every aspect of this. True, the Labour majority in Copeland in 2015 of less than 3,000 looks vulnerable at a time when the national polls give the Tories double-digit leads and the Labour national share is as low as 25%. Yet Labour has a decent record of holding its seats in byelections since 2015. And Copeland, like west Cumbria as a whole, is very much its own place. Providing it chooses a candidate in the Reed template – which means a pro-nuclear local candidate backed by the GMB union – and also that it fights the contest hard, then a seat dominated by the Sellafield plant may prove a tough nut for the Tories to crack. Copeland may be made of more dogged Labour stuff than London-based pundits who have never been to Cleator Moor or Egremont may assume. Providing Ukip does not withdraw to give the Tories a clear run, my money would still be on Labour at this stage. But Copeland and other recent byelections have rekindled a wider debate about UK party politics and election strategies. The matter in question is whether the parties of the left of centre, loosely defined, should be more open to electoral and political cooperation of various kinds in order to prevent the Tories re-establishing a rightwing English-based post-Brexit hegemony over British politics for the foreseeable future. For the reasons just stated, Copeland may not be a particularly good test bed for this “progressive alliance” thinking. Although the Liberal Democrats and the Greens ran candidates against Reed in 2010 and 2015, their voters are likely to be anti-nuclear. So there is little prospect of them backing a Labour candidate whose central pitch is likely to be the defence of Sellafield and the thousands of relatively well-paid jobs it generates. For the same reason, Labour has no incentive to court these voters. Nevertheless, the progressive alliance option is undoubtedly a growing debate. At its core are three propositions. The first is that the majority of people in the UK do not vote Conservative, so the non-Tory parties need to cooperate more. The second is that Labour’s historic late 20th-century dominance over the UK’s non-Tory party politics is in decline, so these forces need to cooperate if they are not to be endlessly eclipsed by the Tories. The third is that Britain needs a new 21st-century, post-industrial progressive agenda that takes more account of factors including inequality, localism and climate change. No one who writes professionally for the Guardian can dismiss any part of this. More than 100 years ago, this paper’s owner and editor CP Scott often wrote in favour of cooperation between the Liberals and the newly emerging Labour party, warning that failure to do so would mean “the Conservative dog running away with the bone”. The Guardian has editorially been broadly in favour of devolution, electoral reform and political alliances for most of the last century – and last time I looked it still was. Yet no one who tries to think objectively about modern politics can close their mind to the many problems. One of the most heretical for some readers is that supporting or opposing the Tories may not in fact be the defining divide of British politics. Those who define themselves on the left need to be open to the thought that Labour may in fact provide an equally important divide. There are also, whisper it who dares, progressive Tories as well as reactionary ones. It ought not to be a thought crime to consider that Ruth Davidson or David Willetts are more sympathetic political figures than some in the Labour party. A second problem is that the left is in a political pickle in many developed countries today precisely because it doesn’t have the answers to today’s problems, not because the political systems make it difficult to get its apparently virtuous answers across. The problems themselves are fairly easily stated: climate change, obesity, over-mighty financial services, declining real wages, widening inequality, ageing population, democratic failings. The answers are much harder. No party has them. A third and crucial problem is that active cooperation between parties eventually has to come down to nuts and bolts. Here the going gets tougher. If it involves electoral pacts, how extensive should they be? What is the policy towards the Scottish and Welsh nationalists – are they part of the alliance too? Supposing that an anti-Tory alliance won a general election: who would get to be in government, and are all MPs from the different tribes bound to support that government on all major votes? We are getting ahead of ourselves here. But it is important to know where the progressive alliance proposal is intended to lead. Even at this embryonic stage, when an alliance is still mainly an idea not a reality, the truth is that the two major potential cooperators, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, more frequently despise one another. Nothing would make them cooperate in the southern Tory seat where I live, for instance, even though the sitting MP is eminently beatable if it happened. Nor can it be taken for granted, as Copeland reminds us, that everyone who wants the Tories out shares the Greens’ hostility to nuclear power or cars. Making alliances is difficult. It means being pragmatic and tolerant. Many on the left are neither. In the end, with the massive exception of Brexit, the great unknown in British politics in 2017 is still whether the Labour party has a viable future as a party of government, not what comes afterwards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2016/sep/04/peers-must-press-new-chancellor-on-economic-growth-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-04T08:00:55Z","webTitle":"Peers must press new chancellor on policies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/04/peers-must-press-new-chancellor-on-economic-growth-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/sep/04/peers-must-press-new-chancellor-on-economic-growth-plans","fields":{"headline":"Peers must press new chancellor on policies","bodyText":"By the time Theresa May had assembled her cabinet there was only a week until parliament’s summer recess. Nice timing because it gave her team breathing space to work out what on earth to do about Brexit. MPs and peers are back tomorrow and economic policy will be under scrutiny. First up on Wednesday is the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and fellow rate-setters at the Treasury select committee. After the Bank took what its chief economist, Andy Haldane, called a sledgehammer to monetary policy by cutting interest rates and printing more money, MPs will want to hear about their thinking on the impact and limits of monetary policy amid doubts about what rate cuts can achieve when they are close to zero. That should set things up for the Lords economic affairs committee to question chancellor Philip Hammond the next day. Being the Lords, it will no doubt be a civilised affair but peers should take the chance to press Hammond, in his first committee appearance, on what measures he is considering to give the economy a fiscal boost. Even City economists and businessmen such as Sir Martin Sorrell argue the government needs to step in to promote growth, for instance by spending on infrastructure. With Hammond’s autumn statement not far off, what clues will he give to his thinking? Not such a fun summit There are no doubt times when prime ministers look forward to G20 meetings. You get to feel important and have your picture taken with other leaders of major economies, and it’s usually a chance to get away for a few days. But Theresa May is unlikely to feel in this frame of mind at her first G20 summit, which takes place on Sunday and Monday. First, it’s in China. Not only does that mean a gruelling 13-hour flight to Hangzhou, but when she gets there her hosts will demand to know what she’s up to over Hinkley Point. A year ago, China agreed to fund a third of the £18bn nuclear power station in Somerset on the understanding it would get to build two reactors of its own in Essex and Suffolk. May, who has long had doubts about the security implications of all this, put the project under review and one option appears to be going ahead with Hinkley but delaying a decision on the other two reactors. That would incense the Chinese, who want to showcase their nuclear abilities in Europe. Then there’s Brexit and its potential to upset the global economy. May is tough, but she could face a gruelling time from her fellow leaders. High asking price at builder Following share-price plunges straight after the vote to leave the EU, most housebuilders that have reported results have been fairly upbeat. Persimmon, the biggest in the sector, said buyers paused for thought and then carried on viewing. There are more to come this week, including Barratt and Redrow, but the most interesting is Berkeley. The company could – or should – face a tough time at its annual meeting near its HQ in out-of-the-way Cobham, Surrey, on Tuesday when it will update on trading. Its shares have picked up a little since their initial drop after the referendum vote, but are still down 18%, and Berkeley is likely to drop out of the FTSE 100. While all this is going on, shareholders are being asked to approve £21.5m in pay for chair Tony Pidgley, mainly from share options. Berkeley builds expensive homes in London whose prices have soared but are now falling fast. The average price of a home in the capital fell by £30,000 in a month in July, according to estate agent Haart. No one knows what effect Brexit will eventually have on the property market, but it’s fair to ask whether Pidgley, whose options date mainly from 2009, when the market was moribund, is raking in millions from a bubble that is bursting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/may/11/somerset-secret-lib-dem-voters-could-give-theresa-may-a-fight","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-11T11:59:52Z","webTitle":"Somerset: secret Lib Dem voters could give Theresa May a fight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/11/somerset-secret-lib-dem-voters-could-give-theresa-may-a-fight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/may/11/somerset-secret-lib-dem-voters-could-give-theresa-may-a-fight","fields":{"headline":"Somerset: secret Lib Dem voters could give Theresa May a fight","bodyText":"It’s a sunny afternoon on a lawn outside Wells Cathedral, and Bishop Peter Hancock is holding a croquet mallet. After a jolly speech, he turns to strike a ceremonial shot, thereby marking the start of a new season. It is a quintessentially conservative scene in Somerset. Hancock does not talk politics, but the captain of the croquet club, Guy Arnoux, is more than happy to do so. Arnoux, a retired insurance broker, is a Tory through and through, and he expects most of his fellow players are too. “The majority is pretty strong around here,” he says. “I think we’ll do pretty well again.” In fact, though, the croquet club is not quite as monolithic an organisation as it might seem. As the first games proper begin, a middle-aged female player tugs a sleeve and asks for a private word. Strictly no names. “I heard Guy say we’re all Tories,” she says. “That’s not quite right. I don’t want anyone to know, not even my husband, but I’m voting Lib Dem.” This will be the first time ever she has not voted Conservative. “Actually, I like Theresa May,” she says. “But I don’t want her to turn into a new Thatcher with a massive majority allowing her to do whatever she wants. We don’t need that. We must keep her in check.” Tim Farron would be pleased to hear this stealthy admission, echoing as it does the argument he has been making to voters across the country. (“You do not need to agree with me on everything to agree that Britain needs a strong opposition,” he said on the Today programme on Wednesday. “If you’re a democrat, even if you’re a Tory, you should believe there needs to be a strong opposition.”) And in Wells, such compromises don’t seem to be unusual. Across the constituency, an intriguing number of people with an instinctive feel for one party say they may, in the end, go down a different route. If the argument made by our anonymous croquet enthusiast really is being made more widely, it could be vital. Wells matters because it is the sort of place where a Lib Dem fightback could take place – and the sort of place that could stand between Theresa May and a rout of the opposition. The Lib Dems’ own TM, Tessa Munt, won the seat seven years ago. That was thanks to a well-targeted campaign, the force of her personality – and partly, no doubt, the sitting Tory MP David Heathcoat-Amory’s slapstick role in the expenses scandal. (He claimed back the cost of manure for his garden.) But Munt was booted out in 2015 by James Heappey, a former soldier, who took the seat with a no-nonsense majority of 7,585. Munt blames the message that an unholy Labour/SNP alliance was the alternative to David Cameron for galvanising the Conservative vote. As comfortable as Heappey’s majority seems, the Tories are not as confident as they might be. Their expectations of retaining the seat suffered a blow at last week’s local authority elections, when Munt took the seat of the Conservative county council leader John Osman in the city of Wells by 95 votes. If they weren’t taking the fight seriously before, the Tories are now. Their campaign in Wells is bound to be complicated, for this constituency is a sprawling, diverse one. Its stretch of coastline includes sandy beaches, holiday parks and the resort of Burnham-on-Sea. Further east there is hugely varied countryside, including the Cheddar Gorge, the Mendip hills and part of the Somerset Levels. They raise cattle and sheep; they make cheese and cider. The farmers are wondering what Brexit will mean for them. (Within reason, anyway: when Cheddar Valley beef farmer and Tory councillor Liz Scott was asked what the big issue was, she instantly replied: “The weather – we need some rain desperately.”) The constituency has market towns such as Shepton Mallet and Glastonbury and large villages such as Street, the headquarters of the Clarks shoe company. Then there is Wells itself, England’s smallest city and famed as the setting for the horror comedy film Hot Fuzz. It has tradition – such as the croquet on the cathedral lawn – but also incomers from the south-east, searching for a quieter life. And beneath the beautiful veneer, there are problems. Mental health services are stretched and house prices can make it hard for young people to stay. Getting a good job can be tricky for a young person and commuting to Bristol, Bath or Taunton is not easy. Like the shy Lib Dem, Wells funeral director Rod Major is another prepared to lend his vote to Munt – but he starts from a different place. He joined the Labour party a few years ago specifically because he was worried that more social housing needed to be built. He likes Jeremy Corbyn, but can’t see him as a prime minister. He argues that people with a social conscience need to send a message out to May. “We can’t have the nasty party having it all their own way. We need to make sure we get as strong an opposition as we can to her. That’s why I’ll be voting for Tessa.” Munt, too, is echoing Farron by making the case that May is bound to be PM, so her constituents should vote for a party that will form an effective opposition (“This is not North Korea,” is one of her lines) and for the person that will make the best local MP. Danny Elliott, a market trader, does not buy it. He says Munt could have his vote in the county council’s elections (“She’s a good local politician”) but he would be backing the Tories at the general election. “Tim Farron wants to take us straight into Europe again. The country has voted to leave. I won’t vote for anyone who wants to go against that.” Elliott says he has no deep-rooted connection to any party. “I’m a floating voter but I think Theresa May has the balls to sort Brexit out.” By and large, though, while the area voted to leave the EU, few people immediately bring up Brexit when asked what issues bother them. They talk about poor mobile phone signals, the patchiness of broadband, the lorries that trundle to the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant site from the quarries in Cheddar, the possibility of fracking in the Mendips, the closure of banks in Glastonbury, schools funding, GP waiting times, cuts to bus services, plans to extend a traffic-free path along the old Strawberry Line rail track route. Social worker Pete Harding is another volatile voter, but his concerns go wider than Brexit. In 2010 he went for the Lib Dems, but he became so incensed by the party’s coalition with the Tories that he stuck a poster in the window of his home in the picture-postcard town of Axbridge making it clear to his neighbours that he would never support the party again. He’s changed his mind. “I’m going to give them another chance,” Harding admits over coffee in the town’s medieval square. Harding has struck a deal with his 22-year-old son Jack, a student in Manchester. Jack will vote Labour in the north-west and Harding Lib Dem in the south-west. An inter-familial progressive alliance. “Everyone is sort of happy,” he said. Meanwhile, nine miles south-west of Axbridge, the town of Highbridge feels like it is struggling. Its thriving cattle market closed in 2007. Shops are boarded up; a food bank operates at the Baptist church. Despite it all, the Tory vote feels strong here. Many say they want a Thatcher figure. At K9 Groomers on Market Street, Diane Gay and Alison Prout are blowdrying a shih tzu called Suzie and a cockerspaniel called Ben. They complain that the heart has been ripped out of the town by the loss of the market and the building of hundreds of new homes for people who either commute somewhere else – or don’t work. “It’s a no-brainer,” says Gay when asked how she would vote. “Labour is weak. Theresa May is another Margaret Thatcher. She’ll be good for the country – a woman with balls. She’s the alpha male in all this.” Electrician Jason Wright, sitting on a wall outside Asda, claims Highbridge is being ruined by people being crammed into social housing. “This used to be a bustling place where you knew everyone. They call it the hood now. I don’t know where all these people are coming from.” He and his wife, Carianne, voted Ukip last time and Labour before that. They will probably go Tory this time. More volatile voting. And yet, in among all these volatile, highly engaged voters, it is worth remembering that there is another segment of the public who will be influential by what they don’t say – and who are a long way from the croquet lawn. Take friends Connor Baker, a barber, and bar worker Mitch Peckham. Over fried breakfast at the Boathouse cafe in Highbridge (where they are recovering from a boozy house party), they talk passionately and intelligently about the problems they and their town face. But, they say, they do not know the name of the prime minister. “I think it’s a woman – I saw a meme,” says Connor. Neither will vote next month. “Politicians do nothing for people like us and places like this,” adds Mitch. “There’s just no point at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/04/nuclear-power-stations-out-december-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-04T11:30:22Z","webTitle":"Two nuclear power stations could be out of action until December, says EDF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/nuclear-power-stations-out-december-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/04/nuclear-power-stations-out-december-edf","fields":{"headline":"Two nuclear power stations could be out of action until December, says EDF","bodyText":"Two nuclear stations that play a vital role helping to keep Britain's already fragile electricity system intact could be out of action till the end of the year, EDF Energy said on Thursday. The ongoing problems at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool reactors, taken offline last month, forced Centrica, a 20% owner of the atomic fleet with EDF, to issue a profit warning. EDF Energy said it expected the two power stations to be back in service between the end of October and the end of December but that would be contingent on a range of factors. \"During the coming weeks the programme team will focus on completing the inspections and work to build a robust case for the safe continuing operation of the boilers,\" the company said. \"This 'safety case' is subject to approval from the independent nuclear regulator, the ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation).\" The power outages following the discovery of a fault on a boiler \"spine\" at Heysham 1 have already led the National Grid to fast-forward an emergency plan to obtain more electricity from other providers to meet a possible shortfall. The Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear plants have a combined capacity of about 2.4 gigawatts (GW) and are out of action at a time when part of the 2GW Ferrybridge coal-fired station is also temporarily closed down due to a fire. The margin between supply and demand inside UK's electricity system is already very low due to the retirement of old nuclear and coal plants. EDF Energy operates 15 nuclear reactors in Britain but its other reactors have a different boiler design and the company said it did not see a risk of them suffering from the same fault. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, issued its third profits alert within nine months, saying: \"On the basis of the latest estimates for returning the reactors to service, and the associated costs, Centrica's earnings per share in 2014 are now expected to reduce by between 0.6 and 0.9 pence per share (inclusive of the 0.3 pence per share announced on 11 August 2014).\" Earlier this week, the National Grid said it was officially bringing forward by a year a scheme to tap additional capacity to cope with closures of nuclear, gas, coal and oil power stations and unexpected plant repairs. \"At this stage we don't know if these reserve services will be needed, but they could provide an additional safeguard,\" said National Grid's director of UK market operation, Cordi O'Hara."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
