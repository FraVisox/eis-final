The company, which has been in funding negotiations for more than six months, has secured the last remaining £20m from bank loans, the Guardian has learnt. It means Sheffield Forgemasters will be able to build a 15,000-tonne press to make large forgings used in modern reactors being built in the UK and overseas. The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, will travel to Sheffield, along with the business minister, Pat McFadden, to make the announcement on Wednesday. Boosting the hi-tech industrial economy in the UK will become a key political battleground in the run-up to the general election after the credit crunch exposed the dangers of becoming over-reliant on financial services. Official data recently showed that in its first decade in power Labour had allowed the manufacturing sector to shrink at a quicker rate than under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. In response, Mandelson, who has been heavily involved in the complex negotiations, has been championing a new policy of \"industrial activism\". Ministers say that without more government support for industry, the tens of billions of pounds of new reactors and wind turbines planned to reduce carbon emissions would have to be imported. British manufacturers and workers would miss out. To secure the funding, the government has pledged £65m in soft loans, with £35m from the European Investment Bank. The nuclear reactor firm Westinghouse is paying £50m upfront for its orders. The deal also provides a much-needed boost to the north-east, where traditional manufacturers such as Corus have been hammered by the recession and which has one of the highest UK jobless rates. Mandelson wants to create a hub of low-carbon manufacturers in the region with ties to Sheffield University. He recently opened a new £25m research facility in Rotherham for Britain's civil nuclear industry where Sheffield Forgemasters can work with other UK firms in the supply chain. Dougie Rooney, of the Unite union, said: \"The only hope for the nation in terms of being able to pay off its debts is for the UK's engineering industry to become a global supply-chain player supplying components and equipment for new energy projects.\" The Sheffield firm is one of only a few around the world that can make the special forgings for reactors. There is increasing political pressure on nuclear companies to source as many components as possible from the UK. The deal will create 150 jobs directly, but thousands more could be created in the wider nuclear supply chain as a result, according to Unite. Sheffield Forgemasters, whose origins go back to the 1750s, became notorious in the 1990s after becoming embroiled in the \"Supergun affair\" over arms sales to Iraq."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/17/us-debt-ceiling-deal-reaction-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T15:54:48Z","webTitle":"US debt ceiling deal fails to cheer the City - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/us-debt-ceiling-deal-reaction-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/17/us-debt-ceiling-deal-reaction-live","fields":{"headline":"US debt ceiling deal fails to cheer the City - as it happened","bodyText":"With my US colleagues covering all the latest developments in Washington and across America here, I'm going to shut up shop from London. Our summary of overnight reaction to the spending and debt ceiling deal is here Otherwise.... European stock markets have closed unspectacularly, with traders blaming profit taking, and jitters over a repeat of the debt ceiling crisis when the deal expires in early 2014. In the UK, British Gas has ignited a storm by raising prices by 9.2% (check out the twitter backlash). While a decent jump in retail sales has boosted confidence in the UK economy, and George Osborne has confirmed that Chinese firms will be welcome to invest in the UK nuclear power industry. There have also been fresh protests in Greece today. I'll be back tomorrow... Cheers all, and goodbye. GW And that's it, European stock markets have closed -- giving a resounding shrug to the news that America avoided a catastrophic default at the last minute. Why no rally? A mixture of profit-taking, and unease that the deal agreed yesterday is too short-term. Also, shares never really tumbled during the long US deadlock. The FTSE 100 just closed a measly 4 points higher, at 6576, up 0.07%. Spain's IBEX gained 0.3%, the French CAC dropped 0.1%, while Italy's FTSE MIB and Gernany's DAX both dropped 0.4%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones remains in the red, down 57 points. In the currency markets, the dollar continues to slide as economist predict that the Federal Reserve might not taper its stimulus programme until next March. The pound has now gained two cents against the dollar, to $1.6160. Matt Basi of CMC Markets commented: The US dollar has lost ground across the board today, as focus shifts to the economic consequences of the government shutdown. The dollar sell-off hints at the markets view of Fed tapering, which must surely now be pushed back well into 2014 given that we are very much in the dark as to the real effect on US growth of the shutdown until the government data departments are back up and running. Also weighing on the greenback was news that a Chinese ratings agency, Dagong Global Credit Rating, cut its rating for US debt to A- from A, following on from Fitch putting the US on ‘negative watch’ on Tuesday. Britain's strong retail sales figures for September (see here) also helped the pound. With America's fiscal crisis fixed, for a few months at least, attention may return to the eurozone again. Over in Greece, university staff and students have been holding a protest rally against the job cuts being imposed through the government's austerity programme: In a separate demo, protesters carried baskets of food and household goods as an ironic gift for finance minister Yannis Stournaras, after he said last week that members of his family were sharing in the struggle to make ends meet. And in the political sphere, there's much interest in Germany's finance ministry denying that it's working on a new aid package for Greece, to fix next year's funding shortfall. The Kathimerini newspaper has the story: A high-ranking German official has denied reports that the country's Finance Ministry is working on a new aid package for Greece. Martin Kotthaus, a spokesman for Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, on Thursday rejected the report, published in Die Zeit newspaper, as “speculation.” According to the report, Berlin is drafting a package with a number of measures aimed at easing Greek debt. The issue, Kotthaus said, will be discussed during mid-2014, adding that troika officials will continue their evaluation process before a final report is published in November or December. Kotthaus admitted that there are problems in plans to roll over Greek bonds held by European banks and other lenders, saying that several options are on the table. Over in Washington DC, Barack Obama's holding a press conference - my US colleague Tom McCarthy is live-blogging it here. He's telling the press that \"the spectacle we've seen\" in the last few weeks has hurt America, depressing its friends and encouraging its enemies. We are the indispensable nation that other people look to for support, and a place to invest, Obama added. America will bounce back. The full faith and credit of the United States remains unquestioned, he added. But Washington cannot risk a repeat of the federal shutdown, and the flirtation with a default. Obama is also urging Washington to end its pandering to special interests and bloggers and lobbyists, and focus on passing a balanced US budget. As Tom puts it, Obama sounds \" stern, taking his slightly pained, mildly sclerotic tone\". There's a live video feed here UK chancellor George Osborne's trip to China is drawing to a close, with a big announcement that Chinese firms will be allowed to invest in the UK energy sector. We've just uploaded a video clip: America's crisis officially over: My US colleague, Tom McCarthy, is back at his computer after last night's drama and has launched a new live blog covering all the action stateside as Federal workers return to their desks: US government shutdown ends as federal employees return to work – live Washington DC's Hirshhorn museum is open again, having been shuttered by the partial government shutdown. It's urging visitors to help it recover the activity lost over the last fortnight: A former chief restructuring officer from the US Treasury has warned that America cannot take risks with its credit worthiness. Jim Millstein told Bloomberg TV the federal shutdown, and the debt limit row, had been: Completely counter-productive from the point of view of getting to the main event, which is getting our fiscal house in order. Millstein said he was hopeful that real progress could be made to address America's deficit and debt mountain (around $17 trillion) over the next five to seven years. However, that means looking at tax as well as spending, which is impossible if the Republicans are only prepared to look at government spending but not revenues, he added. Goldman Sachs shares are also dragging the Dow down, dropping 2.6% after third-quarter results missed forecasts. Goldman and IBM (-6.5%), along with United Health (-3.3%), are basically responsible for the entire triple-digit drop on the Dow in early trading. Most other stocks are flat, or up a bit. Time for a summary of events so far today. The US has averted the risk of a catastrophic debt default after Congress finally agreed a spending bill to reopen the Federal government and extend the debt limit. The short-term deal, signed after midnight Washington time (read it here) gives the government the authority to borrow until early February, and also approves budget spending until January 15th. Here's the key points. Hundreds of thousands of government workers have been asked to return to their desks, as analysts ponder the political fallout. The IMF also weighed in, urging America to avoid a repeat of the debt ceiling debacle that has loomed over the global economy. The short-term nature of the deal has disappointed the financial markets, who expect a repeat of recent deadlock and conflict in the months ahead. Most European stock markets have fallen so far today. Wall Street just opened in the red, with the Dow dropping over 100 points in early trading. Early this morning, China's Dagong agency downgraded the US credit rating, from A to A-. It warned that: The government is still approaching the verge of default crisis. The dollar has lost ground in the currency markets, amid speculation that the Federal Reserve will continue its stimulus programme at the current rate until March 2014. On a brighter note, the cost of insuring US debt has dropped, and the prices of short-term Treasury bonds have risen. Financial experts are relieved that the risk of a US technical default is off the agenda, at least until early 2014. But many expect further brinkmanship and conflict on Capitol Hill in the coming months. Here's some early comment ...and here's a bit more. In Washington, Democrat and Republicans will begin discussing long-term budget issues, as part of the 'budget conference' agreed in the deal. Wall Street is open, and shares are dropping in early trading. The Dow Jones index fell by 116 points in the first few minutes, a drop of 0.7%,x to 15257. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices are also in the red, following today's losses in Europe. The Dow is being dragged down by IBM, whose shares have fallen 6% after it missed revenue forecasts last night, blaming a slowdown in China. China's Dagong credit rating agency has now uploaded its statement, confirming that it had downgraded the US by one notch to A- . Dagong Downgrades the U.S. Sovereign Credit Ratings to A- Dagong Global Credit Rating Co., Ltd. As covered earlier, Dagong is alarmed by the Federal shutdown (now finally over), and worried that America is sliding deeper towards the verge of a \"default crisis\". For example: The partial U.S. federal government shutdown apparently highlights the deterioration of the government’s solvency, pushing the sovereign debts into a crisis status. The U.S. federal government announced its shutdown on Oct. 1, 2013, a radical event that reflects the liquidity shortage aroused by depleting stock of debts without the increase of new debts, directly resulting in the federal government lack of the funds for its normal function. The partial U.S. government shutdown is an inevitable outcome of its long-term failure to pay its excessive debts. Dagong is also concerned that the US national debt will keep rising, and criticised the 'monetisation' of US liabilities through the Federal Reserve's QE schemes. The agency also pointed to the disfunction on Capital Hill: As the issue of paying sovereign debts falls into a tool that the parties make use of to realize their own interests, the political environment is unfavorable for eliminating the risk of its sovereign debt default in the long term. US short-term government debt is being treated as an ultra-safe haven again, with prices rising back to their previous levels after dipping in recent days. Makes sense, as there's no danger of America defaulting in October and November. These price rises have driven down the interest rates on one-month Treasury bills to the lowest rate since the end of September. A bill that matures on 14 November is now yielding just 0.01%, compared to 0.15% yesterday. The US dollar continues to slide. It's now lost one and a half cents against the pound, which is trading at $1.611. The euro has also gained more than one cent, to $1.365 Toby Nangle of Threadneedle Investments warns that the US dollar's status as the world's premier reserve currency has taken a knock over the last few weeks: That a technical default has been averted is to be welcomed, but the public brinkmanship involved in arriving at this temporary extension of the debt ceiling has been unpalatable and serves to further chip away at the U.S. dollar’s status as unquestioned reserve currency. Threadneedle now expect the Federal Reserve to resist tapering its bond-buying asset purchase scheme until March 2014. More here on the WSJ Jane Foley of Rabobank agrees that the Fed probably won't taper until March 2014. This promise of much more quantitative easing is pushing the dollar down, she adds, writing: Poor old dollar.... The prospect of another uncomfortable debate in government raises the prospect that the Fed could potentially defer tapering until its March policy meeting. As a consequence we will this week lower our USD forecasts across the board; our new forecasts will be published tomorrow. The weekly US jobs data has just been released, and shows that more people filed new benefit claims than expected last week. A total of 358,000 new jobless claims were filed in the seven days to October 12, down from 374,000 the previous week, but rather higher than the 335,000 that Wall Street expected. Here's some more snaps: 17-Oct-201313:30 - US JOBLESS CLAIMS 4-WK AVG ROSE TO 336,500 OCT 12 WEEK FROM 324,750 PRIOR WEEK (PREVIOUS 325,000) 17-Oct-2013 13:30 - US CONTINUED CLAIMS FELL TO 2.859 MLN (CONS. 2.915 MLN) OCT 5 WEEK FROM 2.902 MLN PRIOR WEEK (PREV 2.905 MLN) 17-Oct-2013 13:30 - US INSURED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNCHANGED AT 2.2 PCT OCT 5 WEEK FROM PRIOR WEEK (PREV 2.2 PCT) 17-Oct-2013 13:30 - US LABOR DEPT OFFICIAL SAYS NO NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN NEW CLAIMS FROM NON-FEDERAL WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN The full spending bill is online here as a pdf. Goldman Sachs bonus pool for the last quarter was around 35% shallower than last year, after the bank saw net profits applicable to shareholders, and revenues, drop. From today's results statement: The accrual for compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) was $2.38 billion for the third quarter of 2013, 35% lower than the third quarter of 2012. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for the first nine months of 2013 was 41.0%, compared with 43.0% for the first six months of 2013 and 44.0% for the first nine months of 2012. Total staff increased 3% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2013. The topline net earnings figure from Goldman is $1.52bn, or $2.88 a share, up slightly from $1.51bn a year ago. Goldman Sachs is pinning its hopes on Congress resolving the long-term uncertainty over America's budgets, as it releases its third-quarter results which showed a 2% drop in net profits compared with last year. Goldman reported a sharp drop in net revenues in the last three months, to $6.722bn compared to $8.612bn in the three months to June 30. Weak bond trading activity is one factor. Lloyd C. Blankfein, chairman and CEO, said: The third quarter’s results reflected a period of slow client activity. Still, we saw various signs that our clients are prepared to act on significant transactions and we believe that the firm is well positioned to help our clients accomplish their objectives. As longer term U.S. budget issues are resolved, we could see an improvement in corporate and investor sentiment that would help lay the basis for a more sustained recovery. Goldman also reported net profits (applicable to shareholders) of $1.429bn in the three months to 30 September, down from $1.861bn in the previous quarter, and $1.458bn a year go. UK business secretary Vince Cable has moved another step closer to launching a new business bank, by naming former Standard Chartered exec Ron Emerson as chairman (via Jill Treanor) Over on Business Insider, Henry Blodget is laying into the 144 Republicans (here's a list) who voted against the spending bill last night. Blodget's not too impressed with the deal (like most people we've quoted today): It's not a long-term deal, of course. In fact, it's not even a medium-term deal. It's a two or three month deal. Which means that the Congress-people elected to lead our country will once again soon be in their favorite position in the world: In front of TV cameras grandstanding about how \"the opposition\" is destroying the country and demanding that everyone kowtow to their every demand. But he's particularly irked that a senior player like Paul Ryan (the Republican Party nominee for Vice President in the 2012 election) could oppose a deal that fended off the default risk, saying: [Ryan] has a reputation for being fiscally responsible, on account of some budget ideas he has put forward in recent years. Ryan's vote to send the U.S. into default should delete this reputation for fiscal responsibility once and for all. Here Are The 144 Republicans Who Voted To Send The U.S. Into Default A new straw poll from Citigroup suggests America won't suffer a credit rating downgrade from a 'big three' agency (rather than China's Dagong) in the next six months: Reuters has peered into the details of the spending bill signed by president Obama shortly after midnight in Washington, and found that it contains many commitments beyond simply extending the debt limit. Amid the 35 pages are $450m for Colorado flood relief and more than $600m for fire management and fire suppression, plus money to spend up paying benefits to veterans . There's also an extra $1.2bn for a dam in Kentucky, plus fresh authority for the Department of Defense to continue to support African forces pursuing Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army. There's also no pay rise for Congress, it says: Also notable is what the 35 pages do not include. Congress likely was wise to spell out that its members will not see any pay increase as a result of the deal. The bill states that members will not receive any cost of living adjustments during the fiscal year 2014 that began on October 1. The East Coast of America is waking up to a new day with a functioning government and no imminent risk of stumbling into a debt default. Bloomberg TV has been talking about the political ramifications of last night's deal. Ian Bremmer, Eurasia group president, argued that a 'grand bargain' (of sorts) has been carved out: Bremmer said: There was a grand bargain - the Republicans have imploded, but [Barack] Obama has frittered away the first year of his second term as president. Obviously not the long-term agreement on fiscal policy which is needed. One important element of last night's deal is that the House and the Senate will set up a 'budget conference', which will deliver a report by mid-December. Peter Cook, Bloomberg's chief Washington correspondent, says that this panel will meet this morning to start discussing long-term fiscal plans. They're going to meet over breakfast... to try and get things off on the right foot. No surprise that the cost of insuring US government debt against default has fallen this morning. A one-year credit default swap (which would pay out if America defaulted) has dropped by 7 basis points to 51 bps, data provider Markit reported. It had hit a two year high of 75 basis points yesterday (meaning it costs $75,000 to insure $10m of Treasury bills). More importantly, perhaps, this is still more than the cost of a five-year CDS contract (which is trading at 32 basis points). A one-year CDS contract should be cheaper, given the risk of long-term uncertainty. But in America's case right now, the uncertainty is still in the short term. Three hours into the European trading day, and the main stock markets are all in the red as the US debt ceiling deal leaves investors underwhelmed. The French and German stock markets have fallen by 0.7%, while over in Moscow Russia's main index has slid by 1.5%. Britain's FTSE 100 is slightly lower. David Madden, IG analyst, reckons that \"traders are worried that the US will be downgraded\" by Fitch, which two nights ago put America's AAA credit rating on negative watch. Madden adds: Stock markets are not longer celebrating the deal that was struck yesterday between the Democrats and Republicans to avoid an armageddon style default – the focus has now switched to the US credit rating as traders wonder whether or not it will remain unchanged. The agreement reached has indeed brought about an end to the shutdown and pushed back the debt ceiling talks until February, but investors simply view this as the government hitting the snooze button yet again. Ratings agency Fitch is edging even closer to lowering the US credit rating, and if other agencies follow suit we could see a repeat of August 2011*. * - when S&amp;P became the first agency to downgrade the US, after the previous debt ceiling deal was raised. The US debt ceiling deal continues to get an underwhelming response in the financial world, with the FTSE 100 still in the red (down 20 points at 6551). As flagged up at 8.37am, City experts are worried that Congress only extended the US debt ceiling by four months, and only fund the Federal government until January. Many fear a rerun of last month's battles, once US politicians sit down to consider longer-term budget . Luke Bartholomew, investment analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management, calls it a \"a hollow victory for Capitol Hill\": The debt ceiling standoff has ended with the starting gun being fired on negotiations on automatic budget cuts in the form of the sequestration. That could be a good thing if it means some of the more arbitrary cuts are replaced by reasoned ones. But that will require Republicans and Democrats to cooperate which can never be assumed. The US can take a sigh of relief for now but the New Year could bring a dangerous sense of déjà vu. “These budget talks have cast a cloud over the US’s international reputation and heaped pressure on the Fed. A decision to taper QE was expected in December but the government shutdown means the Fed is deprived of the very economic data it’s said it will base its decisions on.” Here's our latest news story on the US debt ceiling deal, and Christine Lagarde's warning that America must stop flirting with disaster over its borrowing limits: US shutdown: IMF chief calls for stability after debt crisis averted Meanwhile, in the UK, British Gas has thrown more fuel on the debate over household energy prices by hiking tariffs by an average of 9.2%. Parent company Centrica announced that gas prices will rise by 8.4%, while electricity bills will see a double-digit increase of 10.4%. British Gas's increase is even higher than the 8.2% increase announced by SSE last week. It comes less than a month after Labour leader Ed Miliband vowed to freeze prizes if he won the next election. In a statement, British Gas said it was a 'difficult decision', and acknowledged that \"hard-pressed households\" are suffering as real wages keep falling. Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy, blamed wholesales energy prices and charges imposed by the government. “I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren’t keeping pace. We haven’t taken this decision lightly, but what’s pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control, such as the global price of energy, charges that we have to pay for using the national grid that delivers energy to the home, and the cost of the Government’s social and environmental programmes. Back on those reports that Dagong has downgraded the US credit rating -- journalist Alexander Smith has got hold of the full statement, and uploaded it here. Here's a flavour: For a long time the U.S. government maintains its solvency by repaying its old debts through raising new debts, which constantly aggravates the vulnerability of the federal government’s solvency. Hence the government is still approaching the verge of default crisis, a situation that cannot be substantially alleviated in the foreseeable future. Dagong should be calling me back at some point to discuss the situation.... Good economic news in the UK -- retail sales rose by 0.6% on a monthly basis in September, twice as fast as expected. The Office for National Statistics reported that spending on household goods jumped by 3.0% compared with August, while textiles and clothing spending was up 1.2%. It's another encouraging development, following yesterday's drop in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit. It's also a little curious, given wages continue to lag well behind inflation. Last night's deal to avert a US debt ceiling disaster should also cheer the high street, as the crucial festive period approached. Richard Lowe, head of retail &amp; wholesale at Barclays, says Britain could enjoy a good Christmas: September’s figures bring to a close a summer of good results and good levels of growth in the sector. Looking ahead, the high street is already filling up with glittering displays to tempt shoppers in the lead up to what we expect to be a strong Christmas. I'm still trying to find the full statement from Dagong. (its website keeps flashing up error messages). In the meantime, Reuters' IFR Markets bureau flags up that the agency also left the US rating on a 'negative outlook', suggesting it could cut the A- rating further. Here's IFR take, from the Reuters terminal: Chinese rating agency Dagong has downgraded the United States to A- from A and maintained a negative outlook on the sovereign's credit. The agency suggested that, while a default has been averted by a last minute agreement in Congress, the fundamental situation of debt growth outpacing fiscal income and GDP remains unchanged. \"Hence the US government is still approaching the verge of default crisis, a situation that cannot be substantially alleviated in the foreseeable future,\" Dagong said in a press release. Dagong's ratings are hardly followed outside of China. The agency also classifies most countries it follows very differently from major agencies such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch. For instance, like the major agencies, Dagong rates Norway Triple A. However, the US was rated A and the United Kingdom has an A+ rating with Dagong, while Moody's for one, has the UK at and the US at Aaa, the highest level on the New York-based agency's scale. Yet, the Chinese agency is not alone in pointing out that the creditworthiness of the United States is not as good as it once was. Yesterday, Fitch put the Triple A rating it gives to the US under negative watch.In August 2011, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the US to AA+ after a protracted debt ceiling debate in Congress brought the government to the verge of a shutdown. Apart from the symbolic meaning of the downgrade, though, Dagong's move is expected to have no effect on markets. Although, as fastFT points out, the gold price has risen this morning: Gold prices were higher after the reports circulated, with spot prices up $29 on the day at $1,310 a troy ounce. Even before today's reported downgrade, Dagong only classed America as a \"High credit rating\" nation, with a single-A rating. That's several notches below AAA. Why? Because Dagong has long been concerned that America's national debt is too high, and questioned whether the US is really committed to repaying its creditors (as this Bloomberg story from 2010 shows) . China's Dagong credit rating agency just downgraded America's credit rating, following the short-term deal hammered out last night, according to reports. Dagong has cut the US rating by one notch to A-, from A. Dagong has warned that the debacle over the US debt ceiling shows America's \"incapacity\" to solve its national debt crisis. The agency also cited the damage caused by the shutdown on the US economy, saying America would probably have to actually borrow even more money to cover the lost economic activity. Dagong isn't one of the Big Three ratings agencies, so this shouldn't send ripples through the financial markets. And a cut from A to A- is less dramatic than losing America's AAA credit rating (as Fitch is now threatening to do, and S&amp;P did in 2011). But it shows the concern in Beijing over the situation. After initial relief, the US dollar is also falling this morning. It's lost half a percent against both the pound (which has risen to $1.603), and the euro ($1.361). Reuters says the fall is due to traders pondering the damage caused to the US economy ($24bn of lost output, according to S&amp;P) This could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to slow its quantitative easing stimulus programme (which is pumping $85bn into the US economy each month). \"We would expect this impasse to shave off part of fourth-quarter growth and hurt consumer confidence especially from the government sector,\" said Simon Derrick, head of currency strategy at BNY Mellon. \"What this does is push back expectations of Fed tapering to early 2014 and this is dollar negative.\" The broad reaction in the City is that the US deal is a short-term sticking plaster, not a long-term fix. Analysts expect more conflict on Capitol Hill. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets predicts another battle in January. The compromise solution has the government reopened until January 15th, the debt ceiling raised until February 7th and a pledge to negotiate further deficits cuts by December 13th. While this staves off the immediate uncertainty it also means that we have to go through this entire circus again in the New Year. Talk about kicking the proverbial can down the road, the only difference is we get to use the phrase with respect to the US instead of Europe. Isn’t irony sweet? Oh joy, Happy New Year everybody! Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, believes the world economy will shake off the impact of the shutdown. The shutdown of the U.S. government will probably not have helped Q4 GDP. Nevertheless the worldwide economic upturn remains on track going into 2014. Anita Paluch of Gekko Markets reckons the Federal Reserve won't rush to slow (or 'taper') its stimulus programme: Good news – the tapering will be delayed, the bad news – the 11th hour deal is not a solution but just a problem postponed. And Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, says European stock markets are also suffering from weak corporate earnings. Overnight, we heard worrying news from IBM who blamed stalling sales in China as the reason for sliding group revenues. eBay meanwhile warned of tougher trading conditions in the US while Black &amp; Decker blamed the US government shutdown as a reason to warn on profits. In Europe this morning, we’ve another ugly set of earnings from the likes of Metso, Remy Cointreau [luxury sector posting poor numbers – LVMH missed expectations this week] while KPN shares are under pressure after American Movil pulls out its takeover bid for the Dutch telecom company. Shares are falling in early trading in Europe, as the US debt ceiling deal fails to cheer the markets on this side of the Atlantic. The FTSE 100 has dropped 17 points, to 6553. The German DAX and French CAC are also down by 0.3%. The City is disappointed that Congress didn't agree a longer-term deal. Traders are already anticipating another bruising battle on Capitol Hill in early 2014. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says there's lots of work still to do. The budget needs to be re-negotiated within 2 months, the government will be re-opened and funded for just 3 months and the debt ceiling issue pushed back for 4 months. The muted market reaction (US &amp; European futures down) suggests them already pricing in a standoff re-run in Dec, Jan and Feb. Neither party can be proud, although Democrats look to have the upper hand, showing prepared hold firm and blame ultimately being directed at Republicans (or at least factions) refusing to give up on their rejection of Obamacare. Traders have also been digesting S&amp;P's estimate that the shutdown cost the US economy $1.5bn each day -- that's a lot of missed business for firms across America, and the globe. Overnight, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim summed up the relief in the corridors of power, saying the global economy has \"dodged a potential catastrophe\". The International Monetary Fund has welcomed the news that Congress has raised America's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling before its borrowing authorisation ran out, at midnight tonight. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that America must break the cycle of uncertainty over its debt limits. She also called for the 'sequester' (deep spending cuts) to be replaced by a less harsh method of fiscal consolidation. Lagarde said: The U.S. Congress has taken an important and necessary step by ending the partial shutdown of the federal government and lifting the debt ceiling, which enables the government to continue its operations without disruption for the next few months while budget negotiations continue to unfold. Looking forward, it will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner. We also continue to encourage the U.S. to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan. Earlier today our Australian economics blogger, Greg Jericho, held a Q&amp;A on the debt ceiling deal and its implications for the global economy. Here's a flavour, on why the debt ceiling should be canned: The main thing that needs to be done is just abolish the debt ceiling. The market doesn't give a stuff about it being raised - the bond yields never go up because it is raised, they only go up when Congress threatens to block move for it to be raised. But I can't see it happening, purely because there are those who view it as a weapon in their arsenal that they can use to force spending cuts etc. But what today has really shown is that if the other side refuses to budget, the threat to allow a default ends up being an empty one. Greg Jericho answers your questions on the US debt default crisis - as it happened From Washington, my colleagues Paul Lewis and Dan Roberts report on how the deal leaves the Republican party licking its wounds: The US Congress passed legislation to rescue the country from the brink of a looming debt default on Wednesday night, bringing an end to the two-week crisis that has closed large portions of the government and revealed deep divisions in the Republican party. The bill, a temporary fix that will last only through to the start of 2014, passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement just hours earlier. But it was able to pass the Republican-dominated House shortly after 10pm only with the support of Democrats. It laid bare a rupture between moderate and more rightwing Republicans, who triggered the crisis by using their budgetary leverage in what turned out to be a futile effort to undermine Barack Obama's signature healthcare reforms. Only 87 House Republicans voted for the bill. The party leadership was opposed by 144 members, including Paul Ryan, the former vice-presidential candidate and a key figure in Congress. In brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \"lift the cloud of uncertainty\" that had hung over the country in recent weeks. My US colleagues live-blogged all the action from Washington (and quite gripping it was too). Here's their closing summary: • The House and Senate both passed a bill this evening funding the government and raising the debt ceiling until early 2014.President Obama says he will sign it \"immediately,\" as in, tonight. • The 16-day government shutdown is over. Government employees will receive retroactive pay for the shutdown period. • Fiscal talks will now shift to a budget conference between the House and Senate, where a negotiated report is due by mid-December. The talks will be led by the budget committee chairs of each chamber, senator Patty Murray and congressman Paul Ryan. • President Obama will speak tomorrow about his budget priorities. He claims that he's willing to discuss \"anything.\" • Speaker Boehner, despite passing a bill with mostly Democratic support, is not expected to lose his job. He even got a standing ovation from the House Republican conference today. Congress passes bill to raise US debt ceiling and end shutdown – live Good morning. America is returning to normality this morning after the deadlock in Congress over the US debt ceiling was broken. Just after midnight East Coast time, president Barack Obama signed legislation to reopen the Federal government, fund its operations until January 15 2013 and extend the country's borrowing authority for another four months, to February 17. So, a short-term fix, but one which averts the danger of America defaulting on its debts and triggering a financial panic. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers, many of whom have been idle for the past 16 days, are now expected to return to work --- as businesses count the cost of a two-week hiatus. The deal leaves the Republican party in some turmoil. The majority of its members in the House of Representatives voted against the bill, underlining the split between radical Tea Party members and moderate Republicans. Shares on Wall Street roared ahead as the deal neared, and Asian stock markets have mostly risen overnight. Japan's Nikkei jumped 119 point to 14,586, + 0.8% We're not expecting a big rally in Europe this morning, though. Most analysts reckoned Congress would do the right thing eventually. But the fact some members of Congress were prepared to risk a default may have caused lasting damage to America's pivotal role in the global financial system. I'll be tracking the reaction to the deal over the next few hours, along with other events across the world economy, the eurozone, the financial markets and the business world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jan/06/place-for-art-culture-participation","type":"article","sectionId":"culture-professionals-network","sectionName":"Culture professionals network","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-06T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Pitching up: where is the place for art?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jan/06/place-for-art-culture-participation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jan/06/place-for-art-culture-participation","fields":{"headline":"Pitching up: where is the place for art?","bodyText":"These are dangerous times for people and for our world of arts values. Uncertainty can cause us to be safe, edit complexity, be secretive, conservative. No waves please, the arts are in crisis. Let's just put our heads down, noses to the grindstone, and aim for preservation. \"We're all in this together\" – though some of us seem to be more 'in it' than others – gives way to \"I want to make sure my institution survives to live another day\". Battered and bruised, we go ten rounds. But what of our missions, our 'greater good', our altruism to support the things we really believe in? In my case, it's a passion for, and commitment to, doing whatever it takes to make things better for artists in society. Not to any particular product or infrastructure, that is 'of its time', in a fast-changing world. What did the riots tell us about people and their power to make a voice/place to interact with their environment? And what did the #riotscleanup tell us about participatory practices that don't rely on institutional structures? Everyone now knows how to pitch their tent – they don't 'know their place', or wait to be assigned one. However, we in the arts seem unfamiliar with the need to make a fast, timely response – art responding to situations in the world at large – let alone be able to make an effective campaign to save the arts from cuts. We are 'victims' of state patronage that on the one hand subsidises our lack of market take-up or interest, while (because of the state's rarefied/unworldly situation) controlling us by the tyranny of the wrong kinds of measurement. How can traditional compliance-led, risk-averse institutional models be the best vehicles for the level and depth of participation we are seeking for the arts to do their job effectively within society? Conrad Atkinson's 1980s work Critical mats questioned the dubious advertising slogans of Sellafield Nuclear Power Station's Visitor Centre, in an arts project sponsored rather briefly by a local bus company. Despite the niceties and instrumentality of sponsorship, art must be able to bite the hand that feeds it – that's its place. So perhaps his work was 'out of place'? But as Julie Crawshaw commented in Value of making (value): \"Rather than fitting art practice to ever-changing measurement criteria – or setting norms (\"will look like…\" ) or attempting to predict behaviours, perhaps we in the arts – the arts activists – should be comfortable with what is not normal, what is unpredictable, what is, and make better sense of that.\" Joshua Sofaer said: \"Over the first 10 months as Artist Fellow on the Clore Leadership Programme, I have been thinking about how artists can really make a difference in the societies they find themselves in. This is not about 'making the case' for the arts under the harsh interrogation of media cynicism during a time of cuts, but rather a proactive investigation of what art can do affirmatively, especially in situations of need.\" Do and can buildings run by permanent institutions respond fast to situations of new need? 48% of Arts Council England's visual arts NPO funding (£21m) goes to a 'Top 20' of galleries/production agencies. ACE saved just £1.36m by cutting 16 artists' production/practice-driven organisations. The Oscar Niemeyer Centre in Aviles, Spain is run by a permanent staff of only four with a glittering array of specialist artistic advisers. This is a novel approach to resourcing and drawing on artistic specialism that the UK might care to investigate further. Are arts buildings the 'place for art' or could they in future be viewed as memorials to the heady, finance-at-the-ready pre-2007 era? Are buildings, as run by institutions, self-serving? How will their viability/sustainability be affected by rising energy and transport costs and the engagement preferences of an ageing population with less disposable income? Are \"arts organisations well-placed to lead the creativity and innovation that will be a driver of economic recovery\" as Arts Council England sets out in Achieving Great Art for Everyone? Or as Julie Crawshaw comments: \"[is] Art practice something that sits, walks, jumps up and down, amongst, on top of and in between [the institutions].\" Just like people do when they create a riot, pitch a tent, or otherwise change the world. In my opinion we must beware of over-reliance on this events-based, instant gratification based culture which, unless there is widespread buy-in and participation in the arts by all sectors of our society, is clearly unsustainable without the largesse of public funding. The RSA Citizens Power project, Experiments in Place Making, enables locally based creative practitioners to investigate how their creative practice can engage people with each other and where they live. Creative practitioners are partnered with Neighbourhood Managers to identify a local challenge. The partnership presents an opportunity to explore and develop innovative and collaborative practices. At the same time, a network of artists has set up Creative Peterborough to \"champion the arts and local creative practitioners in the city.\" Citizen Power recognises that Creative Peterborough are well placed to build on the legacy of a stronger, confident and inclusive arts community, which is raising funds, developing audiences in and beyond the city, creating jobs and boosting the economy. So is 'the place for art' in temporary institutions that can quickly foster meaningful, timely participation and create a bigger bounce? Julie Crawshaw says: \"The world is looking for new ways of seeing. Art practice – the collective performance of art making (between materials, artists, artworks and others) is an inherently inter-disciplinary reflexive process that supports us to rethink and reconsider our realities. Arts organisations are an organisation of artists and others, materials and bits and bobs. They are art practices: perhaps a 'bigger' collective artwork.\" Arts organisations, says Cranshaw, \"have a capacity for bigger reflection in our collective place. However, to see the big, we must observe the small carefully.\" As Irene Lucas, former director general of the Department for Communities and Local Government, says: \"Places change for the better when you give people the power to do things differently. That takes courage and genuine commitment to new thinking and ways of working on the ground.\" It is these concepts, for me, that present the real challenge for art and its 'place'.

Hertford Regional College (HRC) has set up a framework agreement with Thor Data Center in Hafnafjordur, just south of Reykjavik, to provide storage and a platform for running applications. It is now migrating its own data to the site and is talking to other institutions about using the facility. Daniel Hidlebaugh, the college's chief technology officer, says the move was prompted by the need to make savings while meeting green targets and building in sufficient resilience. It did not have the resources to provide 24/7 support for an in-house data centre and looked for an outside provider. The Thor facility is run on geothermal energy which is present throughout Iceland; usually tapped by drilling a few hundred feet below ground. It is also west of the volcanoes which erupted last year, and as the prevailing winds are west to east it is away from any areas affected by ash. The centre has a power usage effectiveness ratio that is consistently close to 1:1. This is kept down by the fact that, even in the winter when the outside temperature is too cold for the servers to run, the geothermal energy provides the heat to compensate for this. In addition, the local temperature seldom rises above 16ºC in the summer, which removes the need for power to cool the centre. \"It's a closed system that helps everything run at a low consumption rate,\" Hidlebaugh says. Another potential advantage is in helping organisations keep down their carbon emissions. With the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme now in operation, those that use excessive amounts of energy will be subject to fines. Hidlebaugh says the centre will provide a route to avoiding any charges, and that it can do a bit to alleviate a national problem. \"We have a finite amount of power here, and there are some colleges that don't have the power to plug in one more server. The resources have become very finite, so what do we do? It takes 10 years to build another nuclear power supply and there are all sorts of issues with wind, so by putting it into another data centre in the UK it doesn't help us. \"But by moving it out it helps us to go green because their data centre is carbon neutral, it saves us from drawing on the power grid in the UK, and it gives us long term stability in power. \"The power costs were significantly less. Where we were paying anything from 9-11p per KwH, and that is going to increase by 10%-15% every year for who knows how long, we have it at 4-5p per KwH hour guaranteed over the next 10 years. It's a significant saving for us,\" he explains. HRC has been able to set up multiple connections, with a bandwidth of 10Gbps, through Janet, the UK's network for higher education and research. This provides an encrypted channel from any educational institution in the public sector into the Thor data centre. By mid November HRC had migrated about 6Tb of data to the site as part of a programme to move more than 30Tb by the end of January. This is being packaged into large SAN devices which are air freighted to Iceland and after the data is transferred air freighted back to the UK. Hidlebaugh says it provides the scope to run most of the applications used by the college through the centre. \"We'll be running finance, HR, Moodle (an open source learning application) and others, just about any application that we don't require to be here, things like access control and CCTV. We can manage it remotely; it's on our IP network so we can log in just as if it's sitting next to us.\" He says there are no regulatory problems attached to storing data in Iceland, as it is considered \"near EU\" for data protection purposes and it is acceptable for information, including student records, to reside there. While Hidlebaugh evangelises the green elements of the move, he also claims the business is set up in a way that will provide an attractive option. HRC has signed an exclusivity deal with Thor which makes it the channel, taking a 3% cut of the business, for any public sector education institutions that want to use the centre. Janet will provide the infrastructure for connections, and Hidlebaugh says that the prices for hosting and cost per rack will offer significant savings. The deal has been set up through an framework agreement working on an \"open book\" basis, in which the prices will remain constant throughout its four year lifetime. It's also crucial, he says, that for the UK end of the business it is being kept within the public sector. \"The private sector tends to look at education as a cash cow, and even though our budgets are decreasing they're still huge in terms of private sector business,\" he says. \"I've always had a perception that education should be for education, that we should help each other out and try to stop the commercial barracudas out there. \"Basically that's what this is – education for education, and that's become our tagline.\" This article is published by Guardian Professional.

As Nicholas Watt reports, the German chancellor opened her speech to a joint session of the UK parliament in English to drive home her message of Britain’s central role in the EU, coupled with a warning that the patience of the EU’s other 27 leaders with the UK is finite. • Cameron has ordered a judicial inquiry into the way letters have been sent to IRA fugitives telling them if they are able to return to the UK without fear of prosecution. (See 3.34pm.) • Alex Salmond has played down suggestions from Standard Life that it could leave an independent Scotland by insisting the company would prosper after independence. • A shock rise of more than 30% over the past year in net migration to Britain to 212,000 has dashed Conservative hopes of meeting their target of reducing the figure below 100,000 by the time of next year’s general election. • Alan Milburn, the government’s social mobility adviser, has described the government’s new draft child poverty strategy as “a serious missed opportunity”. As the Press Association reports, Miliburn said Iain Duncan Smith’s failure to reach agreement with George Osborne over his plan to rewrite the official definition of policy was “beyond Whitehall farce”. The strategy, which was released for consultation by Duncan Smith, the work and pension secretary, in a written statement to Parliament, restates the government’s commitment to end child poverty by 2020 and promises to “tackle poverty at its source” but contains no new policy proposals to help the poorest families. After reportedly clashing with Osborne over his heavily-trailed plans to rewrite the definition of poverty to include factors like educational opportunity, worklessness and parental addiction, Duncan Smith has agreed to put the idea on hold, saying in a joint article with the chancellor that “this is such an important issue - it is vitally important that we take the time to get it right”. In a blog post on the social mobility and child poverty commission website, Miliburn strongly criticised the strategy. It is a document without teeth. That’s because it lacks any clear measures against which the Government can be held to account. A strategy which cannot be measured is meaningless. Despite taking more than a year to think about it, the government has drawn a blank, apparently unable to reach agreement on what a new set of measures should look like. The Government has ended up in a no-man’s land where it has effectively declared its lack of faith in the current measures but has failed to produce an alternative set. This is beyond Whitehall farce. • MPs have hears that thousands of benefit claimants are dying within six weeks of being wrongly assessed as being fit to work because of the government’s “scandalous” welfare reforms. The Labour MP Ian Mearns made the claim in a Commons debate on the impact of welfare reforms on the sick and disabled. As the Press Association reports, Mearns compared the coalition to “oppressive regimes in Central and Latin America”, blaming ministers for misdiagnosing at least 10,600 sick and disabled people as being fit for work. Put bluntly, this government, the Department for Work and Pensions and their agencies are telling us repeatedly that people who are dying are fit for work. Between January 2011 and November 2011 some 10,600 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) claims ended and the date of death was recorded within six weeks of the claim end. This government has repeatedly refused to release updated 2013 [figures] for deaths within six weeks of an end of an ESA claim. Four people a day are dying within six weeks of being declared fit for work under the Work Capability Assessments; it is scandalous. Scandalous and an indictment of this place. Opening the debate, on a motion calling for an inquiry into the impact of welfare changes on the sick and disabled, Labour MP John McDonnell said a commission should be set up to investigate issues like the excess deaths of welfare claimants, Universal Credit’s IT roll out, the use of Atos to conduct work capability assessments and the Remploy factory closures. He said many people felt “hounded” just for being disabled. We met some of the campaigners this morning. Some of them said these expressions: ‘Do they realise that many of us feel terrorised by what the government is doing?’ One disabled campaigner said to me: ‘Can you tell them that they call their programme fulfilling our potential but we feel many us of simply won’t survive this round of cuts. A generation is going to be lost.’ That’s why the central demand of this petition is very straightforward. Today’s motion is to call in essence for a cumulative impact assessment of all the welfare changes that have been introduced by this government. McDonnell’s motion was passed unopposed although that does not mean there will be an inquiry, because the government routinely ignores backbench motions like this. In the debate, Mike Penning, the disabilities minister, said that different aspects of government policy were regularly reviewed, but that a cumulative impact assessment could not be carried out properly. • A security services watchdog, Sir Mark Waller, has been summoned to appear before MPs after he repeatedly refused to appear to answer their questions over the Edward Snowden leaks and other counter-terrorism issues. That’s all from me for today. Tomorrow I will be writing a blog from the Ukip spring conference in Torquay. And on Saturday I will be blogging from the Labour special conference in London. Here’s the Guardian video of Merkel’s speech. Here are two good blog posts on the Merkel speech. • Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist’s Blighty Brighton blog says Merkel’s speech illustrates how little influence Britain now has in the EU. The German chancellor’s one-day visit to London follows days of optimistic briefing from Downing Street that she would help David Cameron in his attempt to placate backbenchers by repatriating powers from Brussels. Predictably, Ms Merkel’s comments did not live up to the hype. Her speech was friendly enough, and briefly nodded to shared priorities like liberalisation and economic competitiveness. It even hinted at the need to find appropriate legal instruments to enact the necessary changes—echoing the prime minister’s insistence on treaty change. But it was also spectacularly vague. It barely mentioned Britain’s current debate on Europe. Nor did it come close the sort of commitments that would enable Mr Cameron to convince many of his MPs (and some in his cabinet) of the case for EU membership. Instead, the German chancellor used a sweeping account of European history to discuss the need to integrate the euro zone, the violent geopolitical convulsions on Europe’s eastern borders and the union’s common security and defence policies. To the Britain of the turn of the millennium, this order of priorities would not have come as a surprise. Back then the country was arguably the most influential in the union ... But today, as the oddly unrealistic expectations of Ms Merkel’s speech showed, it is narrowly focused on squeezing concessions (currently so vague as to be virtually meaningless) out of its partners, all while threatening to flounce out of the union all together. • James Forsyth at Coffee House says that Merkel’s speech “didn’t close doors on EU reform but nor did it open as many as some close to Cameron had hoped that it would”. Here is what David Cameron said about a judicial inquiry into the letters sent to IRA fugitives. I agree with the First Minister of Northern Ireland that, after the terrible error in the [John] Downey case, it is right to get to the bottom of what happened. The case has already been referred to the Police Ombudsman but, as the first minister has said, we should have a full, independent examination of the whole operation of this scheme. So I can announce today that we will appoint an independent judge to produce a full public account of the operation of this administrative scheme to determine whether any other letters were sent in error. Cameron said the judge would be given “full access to government files and officials” and would report by the end May. Later, in answer to a question, he appeared to defend the general decision to sent out letters of this kind. When we came to power in 2010, we inherited a process where letters were sent, setting out the factual position on whether or not some individuals were wanted for questioning by the police. This process continued under this government. There was never any amnesty or guarantee of immunity for anyone, and there isn’t now. It is right that we take swift action but let us also remember that Northern Ireland has made great strides forward as a result of the peace process. David Cameron will be relatively pleased with that press conference. In her comments about migrants and benefits, Angela Merkel went further than she did in her speech in backing Cameron’s agenda. (See 3.04pm.) But Cameron has talked about going further, and restricting free movement of labour within the EU for new entrants which much poorer than the EU average (ie, Turkey). Merkel did not address this, and her comments about preserving “this freedom” (see 2.03pm) suggest she’s not in favour. Q: [To Merkel] You were received like royalty today. How do you feel about that? Merkel says she wore blue today to offset the red carpet that has been rolled out for her. And that’s it. (The final question came from a German journalist. The consensus in the Guardian office was that it was a terrible one, particularly at a press conference where only four questions were allowed.) Q: [To Cameron] Do you think the process of sending out letters to IRA fugitives was flawed? Cameron says it was a mistake for John Downey to be told he was not wanted for crimes when he was. That is why it is right to have an inquiry into other mistakes were made. He says he thinks Peter Robinson will welcome that. On the general point, he says he does not want to unpick the difficult decisions made in the past. These letters were not an amnesty. Q: [To Merkel] Is it true you view Cameron as a “naughty nephew”. Merkel says in the EU all members have to stand up for their own interests. Then they have to weigh up the consequences. Many hot potatoes have been solved in this way, she says. She says “David” stands up for his interests. She stands up for hers. They get a solution in the end. The next question comes from a German journalist. Q: Would you worry about the Conservatives being in different groups in the European parliament? Cameron says the Conservatives are in the ECR group in the European parliament. Their sister party in Germany is the CDU (Merkel’s party.) Merkel says she is fighting for the CDU in the election. She is glad that Cameron views it as a sister party. They are now taking questions. Q: [To Merkel] Is there any chance of the reforms Cameron wants to the EU being achieved? Merkel says when she was discussing changes to the EU budget, she was not sure she could get those changes through. But they did. That shows that where there’s a will, there’s a way. Q: [To Merkel] You said that there were problems with free movement. What do you mean? Merkel says she is a great champion of freedom of movement. But if we were to see freedom of movement resulting in people coming to Germany and getting the same unemployment benefits as someone who has been in the country for 30 or 40 years, that would not be right. No country in Europe could withstand an onslaught like this. This is just as much of a problem for us in Germany as you in Britain. We need to look at this. Can we change our own laws? Britain suggests changes to protect non-euro countries. We can find solutions to this. We did this over banking union. It is not a piece of cake. It is going to be a lot of work. But we have worked hard on other issues, she says. Q: [To Cameron] Shouldn’t you admit now that you will not get the changes you want. Cameron says the changes he wants are possible and deliverable. On benefit tourism, Cameron says he wants to see the rules changed. Merkel is speaking now. She says she looks forward to welcoming Cameron to Germany in two weeks’ time. On Ukraine, she says its territorial integrity is of tremendous importance to us. But, in her talks with Vladimir Putin, Putin has said the same thing. There is a large Russian population in Ukraine. They must be reflected in the government, she says. On Northern Ireland, Cameron says a dreadful mistake was made in the case of John Downey. Letters were sent to IRA fugitives setting out the facts about whether they were wanted by the police. Cameron says a judge will carry out an independent inquiry. • Cameron announced independent judicial review into the process of sending letters to IRA fugitives telling them whether or not they could return to the UK without facing prosecution. It will report by the end of May, he said. Cameron says they discussed Ukraine. He and Merkel both want a democratic Ukraine. They are particularly concerned by events in the Crimea, he says. This is not a zero-sum game. It should not be about forcing the Ukrainians between Russia and the EU. Cameron says there is a strong partnership between the UK and Germany. He says he has a substantial agenda for EU reform. It will concentrated on promoting growth. He set out his vision for a reformed EU in his Bloomberg speech last year, he says. They have discussed some of these proposals, such as cutting regulation, today. He says he wants Britain to be a positive player in a reformed EU. The press conference is starting. David Cameron and Angela Merkel are sitting down, unusually. (Merkel injured her hip, I think, in a skiing accident recently.) The Cameron/Merkel press conference is starting shortly. It will be relatively short. Downing Street said earlier this week that it would follow the standard “two by two” formula that they use for these press conferences with foreign leaders (two questions from the UK press, two from the foreign press). Earlier I described Mark Pritchard as a Labour MP. (See 1.35pm.) I’ve corrected that, because he is, of course, a Conservative. I’m sorry about that. Here are some of the key extracts from Angela Merkel’s speech. • Merkel said that she was not announcing her support for fundamental reform of the EU. She made this point at the start of her speech, when she was still speaking in English. It was as if she wanted to be sure this point was not misunderstood. Some expect my speech to pave the way for a fundamental reform of the European architecture which will satisfy all kinds of alleged or actual British wishes. I am afraid they are in for a disappointment. This reads like a snub to David Cameron. But it was not entirely clear whether she was ruling out “fundamental reform” for good, or just saying that she was not planning to announce her support for it today, and this ambiguity marginally minimised the impact on Cameron (although there was very little in the rest of the speech to suggest that she does favour wholesale EU reform). • She said she did not want the UK to leave the EU. This came immediately after the passage quoted above, and was again in English. Others are expecting the exact opposite and they are hoping that I will deliver the clear and simple message here in London that the rest of Europe is not prepared to pay almost any price to keep Britain in the European Union. I am afraid these hopes will be dashed. Again, this was smothered in ambiguity. Note the double negative - “I am not saying that Germany won’t pay any price to keep Britain in the EU.” But does that mean Germany will pay any price to keep Britain in? Of course not. • She said she wanted to preserve the EU’s freedom of movement principle - but hinted that she might be willing to amend the way it is implemented. A Europe without borders is one of the greatest achievements of European unification. All member states, all citizens benefit from this. But it is also true that, to maintain and preserve this freedom of movement and gain acceptance for it from our citizens, even today, we need to muster the courage to point out mistakes and tackle them. This had everyone scratching their heads as to what she really meant. See 12.51pm. • She said the EU had to change. Standstill may quickly turn into setback. Or to use a famous quotation of Winston Churchill, ‘To be perfect is to change often’. • She said she wanted the EU to be strong in the future. Our ideas of how the future European Union will look like may vary on the details but we, Germany and Britain, share the goal of seeing a strong, competitive European Union join forces ... United and determined we can defend our European economic and social model in the world. United and determined we can bring our values and interests to bear in the world. United and determined we can serve as a model for other regions of the world. This and nothing less than this should be our common goal. This illustrates a fundamental fault-line, because many Conservative MPs want the EU to be weaker. • She said she saw Britain as an important ally in her quest for EU reform. We have to tackle the great challenges of our times together. Individually and on our own I am deeply convinced we will achieve less than if we stand together. Less as regards defending our common values and less as regards preserving and maintaining the prosperity of our citizens in this global competition. This will only work, however, if we make the European Union a better place. I, as German Chancellor, see Britain as an important ally in this endeavour. • She said Germans were grateful for the forgiveness shown by other European countries after World War Two. We Germans shall never forget that we owe the happy and prosperous development of our country to the readiness of our European partners and friends to forgive and to stretch out the hand of friendship and reconciliation. • She praised Britain for its stand against Nazi Germany. What would have become of Europe if the people of this country - your country - had not put up such courageous resistance, part of the time standing all alone? What would have been the consequences if you had not found the strength to protect your way of life and to keep alive the hopes of all the nations of Europe for a better future in freedom? The United Kingdom has no need to furnish proof of its commitment to Europe and its basic values. • She accepted that Germany was to blame for World War One, as well as World War Two. This is a special year of commemoration for Britain, where you remember your dead, your losses and the untold losses that Germany brought through these wars to you. As German Chancellor, I bow my head before the victims of these horrible wars. And here is some political reaction to the speech from Twitter. It is noticeable that Labour and Ukip figures seem a bit happier about the speech (because they think it is not giving David Cameron what he wants) than Conservatives. From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s spin doctor From Labour’s Mary Creagh From Lord McDonnell, the Labour former Scottish first minister From the Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood From Conservative MP Mark Pritchard (Earlier I mistakenly labelled Pritchard as a Labour MP. Sorry.) From Labour’s Chuka Umunna From Stewart Wood, a member of the shadow cabinet and Ed Miliband’s policy adviser From Labour’s Pat McFadden From Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary From Chris Bryant, the Labour former Europe minister From Tim Aker, Ukip’s head of policy Earlier I quoted a tweet saying Nick Clegg would not be meeting Angela Merkel. (See 11.55am.) In fact, Clegg’s spokesman tells me Clegg is with David Cameron in a meeting with Merkel now. Here is some reaction to the speech from journalists and commentators. I’m told that Cameron had an earpiece. He was not wearing the headphones because they look terrible in photographs. A colleague points out (rightly) that you almost never see Cameron looking silly or undignified on camera. His team are very good at taking care about this. Here’s the red carpet I was talking about earlier. (See 8.50am.) That was quite a speech - sweeping, serious, but also artfully opaque. For example, it had the FT’s Gideon Rachman tweeting this. While the Independent’s John Rentoul was tweeting this. Adam Boulton summed it up nicely. I’ll post more Twitter reaction soon. Merkel reverts to English for her peroration. United and determined, Europeans can preserve their social model, she says. And they can extend prosperity. This is the task for the EU. Merkel says the EU needs a strong Britain in the EU. And she quotes again from the speech by the German president, Richard Von Weizsäcke, to both Houses of Parliament in 1986. And that’s it. I will post a summary and some snap reaction soon. Merkel says Germans will never forget that the happy and prosperous development of their country is linked to the EU. And they know their prosperity has been linked to the willingness of neighbours to forgive, and to extend the hand of friendship. Merkel says investment in science and research should be a priority. Without investment, we will fall behind. In the internet, we are no longer the best. That needs to change, she says. If we are serious about change, we will find the necessary legal instruments to achieve those goals, she says. (Was that a reference to treaty change?) Merkel says in the future the taxpayers should not foot the bill when banks make mistakes. The financial sector should foot the bill, she says. This is important for London. Merkel says unnecessary red tape at the EU level must be cut. The EU must measure up to the best regulations in the world. If measures are superfluous, they should be scrapped. She says the EU should only intervene where member states have not acted. The principle of subsidiarity needs to be more fully observed. Merkel says countries that are members of the euro must combine monetary union with economic coordination. Only by doing this can they avoid getting into heavy waters again. All euro member states will then have to submit their policies to scrutiny. Merkel says we in Europe will only still have own history if we stand together and remain together. As European nations, we should live up to two principles: responsibility and solidarity. There are more than 7bn people on the world. Some 500m live in Europe, she says. She says she sees Britain as an important ally. The EU must become stronger, she says. It must rally round and focus on the challenges of our time. Although Europe has 25% of the world’s economy, in the future 90% of growth will come from outside Europe. To benefit from this, we need to bring down barriers to trade, she says. The proposed EU/US free trade agreement is particularly important. She says she is pushing for a result. But that result must include issues of privacy and data protection. Merkel says the causes of the crisis were essentially self-made. Countries built up too much debt. In coping with the global financial crisis, it is not sufficient to merely muddle through, she says. Our ambition should be to emerge stronger than when we went in. Merkel says freedom is secured under the rule of law. Germany and Britain want to tap the potential of the single market. This is necessary to fulfill the third promise of Europe, so that it can adapt to the times. For a long time Europeans thought it only natural that economic development would only move upwards. The single market is a success story virtually unparalleled in the world. But the economic crisis has highlighted the problems. Merkel says we need to reform the shape of Europe in keeping with the times. That is so we can honour its commitment to freedom. Democratic freedoms and market freedoms belong together. All EU citizens benefit from the single market. But he must muster the courage to point out mistakes, and tackle them, she says. Merkel says the EU still needs to stand up for peace. It must also empower others to settle conflicts peacefully. Britain and Germany work together to attain this, she says. We jointly work for better cooperation between Nato and the European common defence and security policy. Merkel says when the EU was set up, people thought it would stop future wars. Now people think this goal is irrelevant. It is true that a war between EU members is inconceivable. But, remember, she says, the last war in Europe took place only a decade ago. There are still troops in the Balkans. Merkel says politicians now must show responsibility. In 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the start of the EU, EU leaders promised to constantly renew Europe. They said they would renew it in line with the spirit of the times. Merkel says we should lend our support to the people of Ukraine when freedom and the rule of law needs to be protected. The fall of the Berlin Wall brought almost unbelievable happiness, she says. She is a personal example of how that brought real change. There are now 28 members of the EU. It is a miracle. But it is also a tribute to the work of far-sighted politicians like Churchill, she says. We live in a political order where the fate of Europe is not just decided by a small group of people, using secret diplomacy. All 28 countries are involved in decisions, she says. Europe has changed for the better. Thanks to the peaceful revolutions, further borders could be overcome. What would have happened if you had not found the strength to protect your way of life, she asks. The UK has no need to prove its commitment to Europe. This is a quotation from the German president, when he addressed both Houses of Parliament, she says. She says she agrees. She is grateful to the UK for placing trust in a democratic Germany after WW2. She says she wants to thank the 1.7m British servicemen and women who have served in Germany. (Merkel is now speaking in German. But there is a translation.) She says that, as someone who lived for 35 years in Eastern Germany, she feels particularly close to the freedom and democracy that this parliament represents, as few other institutions do. For centuries European relations were marked by bloodshed, she says. The anniversary of the start of the First World War makes it important to remember the past, she says. WW1 was the first great catastrophe of the 20th century. It was followed by another 75 years ago, when WW2 started. Merkel says she can express her thoughts better in her native language. She hopes they will forgive her for delivering the rest of the speech in German. Merkel says she has been told there are high expectations of her speech. Some people hope she will pave the way for fundamental EU reform. They will be disappointed, she says. And others think she will say that Germany will not pay any price to keep Britain in the EU. Those expectations are not true either, she says. She says her pleasure at being here today is great. She wants to share her thoughts on Europe with them. Angela Merkel starts, in English, thanking both Houses of Parliament for inviting her. She is the third German to have this honour, she say, following Willy Brandt, the West German chancellor, in 1970 and Richard Von Weizsäcke, the West German president, in 1986. She says she will never forget her first visit to London in the spring of 1990. It was before German reunification. She visited the Royal Institute. And she went to Hyde Park looking for Speaker’s Corner, which to her was the symbol of free speech. She hopes that is not an insult to you parliamentarians, she says. Bercow tells Merkel she has been Europe’s anchor at a time of potentially catastrophic change. He says she has also set a remarkable example to the world as a female leader. In particular, she is a leader whose word can be absolutely trusted, he says. He introduces “Dr Angela Merkel”. John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, is introducing Merkel. It is a rare moment when a head of government, not a head of state, addresses MPs and peers in this place, he says. But it is amply justified. The links between Britain and Germany are strong. And the links between the two parliaments are very strong. The new German parliament was largely designed by Lord Rogers. Bercow says if we ever needed to redesign Westminster, he hopes that we would be as open-minded. It is unusual for MPs to have doctorates, he says. And those MPs with doctorates have them in social sciences. But Merkel’s is in a hard science, physics. Bercow reads out the title. (It’s quite complicated.) Angela Merkel has just entered the Royal Gallery. Here’s the scene in the Royal Gallery where Merkel is speaking soon. The Sun’s Steve Hawkes says Nick Clegg is being snubbed. UPDATE AT 1.22PM: Clegg is meeting Angela Merkel, his spokesman tells me. See 1.22pm. Here’s a Merkel/Cameron reading list. • Martin Kettle in the Guardian says Angela Merkel cannot possibly offer David Cameron what he wants. Merkel’s visit cannot possibly deliver what Cameron wants it to. Number 10 has marked Merkel down as the Tory leader’s most important potential ally in his attempts to deliver a “yes” vote in the referendum about Britain’s renegotiated EU membership he hopes to hold in 2017. But although there is a common Merkel-Cameron interest in British membership, the massive gulf over Europe between the two leaders has not suddenly disappeared. Yesterday, it was reported that Merkel is ready to offer Britain special opt-outs in any revised EU treaty, strengthening the institutions and harmonising the processes of the eurozone countries. That would be good news for Cameron if it were to happen. But it was simultaneously reported that Merkel’s speech will call for a much more effective EU, stressing that changes must be carried out in order to strengthen – not weaken – the EU as a whole. That might not suit Cameron quite so well. This gulf is exceptionally hard to bridge. Merkel wants a stronger EU with more shared approaches and bigger global clout. Cameron actually wants the opposite – a weaker EU with much greater internal flexibility that plays only a limited role on the world stage. Each position reflects the respective politics of the two nations. • Nicholas Watt and Philip Olterman in the Guardian make a similar point. One senior coalition figure said any concessions offered by the Germans would amount to “chickenfeed” that would not satisfy Tory eurosceptics. “David Cameron will get some concessions but it will lack powder and shock. There is an interesting parallel with Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan before the 1975 referendum, who trotted round the capitals of Europe getting a packet of matches rather than a cigar and hailed this as a great triumph.” “David Cameron is caught. He goes to Brussels and gets chickenfeed – that won’t satisfy the eurosceptics. He goes there and argues for something more than chickenfeed and his bluff is called.” • An eight-page briefing from Open Europe on the prospects of Anglo-German agreement on EU reform (pdf). Germany remains the most important ‘swing state’ in the debate about the EU’s future, and the outline of an Anglo-German bargain on EU reform is emerging. Angela Merkel’s CDU party is expected to argue in its European election manifesto that it should be possible for EU powers to return to national governments, and Germany and the UK are already among the most vocal advocates of reforming rules on EU migrants’ access to state welfare. Crucially, Germany’s desire to put further Eurozone integration on a sounder constitutional footing and enforce economic supervision on other Eurozone economies could also present David Cameron with his best chance of securing an EU Treaty change. Germany has already shown itself to be sympathetic to UK concerns about the Eurozone writing the rules for all member states. However, the presence of the SPD in Germany’s Grand Coalition has made matters more complicated and potentially limits how far Chancellor Merkel is able to go. This makes it all the more important that the UK wins support for its reform agenda in as many like-minded countries as possible, allowing Merkel the cover she needs to back it. There remains no guarantee that an EU Treaty change will coincide with Cameron’s 2017 referendum timetable but while this would be a blow, much reform can nevertheless be achieved without it. • The Financial Times says Merkel will not be offering Cameron major concessions over EU reform. “Anyone who expects a thunderbolt will be disappointed,” said one person familiar with Ms Merkel’s thinking. That is not to say that Ms Merkel and her team are not thinking of ways to help Mr Cameron: indeed the chancellor will stress her determination to keep the UK in Europe as a free-trading, liberal ally. But now is not the time. As Mr Cameron’s team admit, why would Ms Merkel show her cards now when it is uncertain if he will still be in power after May 2015? • Fraser Nelson in the Spectator says David Cameron may have the allies he needs to reshape Europe. What might Cameron want then? He has yet to say, which makes it difficult for the Germans to support him. This is where Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, comes in. Cameron has known him for years, and once bent the Commons’ rules by giving him lunch in a dining room reserved for MPs. For an enthusiastic Anglophile like Rutte, such gestures are much appreciated. He was in Britain again last week, invited to Chequers for talks and dinner. The two leaders have much to talk about (besides floods) — both are moderates in their mid forties, leading coalitions and implementing austerity at home. Both are facing challenges from Eurosceptic populists: Nigel Farage in Britain, and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands. Both want radical reform to the European Union, but Rutte has a hard plan — one that could easily double as a Cameron manifesto. He wants to put Brussels back in its box, giving national parliaments the power to veto EU directives they don’t like. If more than a third of member states dislike an EU idea, he says, it should bite the dust. He also plans a new manifesto for the EU: it should stop spewing out directives, and act only when national parliaments cannot. Less interference, less spending, fewer diktats, more democracy. Precisely the sort of package that Cameron would like to offer in a referendum — albeit with a British stamp on it. • Rafael Behr in the New Statesman says Cameron is a good European in private. But the PM cannot play the good European in private and the gun-slinging sceptic in public for much longer. It is weak diplomacy and self-defeating politics. Britain doesn’t want to lose strategic influence in Europe and for the foreseeable future, the EU is the club where mid-sized European democracies agglomerate into a global power. Angela Merkel knows it. Vladimir Putin knows it. A penniless mob of angry Ukrainians knows it. David Cameron knows it too: he just hopes to get through an election campaign without being forced to say it out loud. • James Kirkup in the Daily Telegraph says there is a rich historical background to today’s Merkel/Cameron meeting. Anglo-German meetings are often discussed in historical terms: the 20th Century offers awful memories of conflict, and the centenary of the Great War’s beginning falls this year. Next year, we have the bicentenary of Waterloo, when a Prussian’s late arrival on the battlefield clinched British victory over the French. No doubt Mr Cameron’s enthusiastic boosters would like to cast him as Wellington to Mrs Merkel’s Blucher. But here’s an anniversary that’s been overlooked: almost exactly 300 years ago, Britain was mourning Queen Anne, who passed without a Protestant heir. Thanks to the Act of Settlement, that meant the country had to go abroad for a successor. And where did we find our new ruler? A sleepy little place called Hanover, who gave us a string of kings called George and William IV – whose living descendants, incidentally, include one David Cameron. Remember this history as Mr Cameron bends over backwards tomorrow to secure Mrs Merkel’s backing. Three centuries on, Britain’s future is once again dependent on German leadership. She’s arrived. The Conservative MP Mark Pritchard found an interesting way to raise Angela Merkel during business questions in the Commons just now. Angela Merkel is on her way. I will be covering her speech in as much detail as I can, from TV and from reports from colleagues, but I will not be in the Royal Gallery because I could not get a seat. (Space is limited, and there is only one seat per news organisation.) And the Germans will not be issuing a text in advance. We do things rather differently, a spokesman at the embassy said, when I asked about getting hold of an embargoed text. The official text will not be released until this afternoon. Nick Clegg gave a round of interviews this morning to highlight the proposals in his speech on opportunities for young people. As often happens, he ended up talking more about topical questions than about the subject of his speech. But it contains some sensible proposals that merit some coverage. Here is a summary of the main points Clegg has been making in his speech, his interviews and his phone-in. • Clegg said that the government was considering holding a judicial inquiry into the way letters have been sent to IRA fugitives like John Downey telling them they would not face prosecution. He also said that it was a mistake not to be more open about this process with Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland’s first minister. (See 8.50am.) In his LBC phone-in Clegg said the government was considering a judicial review, but I think Clegg (Nick Ferrari, who asked the question) meant judicial inquiry, not judicial review. (See 9.20am.) It is hard to see how the government could judicial review itself. • Clegg announced three pilots designed to help young people get into work. They are: allowing job centres to help 16 and 17-year-olds apply for jobs, instead of just over-18s as now (being piloted in Lewisham); requiring 18 to 21-year-old job seekers without basic maths and English skills to learn these skills if they want to carry on claiming benefit (being piloted in Kent, Mercia, Somerset and Devon and Cornwall); and ensuring that 18 to 21-year-olds have access to work experience after six months on the dole (being piloted in Kent). Clegg said that if these ideas worked, they would be rolled out nationally. • He said that new guidance being issued to school would make them improve the quality of their career advice, and oblige them to develop close links with employers. Summarising both initiatives, Clegg said: So, imagine: if you’re a young person who has felt that you can’t get the careers advice and guidance you need to figure out what you want to do next, you’ll now get it. If you’re a young person who can’t get the same quality of information and support to make your choices as your friends who want to go to university, you’ll now get it. And if you’re a young person who can’t find the help you need to get a job, we want to ensure you can get it through Jobcentre Plus. That includes making sure you have the essential skills for work. Together, these changes will help us simplify your choices, end the snobbery surrounding vocational education that limits your prospects and support you as you make these decisions. • He said RBS should limiting the size of bonuses it pays to its staff. A loss-making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses ... It’s important that RBS understands that it’s in a different category to other banks because other banks that are self-standing banks ... In RBS’ case it’s different. Of course there will be bonuses but it is really important those bonuses are as restrained and limited as possible. Here is more from the Office for National Statistics report on migration explaining why net migration is going up. The changes to net migration ... have been caused by changes in immigration and emigration. In some years, net migration increased as a result of increased immigration (for example, in 2004/05) and in other years it has increased because emigration has fallen (for example in 2007). Latest figures for the year ending September 2013 show that immigration has increased slightly (although not a statistically significant change) by 35,000 to 532,000 from 497,000 during the previous year. Additionally, emigration has fallen slightly (although again not a statistically significant change) from 343,000 to 320,000. The combined increase in immigration and decrease in emigration has resulted in a statistically significant increase in net migration to 212,000 from 154,000. Recent patterns in total net migration have been affected by different changes in migration flows between EU citizens and non-EU citizens. Net migration of EU citizens doubled from 65,000 in the year ending September 2012 to 131,000 in the year ending September 2013, a statistically significant increase. Conversely, the estimate of net migration of non-EU citizens has declined over the last few years. Although the recent fall to 141,000 in the year ending September 2013 from 160,000 in the previous year was not a statistically significant change, non-EU net migration remains at a lower level relative to the 2005 and 2010 peaks. There has been a sharp in increase in immigration. The Press Association has just snapped this. There was a net flow of 212,000 long-term migrants to the UK in the year ending September 2013, an increase from 154,000 in the previous year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Here is the ONS news release. And here is the statistical bulletin, with the full details (pdf). The Conservatives, of course, want to get net migration down, to below 100,000. Q: What will you be saying to Angela Merkel? Clegg says the key challenge is to improve the competitiveness of Europe. Q: She looks a bit dour. Is she fun? Clegg says she is good company. She is really keen on football. Q: Do you regret missing out on the ski holiday that Vince Cable and Lord Oakeshott had together? Were they plotting to get rid of you? Clegg says that he was spending the half term with his children instead. He does not think they were plotting to get rid of him. Q: The Sun says you have buried a report about the failure of the Youth Contract. Is that right? No, says Clegg. He says he has published figures about the success of the Youth Contract. One aspect of it has been disappointing, but the work experience part of it has been very successful. He says he will be making a speech later about his proposals to improve options for children not going to university. Q: How can RBS pay £600m in bonuses when it has lost £8bn? Clegg says you cannot end all bonuses. They are part of the way that industry operates. But they should be going down. Q: But should any bonuses be paid? The bank is losing money. Clegg says experts say that the way renumeration works in banking includes bonuses. But the way bonuses are paid has been reformed. The bonus pool at RBS has already come down 15%. Q: Do you accept that black people are still suffering discrimination? Clegg says progress has been made, but more needs to be done. That is one of the reasons Theresa May is addressing the stop and search rules. Clegg says the government cannot say anything to placate the distress that the relatives of victims must feel about the collapse of the trial of John Downey. Q: Peter Robinson says he might resign tonight? That’s why we are urgently looking at what he is demanding, says Clegg. An urgent review is being carried out into the issuing of these letters, he says. He says the Lib Dems were one of the parties that opposed the idea of an amnesty for these IRA fugitives. Q: What do you think about a judicial review? Clegg says he, David Cameron and others are looking at this. They want to do the right thing. They are looking at the case for a judicial review, he says. There should have been a more open discussion about this, he says. Q: When were you first aware of this? Some months ago, says Clegg. Q: Did you recoil with shock and horror? No, says Clegg. These arrangements, agreed by the previous government, brought unprecedented peace to Northern Ireland. That should not be discarded. But in the case of John Downey, a dreadful mistake was made, Clegg says. UPDATE AT 10.30AM: Nick Ferrari asked Clegg about a judicial review, and Clegg said it was being considered, but I think what he meant was judicial inquiry. Q: You have given £10m to the Somerset flood buildings. You have given £15m to repair coastal flood defences. But you are giving £500m to Ukraine. How can you justify this? Clegg says helping Ukraine is in our self interest, for our security. Having millions and millions of increasingly impoverished Ukrainians living in an unstable country is not in Britain’s interest. Q: What would we feel if the Russian gave £500m to help the Scots? Clegg says that is not the same. Ukraine is a large country, in a strategically important location. Q: So you are happy to give this money, but not to fix the rail line at Dawlish? Clegg says that if the caller thinks that not giving money to Ukraine will enable Network Rail to fix the line at Dawlish more quickly, he is on a different planet. Q: There are reports that Russian jets are now on alert on the border with Ukraine. What’s your reaction? Clegg says he has not seen these reports. But these developments are very worrying. Q: In the light of the Harman/NCCL/PIE affair, why can’t the liberal left be more open about its problems in the past? Clegg says he was a young boy at the time. He was 11 when Harriet Harman became a legal officer at NCCL in 1978. He finds it “incomprehensible” that the NCCL had any links with with this organisation. Shami Chakrabarti, the Liberty director, has apologised on behalf of the organisation for this. But it is up to Harman to decide what she says, Clegg says. Q: Shouldn’t Harman just say sorry? Clegg says he is not her spokesperson. She has said that affiliating with PIE was not her decision, but it is up to her to address this. Q: If Harman and Jack Dromey were in the Lib Dems, would you conduct an investigation into their involvement? Clegg says people should take responsibility. But Harman has said she was not personally responsible for this, he says. Nick Clegg has already done a round of interviews this morning, ahead of the speech he is giving on opportunities for young people. Now he is doing his regular LBC phone-in. David Cameron is rolling out the red carpet today for the German chancellor Angela Merkel. She is addressing MPs and peers, having a working lunch with Cameron at Number 10 and holding a press conference (as well as meeting the Queen and Ed Miliband), and her visit will be the focus of the day. Here’s the Guardian’s preview story. But there is plenty of other news around today. Here are two stories that have broken this morning. • Standard Life has said that it could move some of its operations out of Scotland if Scotland were to go independent without a currency union with the rest of the UK. • Nick Clegg has said that the government is considering holding an inquiry into the letters issued to IRA fugitives telling them they were not facing legal action. In an interview, Clegg also said that it was a mistake not to keep Peter Robinson, the Northern Ireland first minister, informed of this process. We are looking urgently at what Peter Robinson has said and demanded. We are doing a very quick review of all the other letters in existence. We are urgently considering his view that there should be a full inquiry. We don’t want this to escalate into a full-blown political crisis in Northern Ireland, however much we totally understand the strength of feeling around this, and that’s why during the course of the day we will of course seek to respond to a lot of the very strongly held views expressed by Peter Robinson and others ... Clearly with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been much better to have an open discussion at an earlier stage with Peter Robinson and his administration on this legacy system that had been set up many years ago by the previous Labour government. Here’s the full agenda for the day. 9am: Nick Clegg hosts his Call Clegg phone-in. 9.30am: Immigration figures are released. 10am: Clegg gives a speech on government support for young people. 11am: Michael Fallon, the energy minister, speaks at a nuclear power conference. Around 11.30am: MPs begin a backbench debate on the effects of welfare reform on sick and disabled people. 12pm: Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, addresses MPs and peers in the Royal Gallery in the House of Lords. Lunchtime: The Department for Work and Pensions publishes the consultation on its child poverty strategy 2.35pm: Merkel and David Cameron hold a press conference following their lunchtime meeting in Downing Street. I plan to focus today on the Merkel visit. But, as usual, I will also be flagging up any breaking political news, posting summaries with a round-up of all the day’s developments, and highlighting the most interesting political articles on the web.

In early April, we witnessed in West Virginia the worst coal-mining disaster in 40 years; it left 29 miners dead. Just weeks later, in Western Kentucky two coal miners perished when a major structural element collapsed, burying them. And then, following an explosion at a massive oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, 11 died, and the leaking oil threatens a regional economic and environmental catastrophe of epic proportions, possibly even greater than that associated with the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster which contaminated nearly 200 miles of Alaskan shoreline. Coal and oil regularly pose risks to human life and the environment, but we tolerate them because they are the only reliable, vast-scale choices for our energy-hungry country, right? Wrong. Nuclear power – energy released from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions – is a safer, more environmentally friendly source of electricity. Simply put, nuclear power is \"clean\". No pollutants or greenhouse gasses, no impact on respiratory health, no connection with other adverse human health effects. So why are we still relying on coal and oil instead of nuclear? There are at least three reasons: groundless fears, technological ignorance and political correctness. Anti-nuclear activists, still living in the dark days of A-bomb fears and radioactive fallout polluting the atmosphere, and harbouring a New Age preference for more \"natural\" – but currently inadequate – sources of energy such as wind and solar, promulgate scary scenarios about nuclear energy plants leaking radioactivity in amounts sufficient to harm or kill people in surrounding areas. Such fears often are based on a series of worst-case scenarios and the assumption that any amount of radioactivity is inherently dangerous. And, of course, critics of nuclear energy regularly raise anxieties about the fate of nuclear waste. That is a legitimate concern now that the Obama administration intends to abandon development of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, where the United States had been planning since 1987 to store its nuclear waste. Most of the sceptics are woefully ignorant of the facts. For example, although many know (but discount) the fact that some European countries satisfy most of their energy needs with nuclear power, few have any idea that the United States produces the most energy, in terms of actual megawatts, from nuclear. Other countries, such as France, obtain a larger fraction of their energy than we do, but the United States leads in actual output. Our 50-plus years of experience with nuclear power demonstrates that even releases of low levels of radiation are highly unlikely (and in any case there is no evidence that low-level radiation exposure is harmful). In the much-touted accident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island reactor in 1979, even though part of the nuclear fuel melted, virtually all the radioactivity from the fuel rods was retained within the reactor building itself. The containment system worked: very little radiation was released to the external environment. The population in the surrounding area received negligible radiation exposure in excess of the amount normally received from natural background. The death toll was zero and the public health impact, nil. In another widely cited incident in 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in the Ukraine exploded due to errors made by the operators during an unauthorised test while the reactor was operating. Unlike western reactors, the Chernobyl design did not have a robust containment structure or redundant safety elements. As a result, highly irradiated fuel and much of the reactor's radioactivity were released into the surrounding environment. The nearby population was evacuated. (It is important to note that the Chernobyl plant was old and even then obsolete, lacking safety features that are now standard at modern nuclear power plants). What about the handling and storage of waste? Because of the enormous amount of energy released by nuclear fission, the amount of used fuel is relatively small in volume. After storage underwater for several years, it is packaged in very heavy sealed containers made of steel and reinforced concrete which can be stored for centuries and does not allow radioactivity to escape to the external environment. Sweden, Finland and France have plans for final underground repositories to be in place by 2030. Nuclear power is a clean, safe source of power that already generates nearly 20% of US electricity, proven over half a century in fixed plants and ships, and several European countries rely on nuclear energy as their primary source of power. Its major problem is more than three decades of relative neglect of American R&amp;D and use. For reasons of national economic and political security, as well as for public and occupational safety, we need to be guided by facts, not fears. We need to begin a major US expansion of nuclear power. • This article was co-authored by Dr Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/the-northerner/2011/aug/03/sellafield-mox-cumbria-seker-marchon-kangol-whitehaven-egremont-cleator-moor-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-03T17:00:20Z","webTitle":"West Cumbria needs a wider industrial base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/aug/03/sellafield-mox-cumbria-seker-marchon-kangol-whitehaven-egremont-cleator-moor-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/aug/03/sellafield-mox-cumbria-seker-marchon-kangol-whitehaven-egremont-cleator-moor-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"West Cumbria needs a wider industrial base","bodyText":"Cumbria has taken another hefty punch with the closure of Sellafield's Mox (mixed oxide) plant. The news comes while the county still copes with the long-term aftermath of November 2009's floods and the psychological fallout from Derek Bird's murderous last day. Reaction from local official bodies centres on a demand for a proposed new and more modern reprocessing centre to be confirmed and built; but others want more clout given to promoting the county's western side as an ideal place to site new and different business. This happened in and just after the greater depression of the 1930s when three new companies were brought to the area, all by refugees from the Nazis in Europe. There was Seker's silk at Whitehaven, the Marchon detergent factory in the same town and Kangol (silK,ANGora,woOL) making first berets and then seatbelts in Egremont, Cleator and other stops on the long, winding Irish Sea coast. They used the existing skills made redundant by coal, ironworks and engineering. Today, West Cumbria has a still more highly-trained workforce and the added attraction of fabulous countryside on its doorstep and relatively cheap housing – the spiralling prices of the Lake District have not yet crept this far. Those who doubt the wisdom of dependence on nuclear power are keen to promote this; but in the meanwhile, the calls for 'new Mox' will be loud and persuasive. Cumbria county council's Labour leader Eddie Martin says: The Government must surely step in to ensure that nuclear skills and jobs are retained in West Cumbria for the longer term future of the industry and for the regeneration of Cumbria as a whole. The most effective way of doing this is for the Government to immediately confirm it will commission and build a new Sellafield Mox plant that will serve modern needs, as soon as possible, not least because other countries, such as Russia, are building Mox plants and the commercial opportunities may well bypass us if we are not quick off the mark. The need for reprocessing is never going to go away. Nuclear energy is still a global solution, despite the Fukushima crisis. Tim Knowles, the council's Cabinet member responsible for nuclear issues, echoes his leader What we now need from Government is an immediate and clear commitment to invest in a new generation of Mox plant at Sellafield so that we can deal with the UK's plutonium stockpile and produce a fuel that will contribute to low carbon energy generation. Sellafield's Mox workforce need to know that they have a future on the Sellafield site, otherwise we risk losing their skills. We always expected this Mox plant to be decommissioned, but our expectation and hope was that it would happen after a new Mox plant was installed. The Government is working on a massive programme around nuclear energy for the 21st Century and Cumbria is an integral part of that programme. What we can't have is a situation where jobs disappear and nuclear skills leak out of the region because of the Mox closure. A new plant would dramatically reverse today's gloom, providing some 5,000 construction jobs as well as the permanent staff once work began. The closure means the loss of 600 jobs at Sellafield with probable knock-on effects on 1000 others at service and supply firms. Can nuclear opponents come up with comparable job-providing alternatives?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2012/mar/05/nfl-bounty-new-orleans-saints-brett-favre","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-05T16:23:00Z","webTitle":"New Orleans Saints bounty is just a part of the game | Patrick Hruby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/05/nfl-bounty-new-orleans-saints-brett-favre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/05/nfl-bounty-new-orleans-saints-brett-favre","fields":{"headline":"New Orleans Saints bounty is just a part of the game","bodyText":"National Football League players are being paid good money to maim each other. Which apparently is news. A moral crisis, even. Not because said players are receiving official league paychecks to, you know, maim each other, but rather because the maiming in question is intentional, and also being funded by the rough equivalent of an informal office bonus pool. Note: the last part is totally, totally scandalous. Confused? Nostrils tickled by a faint whiff of rank hypocrisy, emanating from the spectacle of violent men being reprimanded for violent deeds in the context of a violent game? Follow along. Last week, the NFL announced that the New Orleans Saints violated league rules by running a multi-season bounty program, run by former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, in which defenders paid into a kitty and received cash rewards for injuring opposing players: $1,000 if an opponent was carted off the field; $1,500 if he was knocked out of the game altogether; amounts doubling and tripling in the playoffs. Before the 2009 NFC title game, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma reportedly threw $10,000 on a table and promised it to anyone who took out Minnesota's Brett Favre. Perhaps unsurprisingly, New Orleans defenders went on to mercilessly batter the Vikings quarterback, registering a vicious high-low hit as Favre threw a decisive late-game interception. Moreover, Williams reportedly ran similar programs – what he charmingly dubbed \"pay for performance,\" as if his defenders were used car salesmen receiving steakhouse gift cards for hitting their monthly sales targets, as opposed to hitting the likes of Favre and retired quarterback Kurt Warner – with the Washington Redskins and Buffalo Bills. For its part, the NFL is not amused. According to multiple reports, league commissioner Roger Goodell is expected to slap the Saints with a more severe punishment than the fines and forfeited draft picks levied upon the New England Patriots for videotaping their opponents' coaching signals in the 2007 SpyGate scandal. In other words: in professional football, it's bad to cheat. But it's far worse to accept tips for doing your job. Particularly for doing it well. In fact, that's why Goodell has to crack down. Here's the thing about football: it's a hurting profession, a fundamentally vicious game. Always has been. In 1905, a University of Chicago professor called it a \"boy-killing, man-mutilating, money-making, education-prostituting, gladiatorial sport\" – and that was nearly a century before anyone had heard of the mind-mincing, brain trauma-induced disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Still, we accept the carnage, the crushing blows and kill shots, the pregame needles of Toradol and the subsequent damage done. More to the point, we enjoy the mayhem, thrilling to every collision. The hitting is the action is the juice. And a big part of our pleasure – how we rationalize and justify our collective, bloodthirsty id – comes from placing pro football into a particular, peculiar context. From looking at the sport not as glorified human cockfighting – like, say, boxing – but as something more honorable and benign. Something akin to arm wrestling. Arm wrestling revolves around physical domination. Participants inflict and endure pain and suffering. They even get injured, sometimes severely. That said, they don't mean to harm each other. There's no malice, no vicious intent. Harm isn't the point of the exercise; it's simply an inevitable, unfortunate outcome, like the radioactive waste produced from a nuclear power plant. Come Sundays, we tell ourselves the same thing every time a football player is carted off the field. When I first heard about the Saints bounty story, I reached out to David Meggyesy. A former NFL linebacker, Meggyesy also is something of a football hippie, a freethinking longtime union organizer who has written critically about the dehumanizing aspects of the sport and its culture. I figured he would blast the league's hypocrisy for preparing to penalize the Saints; instead, he echoed the above. \"When I played it was not so much inflicting pain or injury as it was making a good play to effect the outcome of the game,\" Meggyesy said. \"A good hard tackle was part of the game and a joyful part of the game. If I did injure someone, I was not pleased and did not want to see it happen – but recognized it was part of the game itself. It could be said the game is hard enough, violent enough without bounties being given to injure and maim your opponent.\" Sounds reasonable. Except for one thing: physical harm being part of the game itself. That's where the problem lies, the fundamental contradiction at the heart of football's appeal, the dirty little secret no one wants to acknowledge. When a sport is inherently brutal – when the harm is baked in, when the point of the game is to move and/or retard the advance of the ball by knocking someone on their ass, hard, and when participants are rewarded for their skill and courage in doing so – then the whole honorable notion of not meaning to hurt someone becomes arbitrary, more or less irrelevant, fullbacks dancing on the head of a pin. Former NFL player and scout Bucky Brooks wrote on the league's website that when he was with the Kansas City Chiefs, players routinely were given framed pictures of their biggest hits during team meetings. Income tax considerations aside, this is fundamentally different than cash bounties … how? Suppose I'm a Saints linebacker. Suppose you're an opposing quarterback. I'm trying to sack you so hard that you fumble the ball – giving my team a better chance to win, and upping my contract renegotiation leverage in the process. Maybe I'm not trying to concuss you. No matter. Chances are good that I'll end up doing so, either by whiplashing your neck or slamming your head into the turf. What's the more likely result of a \"good, hard tackle\" – broken ribs, or an impromptu ice cream social? The hitting is the action is the juice. Players know this. And frankly, a lot of them are trying to hurt each other. Dave Pear, a former All-Pro defensive lineman who won a Super Bowl with the Oakland Raiders, told me that bounties on particular offensive players were commonplace in the 1970s. Atlanta receiver Roddy White and Buffalo linebacker Shawne Merriman are among more than a half-dozen current players who say the same practice remains commonplace today. Dan Daly, a football historian and longtime writer for the Washington Times, told me that bounties go back to the 1950s – the only real difference is that old school players threw $5 to $10 in the kitty, as opposed to thousands of dollars. \"It's a fundamental part of the NFL's culture that isn't talked about outside of team facilities,\" wrote former NFL safety Matt Bowen – who played under Williams in Washington – in the Chicago Tribune. \"I'm not saying it's right. Or ethical. But the NFL isn't little league football with neighborhood dads playing head coach. This is the business of winning. If that means stepping over some line, you do it.\" This is real reason BountyGate qualifies as a scandal, and why the league has to come down hard on New Orleans: not because the team crossed a line, but because they offered a peek at the battered men and human heat-seeking missiles behind the curtain. Whether you're earning an above-board paycheck or an off-the-books bonus, trying to injure or just trying to make a good, hard tackle, the unsettling truth is this: someone's getting hurt. There is no line. There's simply the one we draw in our heads, the one that makes the NFL as enjoyable as action movies and \"Madden\" and other televised diversions in which actual people aren't actually damaged. The hypocrisy here isn't coming from the league. But don't take my word for it. Ask Favre. Contacted by Sports Illustrated's Peter King, the retired quarterback was asked about the beating he took against the Saints. \"I'm not pissed,\" he said. \"It's football. I don't think anything less of those guys.\" Favre was right. That's football. It ain't arm wrestling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/15/climate-changes-for-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-15T20:59:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: Climate changes for renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/15/climate-changes-for-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/15/climate-changes-for-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Climate changes for renewable energy","bodyText":"In recent weeks there has been a strong and well-organised media campaign constantly arguing that large increases in gas and electricity bills are almost entirely due to \"green taxes\" for the development of renewable energy. So I am pleased to hear the Committee on Climate Change confirm that this is a huge red herring (Annual energy bills 'to rise by £190 by 2020', 15 December). I believe this co-ordinated campaign has been orchestrated by those interests who seem to be determined to stop the positive, clean, sustainable and huge economic potential that exists with developing renewable forms of energy. The parallel benefit of promoting energy efficiency should be welcomed in reducing the alarming rise in fuel poverty, and it will directly help to cut fuel bills. It is interesting therefore to read on the Guardian's website (Environment blog, 14 December) a Sunday Times YouGov poll, hardly reported by the Sunday Times, that shows strong support for renewables over nuclear and fossil fuels. The poll shows huge support for developing more solar power (74%), just when government has cut the popular feed-in tariffs (FITs), and strong support for more wind power (56%). This compares to support for new nuclear at just 35%, with a majority 50% wanting to see either no more nuclear power stations or a total phase-out. Oil and coal come out even less favourably. Why do we not hear about such figures across the UK media? The government should look at them, and start amending its energy policies accordingly. Councillor Brian Goodall Chair, Nuclear Free Local Authorities • 12 December 2011 was a dark day for Britain – the day Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, slashed solar subsidies, while proclaiming what a good result Britain had achieved at the climate change conference in Durban. Huhne claims the cost of solar panels has halved, and that therefore the subsidy (FIT) should be halved. But solar panels are only half the cost of installation, so even if panel prices have halved, which is doubtful, the total cost of investment has reduced by only a quarter. Huhne also claimed the original FIT of 43.3p per kilowatt generated was too generous. Not so! The rate of return over 25 years, including the cost of the original investment, is a reasonable 6%. Who will take investment risks when the effective rate of return is 3%? Huhne's decision to bring the tariff change forward by nearly four months has thrown personal investment plans into disarray, and created mistrust of the government's intentions, not only for solar but also wind applications. The fact is, we need solar energy now to meet our Kyoto obligations. Huhne has betrayed the green agenda. John Urquhart Newcastle upon Tyne • So the wealthy people fortunate enough to be in a position to splash out in excess of £10,000 and enjoy the huge benefits of solar panel installation are now up in arms about the government rethink of tariffs. Spare a thought for the millions of poor people who will continue in fuel poverty without a hope of ever being able to afford these benefits. It is another example of the growing economic divide: similarly those wealthy enough to enjoy a new car have little or no road tax due to emission regulations, while poorer people who have to run old cars pay the full amount of tax. G Randall Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire • If you rely on Murdoch sources, Australia's \"carbon tax\" may well \"look like a trip to the moral high ground at the expense of international competitiveness\" (Editorial, 13 December). But in fact the policy is quite gradualist: trade-exposed emitters receive a 94% discount for the foreseeable future, and eventually polluters will be able to buy foreign carbon credits if that's cheaper than cleaning up domestically. Rather than aiming for a big bang reduction in emissions, the point of the policy is to build supply lines for low-carbon technologies. This is a prudent goal. Whether due to rising temperatures or rising exports to Asia, it is unlikely that in 20 years' time Australia will be able to justify burning coal to power domestic air conditioners. Adrian Pellas-Rice Whipstick, Victoria, Australia • Your leader doesn't give credit for a scheme that is likely inform the roadmap towards a global agreement on emissions reduction. The carbon tax is a four-year transition measure leading to an emissions trading scheme, so it fits with any future settlement on climate. Australian farmers have begun to move towards carbon-sequestering farming, including green manures, biochar and other techniques that will restore soil carbon and reverse the damaging deforestation, soil degradation and consequent greenhouse gas emissions of the past century. These \"carbon farming\" credits will be bought at a minimum floor price of A$23 per tonne by carbon-emitting industry. This makes far more sense than the EU system of issuing excessive emissions permits to industry while subsidising agricultural practices that increase CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions. Australia's carbon tax is the first emissions reduction system that doesn't pick winners and losers, and so is free of political dictates. As such, it will stimulate investment in genuine climate mitigation efforts. Craig Sams Executive chairman, Carbon Gold • Michael Jacobs says \"only … investment in low carbon technologies and other emission-reducing activities\" will cut greenhouse gas emissions (Hope at last in Durban, 12 December). But such technologies have not helped so far, and are unlikely to in future. This is due to the Jevons paradox – energy efficiency cuts costs, and so increases consumption – and the fact that possible savings are dwarfed by growth in energy consumption in countries such as China and India. There is no realistic prospect of valuable fossil fuels being left in the ground, so the best strategy for tackling climate change is to mitigate the damage caused by their burning. We need to invest in carbon capture and storage, and geoengineering.

The changes include a transformation of the nation's draughty homes and cuts in how far people commute to work, as well as a vast expansion of wind and solar power and dozens of new nuclear or \"clean coal\" power plants. The authors of the Royal Academy of Engineering report, published today , say the existing level of political will and the market-led approach to energy planning cannot deliver the fundamental restructuring needed. \"We are nowhere near having a plan,\" said Prof Sue Ion, who led the report. \"These are massive projects. It requires a huge exercise all through government, and needs to come from the very top and go down through all departments such as transport and local government.\" \"What we are talking about is making sure our children and grandchildren have an energy infrastructure that is fit for purpose.\" Another author, Prof Roger Kemp, from Lancaster University, said: \"It needs the political enthusiasm that was behind the war on terror after 9/11.\" The team devised scenarios for the UK in 2050, starting with achievable cuts in energy usage and the maximum possible amount of renewable energy. Next they calculated how much fossil fuel could then be used while still meeting the UK's planned action on climate change, an 80% cut in carbon emissions by 2050. In all scenarios, that left an energy gap that was filled by dozens of new nuclear power stations and coal stations fitted with technology to prevent carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. In the two scenarios identified by the engineers as most probable, fossil fuel use fell by 75%, renewable energy rose 20-fold and about 40 new nuclear or clean coal plants were needed (see details below). The remaining fossil fuel has to be split between heating homes or powering transport, with social consequences for both. If home heating is to be decarbonised by the use of electric heat pumps, said the authors, gas boilers would have to be all but banned and community heating schemes built. If cars are to be electrified, then a vast new charging infrastructure is needed, said Kemp, including a smart, interactive grid that charges vehicles when renewable energy from wind and the sun is most available. Kemp suggested the long commutes to work common today could not continue: \"We have to think about constraints on where we live. Car mileage has been going up since 1950s and shows no sign of slowing.\" But he said: \"One of the problems of transport is that it is a very emotional issue.\" A critical factor was cutting demand for energy, said the author Prof Roland Clift, from the University of Surrey, primarily by increasing the energy efficiency of homes. \"The UK has notoriously inefficient buildings. We need to put huge effort into the unsexy business of retrofitting. It is a frustration to me that this was said 10 years ago, but very little has happened since.\" The transformation needed is so substantial that they said it would \"inevitably involve significant rises in energy costs to end users\"' said Ion. But the report notes that the renewal of the UK's energy infrastructure, mostly built in the 1970s, is required regardless of the need to cut emissions to tackle global warming. Prof Nick Cumsty used another war analogy: \"It's like going to war with Hitler: it is not what it costs but what you have to do or you will be overwhelmed.\" In October, the government's adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, said a \"step change\" was needed in the rate of carbon emissions cuts. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"Large parts of the report are very much in tune with our thinking.\" Last month, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said in a statement: \"For the longer term [beyond 2020], Britain will need a more interventionist energy policy. The scale and upfront nature of the low-carbon investment needed is likely to require significant reform of our market arrangements.\" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \"The government has been too slow and too hesitant in the past, but next week's budget offers them a chance to fire the starting gun for a low-carbon economy. Britain has faced up to massive challenges before and has emerged stronger and more prosperous because of them. The decades ahead will improve our energy security and generate thousands of new jobs.\" What the UK needs in 2050 to keep the lights on and fight global warming Renewable energy: • More than 20,000 wind turbines, on and off onshore • 36m² of solar panels on each house, or equivalent • 1,000 miles of Pelamis \"sea-snake\" wave power machines • A tidal power barrage across the Severn and 2,300 tidal turbines elsewhere • The burning of farm, forest and food waste for electricity, and transport biofuels, equivalent to 26 large coal-powered stations Low-carbon energy: • About 40 new power stations using either nuclear or \"clean coal\" technology Fossil fuels: • Use cut by 75% compared with today and used largely for transport or home heating, but not both Energy efficiency • 20% cut in energy use by white goods and gadgets, and a 40% cut in home heating"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/sep/15/greenpeace-40-year-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-15T06:15:00Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace at 40: A global brand in good health or an out-of-touch bureaucracy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/15/greenpeace-40-year-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/sep/15/greenpeace-40-year-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace at 40: A global brand in good health or an out-of-touch bureaucracy?","bodyText":"It began with a counter-culture movement of young journalists and Canadian ecologists calling themselves the Don't Make a Wave Committee. In one of the last century's more romantic acts, they hired a fishing boat with the modest intention of stopping an atomic bomb test in the Pacific and redefining man's relationship with the Earth. Forty tumultuous years later, including the sinking of its flagship and the murder of one of its activists by the French government, Greenpeace is a global brand with nearly 3 million members, turning over hundreds of millions of dollars a year and picking fights with almost everyone in power. On Thursday it announced it was planning to expand into developing countries but also warned that the battle against the \"mindless exploitation\" of Earth's resources was in danger of being lost. But the group that won't accept donations from corporations and has always offended governments and its proxies is being wished both a happy and a very unhappy middle age. \"It was very powerful. It had the passion. It was idealistic and courageous,\" says Paul Watson, membership no 007 and the youngest surviving co-founder who was expelled in 1977 for being too confrontational. Watson went on to found the rival Sea Shepherd organisation and famously call Greenpeace \"the Avon ladies of the environment movement\". \"Many of the first group were journalists. We called ourselves [Marshall] McLuhan's warriors. But it's become a big bureaucracy. It's not original any more. It should be concentrating on the issues it began with,\" said Watson this week. Rex Weyler, an American-Canadian journalist who sailed on the first boat to the Aleutian Islands, said: \"[Greenpeace] adopted a form of civil disobedience - it did for the environment what the civil rights movement did for the dispossessed. We wanted to launch an ecology movement. There were civil rights, women's and peace movements. What was lacking was a real sense of ecology. We set out not to create an international organisation and make Greenpeace famous. We were going to transform the world … it sort of worked, didn't it?\". Former Labour environment minister Michael Meacher said: \"My officials were dismayed and business was alarmed, but Greenpeace absolutely captured my imagination by their daring and dangerous escapades. Taking on the big forces of the world in such a scary way struck me rigid. [They] truly brought home what was going on.\" Former Conservative environment secretary John Gummer strongly supported the group today. \"Every environment minister should thank God for Greenpeace. It has helped us to push the boundaries much further than ever otherwise would have been possible.\" But Stewart Brand, author of the 1960s hippy bible the Whole Earth Catalog and now calling himself a \"futurist\", this week scorned the group he once admired. \"They have gone horribly wrong in opposing GM crops and nuclear power. In doing so they are obstructing progress where it is most needed – in the developing world – and making the greenhouse gas situation worse instead of better. In these matters their anti-science stance makes the whole green movement look irrational,\" he says. The group has also been attacked by scientists. \"Greenpeace is now a ratbag rabble of intellectual cowards intent on peddling an agenda, whatever the scientific evidence. Its former glory rested on the righteousness of its actions in support of real evidence of how humanity was failing to care for the environment. Now it is a sad, dogmatic, reactionary phalanx of anti-science zealots who care not for evidence, but for publicity,\" said Wilson da Silva, editor of Australian science magazine Cosmos. But Kumi Naidoo, the South African executive director of Greenpeace International, dismissed the criticism. He said the organisation is in good health, with offices in 40 countries, 3 million members and a growing presence and influence in China, Africa and Latin America. It will shortly launch a new 60-metre flagship Rainbow Warrior, one of the most environmentally advanced ships afloat. \"We've won many historic victories, on nuclear testing, whaling, protecting the rainforests, the hole in the ozone layer, defending the Antarctic and many other issues, the fact remains that the great environmental battle of our age [climate change] is still to be won,\" he said a statement on Thursday. • Read Kumi Nadoo's article in the Guardian"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/balfour-beatty-global-reach-carbon","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-26T10:00:00Z","webTitle":"Balfour Beatty - using its global reach to rethink carbon usage across schools, road and rail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/balfour-beatty-global-reach-carbon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/balfour-beatty-global-reach-carbon","fields":{"headline":"Balfour Beatty - using its global reach to rethink carbon usage across schools, road and rail","bodyText":"Balfour Beatty has three main aims in cutting carbon – helping customers cut their emissions, reducing its own footprint, and winning new work. This approach has led to a number of important firsts, including the first zero-carbon school in the US, and using nearly half a million recycled car tyres to build a major UK road. The construction group aims to cut its own greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020. More than 30 businesses – employing 50,000 people globally – report on their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. It is using a range of measures to hit this target. It has joined the WWF's One in Five campaign to reduce business air travel by 20% over five years. It uses energy efficient site accommodation, construction equipment and plants, green building certification on its estate and fuel efficient vehicle monitoring software. Balfour Beatty's energy forum is also exploring commercial low-carbon opportunities in offshore wind generation, carbon capture and storage, waste from energy facilities and nuclear power, and in developing the transmission network. Carbon efficient technology is helping the group's customers cut emissions too, from high-speed rail projects in Italy to street, road and school schemes across the world. For example, use of a new technology that automatically dims Coventry's street lights at off-peak times, will cut energy use by 38% over five years, saving 900 tonnes of carbon and £700,000 in costs. The group's civil engineers, calculating that 60-80% of the A421's carbon footprint was down to building materials, pioneered the first major use of old car tyres for lightweight structural fill. Using 400,000 recycled tyres, plus 375,000 tonnes of power station ash and 60% recycled aggregates, saved 50,000 tonnes of carbon. Meanwhile, the first zero-carbon school in Texas will generate all its own energy from non-fossil fuel sources – such as geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels and wind turbines – with surplus electricity sold back to the grid.

Other risks are not just theoretical; appalling consequences have already happened on a wide scale in the US. Fracking has been carried out in rural areas where people's off-grid water supplies have been made unusable by pollution. There have been cases where people cannot use water from the tap at the kitchen sink because methane comes with it, with the risk of explosions. Only half the chemical-laden water used in the process is recovered. It is then kept in lagoons on the surface where it is allowed to evaporate volatile toxic chemicals into the air. We cannot afford the risk to our water supplies. We don't have the open spaces which have been affected in the US. Even now we are faced with water restrictions and drought. We don't have the necessary huge quantities of water available to be used and made dirty for ever. The landscape would be dominated by well heads spread out over the whole gas field. It is likely that the air around these installations would be polluted by volatile toxic emissions. Come back wind turbines, all is forgiven. Marion Watson Sheffield • The Department of Energy and Climate Change report recommending that shale gas exploration be allowed to continue says nothing about water and air pollution, nor the consequences of shale on renewables and our efforts to tackle climate change. The UK is the richest country in Europe in renewable energy potential, but the new focus on gas threatens to displace investment in those renewables, making it even harder to achieve our targets and nurture this jobs-rich sector. A number of studies have shown the overall climate impact of shale gas to be as great as that of coal. If carbon capture and storage technology is not in place, burning just 20% of the gas which Cuadrilla claims to have found in its licence area in Lancashire would generate 15% of the UK's total CO2 allowance to 2050. And despite claims from gas lobbyists that shale gas will bring down energy bills, we know from Ofgem and DECC that recent energy bill rises resulted mainly from high gas prices. Analysis by Deutsche Bank concludes that the impact of shale on bills would actually be low. This report does not give the full picture, The government should reconsider its policy on shale gas so that we can make a genuinely green transition that will deliver both energy security and a cleaner environment. Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion • The fact that a scientific committee thinks earth tremors can be reduced by using the right equipment does not mean fracking to obtain shale gas is acceptable. Fracking results in atmospheric releases of methane twice that found with conventional gas. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, seven times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. For shale gas to be environmentally friendlier than other fossil fuels, methane emissions from fracking have to be kept below 2%. Current operations release around 10% and, in the US, the fossil fuel industry is strenuously resisting methane control legislation by the Environmental Protection Agency. Development of shale gas is impossible to reconcile with the low-carbon economy the planet so desperately needs. Dr Robin Russell-Jones International conference organiser, Help Rescue The Planet • I was pleased to see DECC experts have suggested we continue to explore the process of fracking. Meeting the current and future energy demands of the UK will require a mixed approach. Shale gas could prove extremely important. While we should not expect it to be a magic bullet, as part of a diverse energy strategy drawing on gas as well as renewable forms of energy, shale gas could help us increase energy security, lower fuel bills and thus reduce fuel poverty. Peter Styles and Brian Baptie, the authors of the DECC report, are correct in calling for a controlled return to fracking. It is not without its risks, but the only way we can ensure Britain can take advantage of new developments in the energy sector is to lead the way with approaches like this one. Professor Joe Howe Director, energy research and knowledge transfer, University of Central Lancashire • One of the most disquieting sentences in the fracking report said information on the chemicals involved in the process had been withheld \"for commercial reasons\". There are references (What's the truth about fracking?, G2, 18 April) to chemicals, and chemical lubricants (and to 75% of these remaining underground) but not to what the chemicals are. Part of the planning approval process for such extraction must include an environmental impact assessment – how can this be completed to the satisfaction of the public, or courts, if the nature of the chemicals involved is kept secret? How can public confidence be won if the companies say \"you do not need to know, just trust us\"? That trust does not exist, so Cuadrilla – what are you using? Martin Hemingway Leeds • Professor Kevin Anderson from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research says there is simply no room for shale gas if we are to achieve our climate change targets. The decision to go ahead with fracking is a symptom of a yet deadlier disease – a complete failure to realistically address the scale of what we need to do keep the global temperature increase within two degrees and prevent the catastrophic destabilisation of our global climate. Phil Thornhill Campaign against Climate Change • The government report on \"fracking\" makes it sound as safe, economic, and environmentally friendly as nuclear power. No worries there, then. Steven Thomson London • Where is the coherence in UK government energy policy? You have recently published three important energy policy articles that show the extensive confusion there is with the government's energy policy. Late last week you reported that the proposed \"green deal' for the promised renewable energy and energy efficiency revolution is under threat of being shelved (Report, 16 April). Then you reported (17 April) that the proposed new nuclear build utility for Sellafield, GDF Suez, is threatening to pull out of the project unless the government effectively gives it more price guarantees (at taxpayers' expense, I've no doubt). And finally you reported that the highly dubious and environmentally risky shale gas experiments will get the green light, despite, as you accurately report, scores of alarming issues like mini-earthquakes, water contamination and damaged natural landscapes. It doesn't make me feel confident that there is a coherent energy policy in the UK? What is clear to me is that the only safe, sustainable, clean, job-friendly and environmentally sound energy policy must be the development of a wide UK renewable energy mix, enhanced commitment to energy efficiency and microgeneration projects, coupled with international co-operation to create a European renewable super-grid (Report, 11 April). I urge the government to hold a strategic energy review as a matter of urgency and bring environmental common sense into its policy, rather than short-term economic expediency. Cllr Audrey Doig Vice-chair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities • Nigel Smith of the British Geological Survey is either very young or has an extremely short memory if he seriously believes that \"we have just had 30 years of getting our gas from the North Sea [and] it's not caused any problems to anyone\". The Elgin platform is still leaking gas, and threatening a major fire, after nearly four weeks, and is predicted to continue for several months, but at least no one has died. Earlier disasters entailed major loss of life. The pollution toll will not be known for some time. In 1988 Piper Alpha, in Norwegian waters but not much further from Scotland than the Elgin, exploded, causing 167 deaths. It was producing gas and oil. Earlier, the previous record-holder, the Alexander Kielland, simply turned over in 1980, killing 123. That was an oil rig, but the same fossil-fuel lessons hold. Previously, in the same Ekofisk field, a blowout in 1977 released some 120,000 barrels of oil. So, Mr Smith, perhaps it's time to look at genuine alternatives? Judith Martin Winchester, Hampshire • According to the University of Texas, fracking has caused some hundred earthquakes in the US. One, in Youngstown, was recorded at just over 4 on the Richter scale. However, the government-sponsored report on fracking is a diversion, it has simply looked at the geological implications. The important issues are: 1. Water. Around 2-3m gallons of water are used for each well, which can be fracked up to 18 times. In the US there are at least 35,000 wells, so a lot of water is used over there, and here, in the UK we are facing a water shortage. 2. Pollution. The United States house of representatives committee on energy in April 2011 reported 652 different chemicals used in fracking, 29 of which are human carcinogens. In addition, the New York Times (27 February, 2011) reported the presence of radium, unintentionally extracted in the process. Between 40% and 70% of the water used comes back to the surface and has to be disposed of. Then the US Environmental Protection Agency recently announced, for the first time, that fracking may cause groundwater pollution. 3. Climate change. Increasingly large amounts of energy will be required to extract shale gas – methane. Some 2-4% of this escapes from the well, and it is several dozen times more powerful a greenhouse gas than CO². Anyway, shale gas distracts from the real task which is to find effective renewable energy because, whether you accept climate change or not, we are going to run out of gas, oil, coal and even uranium one day soon. Fracking has been banned in Bulgaria, France, New York, New Jersey, Quebec and Switzerland, and in parts of Australia and South Africa. We need to consider the implications of the process before we allow powerful international companies to start drilling in the UK.

Recently battered sectors such as miners and insurance companies were in demand as investors searched for bargains among the wreckage, buoyed by talk of possible G7 intervention to stabilise the currency markets. With a similarly positive mood on Wall Street - up around 150 points by the time London closed despite slightly worse than expected US inflation and industrial production figures - the FTSE 100 finished 97.88 points higher at 5696.11. Base metals like copper, which had been hit by concerns that Japan's problems could hamper global economic growth, recovered some ground, benefitting the miners. So Antofagasta rose 55p to £13.47 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation closed 39p better at 899p. Xstrata added 49p to £13.78 as analysts pointed to the possible benefits for its coal production operations from any move away from nuclear power. Oil jumped more than $3 a barrel to nearly $114 on the continuing troubles in the middle east and Libya, lifting Royal Dutch Shell B shares 61.5p to 2111.5p Among the insurers, Aviva added 15.8p to 437p while Prudential, named by UBS as one of 20 stocks which had fallen too far in the wake of the Japanese earthquake, put on 16.5p to 690p. But Legal and General lost 0.4p to 110.7p as its full year figures disappointed, despite the company saying it was likely to benefit from the retrenchment of the welfare state. Elsewhere Kingfisher climbed 6.7p to 237.1p ahead of its results next week after German DIY group Hornbach, where it owns 21%, issued an upbeat trading statement. It said sales growth gained tempo from quarter to quarter, with consumers feeling positive about the outlook. Vodafone rose 4.35p to 171.45p following a well received open day for analysts on Wednesday. Steve Malcolm at Evolution Securities said: We attended presentations from the German, Italian, UK and Dutch management teams. Having endured some lean times, UK and Dutch operations are in the midst of an impressive turnaround, while Italian and German management teams wrestle with the challenges of being an incumbent. The UK, especially, is taking advantage of the merger travails of \"Everything Everywhere\" and winning back market share. The Italian management team were impressive, but face a far tougher market backdrop, while German management's appraisal of its market opportunity was the least convincing, despite healthy market trends. While we retain fundamental concerns over Vodafone's profitability in the long term, one could say the same of most companies in most industries in the short term. Relative to others, Vodafone should be relatively unaffected by supply chain problems (fewer handsets may even reduce churn), has few inflation worries and is a beneficiary of recent euro strength. Among the mid-caps, Heritage Oil added 23.8p to 313.5p on reports it had rejected an informal 425p a share offer from an unnamed Abu Dhabi company. Insulation and roofing specialist SIG climbed 9.4p to 130.5p after a 3% rise in full year profits to £62.5m and news it would start paying a dividend again in 2011. But Aveva fell 61p to £15.18 on fears the group, which suppliers software to design nuclear power stations, could be hit by any delays or cancellations to nuclear programmes. However George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon said: We make two points: nuclear is less than 5% of Aveva revenue; and, secondly, in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster, technologies which make the process more transparent (like AvevaNet) will be of greater importance. Finally investors in Cheerful Scout had little to be happy about. The Aim-listed multi-media group dropped 24% to 8.875p after it said full year results would be below expectations due to the cancellation of a telecommunications commission."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/apr/01/coal-price-reaches-new-heights","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T12:16:39Z","webTitle":"Coal price reaches new heights as demand from Asia soars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/01/coal-price-reaches-new-heights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/apr/01/coal-price-reaches-new-heights","fields":{"headline":"Coal price reaches new heights as demand from Asia soars","bodyText":"Huge demand for energy resources in China and India has pushed the price of thermal coal to an all time high, reinforcing fears about spiralling inflation. Thermal coal is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide and demand could rise still further if nuclear power programmes suffer a setback following the crisis at the Fukushima reactors in Japan. In the latest sign of a twin-track global economy – subdued growth in Europe and the US, but booming economies in most of Asia – British mining group Xstrata has clinched an annual thermal coal contract with Chugoku Electric Power of Japan worth $130 (£81) a tonne. That is 30% up on last year's level and higher than the $125 a tonne reached in 2008. Analysts say the deal is expected to set a benchmark for prices between Asian users and international mining companies. China and India last year imported 197m tonnes of coal, around nine times more than in 2003, and there are signs the trend will continue for the foreseeable future. The price of coal has been buoyed by flooding in Australia's coal-rich state of Queensland, which interrupted supplies from the world's top thermal coal exporter. And the Xstrata deal has been clinched despite a fall-off in demand from some Japanese customers that have ceased operating in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/27/water-shortages-threaten-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-27T17:38:33Z","webTitle":"Water shortages threaten renewable energy production, experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/27/water-shortages-threaten-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/27/water-shortages-threaten-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Water shortages threaten renewable energy production, experts warn","bodyText":"The development of new renewable energy technologies and other expanding sources of energy such as shale gas will be limited by the availability of water in some regions of the world, according to research by a US thinktank. The study shows the reliance on large amounts of water to create biofuels and run solar thermal energy and hydraulic fracturing – a technique for extracting gas from unconventional geological formations underground – means droughts could hamper their deployment. \"Water consumption is going up dramatically. We are introducing all kinds of technology to reduce the carbon impact of energy, without doing anything to reduce its impact on water,\" Michele Wucker, co-author of the report, told a seminar at the New America Foundation, a thinktank in Washington. The study, estimating the water consumption of conventional and renewable energy, found even so-called clean energy solutions use vast amounts of water. Hydroelectricity far outstrips other forms of energy in its use of water, requiring 4,500 gallons to produce a single megawatt hour of electricity – or about the amount needed to run a flat-screen TV for a year. Geothermal energy uses 1,400 gallons per MW/h. Corn-based ethanol uses a lot of water to irrigate crops, as do nuclear plants which rely on water for cooling systems. Even some renewable energy sources – such as solar farms – are water hogs because they rely on water for cooling. Solar thermal farms use five times as much water as nuclear power plants, energy consultant Diana Glassman told the seminar. In contrast, photovoltaic solar cells, which convert energy from the sun into electricity, use minimal amounts of water. Meanwhile, the US drought is forcing energy companies to scale back plans for deploying new techniques in hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\") for oil and gas extraction. Not long ago, energy companies were hoping to increase production in Texas by 50% over the next five years. Unlike in Pennsylvania, where the chemicals used in natural gas drilling have contaminated drinking supplies, the problems in Texas are a matter of water quantity, not water quality. \"The drought and declining water tables are going to have an increasing impact on oil and gas production in Texas,\" Glassman said. It takes up to 13m gallons of water to open up a single well in the Eagle Ford shale region in south Texas, where water is in perennially short supply. Such demands are going to block development of areas in south and west Texas, which are suffering water shortages. \"As hydraulic fracking spreads into more arid environments, water availability will increasingly become a problem. Over time it's going to be a growth constraint on oil production in parts of West Texas,\" said Glassman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/17/alan-miliburns-social-mobility-commission-publishes-annual-report-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T14:22:18Z","webTitle":"Alan Milburn's social mobility commission publishes annual report: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/17/alan-miliburns-social-mobility-commission-publishes-annual-report-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/17/alan-miliburns-social-mobility-commission-publishes-annual-report-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Alan Milburn's social mobility commission publishes annual report: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• The social mobility and child poverty commission has said that the government's attempts to achieve greater social mobility in Britain are being trumped by the economic and fiscal headwinds driving inequality. As Patrick Wintour reports, the commission, chaired by the former Labour minister Alan Milburn, finds that the coalition will miss its child poverty target by a long way and that pensioners are not bearing their share of the burden of fiscal consolidation. The government is making efforts to correct this,but not enough \"to move the dial\", the commission concludes, calling for pensioners' perks such as the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences to be withdrawn. • Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, has said that Michael Gove has suffered a \"devastating blow\" to his flagship free schools policy after a new school in Derby was condemned as dysfunctional in a hard-hitting Ofsted report. As Nicholas Watt reports, speaking in an emergency Commons debate after the Guardian published a leaked copy of the report, Hunt said Ofsted's findings into the al-Madinah school in Derby showed that Gove's free schools programme was a \"dangerous ideological\" experiment. Ed Miliband made a similar point on a visit to Peckham. What this situation highlights is that Michael Gove's free school experiment is frankly wreaking havoc in some communities. But, responding to Hunt in the Commons, David Laws, the education minister, accused Hunt of inconsistency, saying that only on Sunday he was proclaiming his support for free schools. Laws also said that in general free schools received better reports from Ofsted than other state schools. • David Cameron has urged British Gas customers to switch suppliers if they are unhappy about the company's decision to raise energy prices by 9.2%. The announcement was \"very disappointing\", Cameron told BBC Sussex radio. I think it is a very disappointing announcement by British Gas. I think there are things we can do. We are intervening because we are legislating to say these companies have to put their customers on to the lowest tariff. I think a lot of customers find it utterly baffling how many tariffs they have. But there is something everyone can do, which is look to switch their electricity or gas bill from one supplier to another. On average, this can help people save sometimes as much as £200 on their bill. So I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal. • George Osborne, the chancellor, has said that Chinese firms will be allowed to buy a stake in Britain's nuclear power industry. • Nick Clegg has said that Andrew Mitchell is right to feel \"pretty sore\" about his treatment at the hands of three police officers who called for him to resign as chief whip last year after allegedly providing a false account of a meeting. • Clegg has has welcomed the decision of parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC) to launch an inquiry into the extent and scale of mass surveillance undertaken by Britain's spy agencies. • A Conservative MP has said that the Guardian should be prosecuted if it does not hand over a decryption code that would enable the security services to read the intelligence files seized from David Miranda. Julian Smith made the point during business questions in the Commons. The editor of the Guardian recently boasted online that he was taking precautions to prevent UK security services having access to the files of vital national security that he had sent out of the remit of the UK court to the New York Times. Security services are still trying to decrypt these files, which the Independent newspaper described as 'highly detailed and a threat to national security'. Can we have a statement to reassure the House that the Guardian will be asked for a decryption key, and if not forthcoming, action will be taken? Tom Brake, the Lib Dem deputy leader of the Commons, said Smith would be able to pursue this matter further in a debate next Tuesday. But Labour's David Winnick defended the Guardian, saying it was \"receiving threats and smears ... for publishing details which is not in any way a threat to the security of our country, information which the public have a right to know\". • Labour has announced that it would impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders that would be used to double the amount of public funding for low-cost alternatives, such as credit unions. In some quarters it has been dubbed a \"Wonga tax\". Curiously, this coincides with ... • The Department for Work and Pensions has announced a £38m project to expand credit unions. • Justine Greening, the international development secretary, has said the case for a public inquiry into the war in Afghanistan will be considered \"at the highest level in government\". In the Commons the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin proposed an inquiry, saying more than twice as many British troops have died in Afghanistan as in Iraq. Greening replied: I think you make an interesting point. Obviously we have yet to go through the draw-down process between now and the end of next year. The points you have made around the lessons that we can learn from this conflict and the UK military role within it are points well made and will certainly be considered at the highest level in Government. • Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, has claimed that public opinion will swing behind the Scottish independence referendum \"Yes\" campaign in the coming months. She made the point in an interview to mark the opening of the SNP's annual conference. We’re feeling optimistic, we’re in good heart, the referendum is absolutely there to be won. When you break down the independence debate into the different powers that would transfer to Scotland then you see majorities in favour of bringing economic powers to Scotland, welfare powers to Scotland, defence powers to Scotland. So, I think there’s a natural majority there for independence ... I would predict that over the next few months you will see that translate into growing support for \"Yes\". • A poll by Ipsos MORI has shown Labour's lead over the Tories dwindling to nothing. However, as the Press Association reports, Ed Miliband's personal ratings have improved since September, when the parties stood at 37% to 34%. The proportion satisfied with his performance rose from 24% to 36%. Labour's proposal for a 20-month energy bill freeze was the most popular policy unveiled during the conference season, with 62% saying it was best for them, compared with 56% backing George Osborne's petrol duty freeze. Liberal Democrat support was down one point over the month to 9%, behind Ukip on 10%. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: The dividing lines between the leaders are a bit clearer after conference season, and they have all shored up their support - especially Ed Miliband, who has given more confidence to his own supporters. At the same time we have seen the Conservatives' vote share rise in recent months in line with economic optimism. The public's view is fascinatingly poised. • Gloria De Piero, the new shadow equalities minister, has appealed to the press to \"call off the hunt\" for topless pictures that she posed for as a teenager after learning a news agency was offering thousands of pounds for them. • The crime survey for England and Wales has reported a 7% fall in crime. • William Hague has said that the government wants the internet to remain \"open and borderless\". He made the comment in a speech to a conference in South Korea. On one side are countries like the UK and many others like Korea who argue that the internet must remain open and borderless, and benefit from collective oversight between governments, international organisations, industry and civil society. In our view this is the only way to ensure that the benefits of the digital age are expanded to all countries; that ingenuity and competition flourish and investment and enterprise are rewarded; and that the creativity that spurs economic growth is nurtured not stifled by excessive regulation. On the other side are countries calling for an international legal framework for the internet that would enable governments to exercise exclusive control over the Internet’s content and resources. I am convinced that placing the controls of cyberspace entirely in the hands of governments would be a drastic error that would have profound social and economic consequences. The dead hand of state control would be as stifling for the internet as it has been for many economies in the past. It would erect barriers that impede the free flow of ideas, and would lead to a ghettoised or two-tier cyberspace that hinders free trade and holds back economic growth and development. This world of closed, fragmented Internets would certainly be less free and democratic – but it would also be less creative, less innovative, less progressive and, ultimately, less prosperous than a world with a single and open Internet. • Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has said that the badger cull in Gloucestershire failed to meet its target. • The Department for Education has said that only 27% of schools in regions targeted by the NUT and NASUWT teachers' strike have had to close. David Cameron said it was \"very disappointing\" that teachers went on strike. I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike. It is very inconvenient for parents, it is not good for pupils' education. And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews ... I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. So every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids. • David Laws, the education minister, has announced that more scholarships and bursaries will be available to encourage talented graduates into teaching key subjects. • The Department for Education has published figures showing an increase in the number of pupils taking EBacc subjects at GCSE.

It makes crystal clear that in-work poverty is a defining problem of our times and that ensuring rising pay and greater opportunities to progress in work are essential to Britain's social and economic future. It is welcome that the report identifies policies such as tackling low pay and extending childcare support that could make a real difference even in an era of austerity. From Frances O' Grady, general secretary of the TUC The UK’s living standards crisis isn’t just hurting families today, it risks causing more poverty and poorer career prospects for future generations too. The government has made the crisis worse with social security cuts that have hit low-paid working families hard. In-work poverty can only be tackled through higher wages and a decent safety net for those who fall on hard times. This means a higher minimum wage and encouraging employers to pay fairer wages through living wage agreements and new wage councils. It also means the government must stop its assault on social security that is hurting low-paid workers as well as those seeking jobs. Britain needs a pay rise to tackle child poverty and improve social mobility. Ministers must work with unions and employers to ensure that the benefits of our recovery are shared fairly throughout the workforce. From Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group The report is clear that the current child poverty strategy has been blind to labour market failures, despite most poor children these days coming from homes with work. We need firm action to help families suffering problems like low pay, lack of full-time work and job insecurity. The government should start by taking up the Commission’s recommendation to increase the National Minimum Wage and to give all low earner families a higher level of childcare support under Universal Credit. The simplest approach of giving the full 85% childcare support to all including the lowest paid would help reduce child poverty and get more second earners and lone parents into paid work. Overall, the Commission’s report is a timely reminder that we will not reduce the unacceptable levels of child poverty in Britain unless politicians are prepared to make active choices to help families. This means action to ensure fair pay, fair rents, fair energy prices and affordable childcare. It also requires a firm commitment that in future years, prosperity will be much more fairly shared by all. From William Higham, UK director of Save the Children Political leaders need to accept the urgent challenge to make work pay. The commission highlights the fact that two thirds of all UK children in poverty live in homes where at least one of the adults work. Action must be taken – including encouraging employers to pay a living wage – so working people and their children can escape the weekly grind of living on the breadline. From Fiona Weir, chief executive of the singe parents charity Gingerbread This report highlights the key issues facing single parent families today: a lack of jobs that pay a decent wage, high childcare costs and the need for tailored support to help them overcome barriers to work. The government has a real opportunity to transform the lives of many working single parents who are bringing their children up in poverty. Providing extra childcare support would ensure the government delivers on its promise to make every extra hour of work pay. From Paul Green, director of communications for Saga Alan Milburn appears to be a bit bonkers and is barking up the wrong tree. Playing the politics of envy is not way to create a cohesive society. Young people are not poorer because their parents have worked hard and are richer. Pensioners may have paid off their mortgages, but they have fewer opportunities to earn more and change their financial circumstances than others in society. Here's Patrick Wintour's story about the report. And Michael White on a Guardian blog says Milburn is right to expect pensioners to contribute more. Tristram Hunt v David Laws - Verdict: For Tristram Hunt, that did not quite work. UQs (urgent questions) are devices used by the opposition to embarrass the government, by exposing failings in policy or adminstration, and on paper this should have been a good opportunity for Hunt, who was promoted to the shadow cabinet less than two weeks ago. The Ofsted report on the Al-Madinah school is truly damning. But Hunt failed to unsettle David Laws who saw off the newcomer quite comfortably. So, what went wrong? Laws accused Labour of \"total and utter opportunism\" and a flagrant U-turn. He said that Hunt turned up on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday saying he was in favour for free schools and that now he was showing he was against them. Actually, that's unfair. Hunt's message is that he is in favour of the Labour model of free schools (or \"parent-led academies\", as he calls them), but that this is different from the Gove model, not least in oversight arrangements. But today Hunt went over the top, implying that the entire free school approach was flawed. It is not just Al-Madinah school which is dysfunctional. It is the education secretary's free school policy. This allowed Laws to say, in reply, most free schools were actually doing rather well. Hunt would have done better if he had focused more on specific failings (such as the number of staff at the school without proper qualifications). Another problem was that his response to Laws was a bit too short. And he also suffered from lack of support on the backbenches. There were not many Labour MPs behind him to reinforce the points he was making. But, for one reason or another (it did look like a whips' operation), Laws had plenty of Conservative MPs on his side to echo his arguments about Labour. You can't win an argument in the Commons simply by repetition, but it can help. Laws says the government does not support pupils being made to wear the veil. And that's it. The urgent question is over. Guy Opperman, a Conservative, says one bad apple does not spoil the barrel. Laws agrees. Tristram Hunt is not saying Labour's academies programme was wrong because some schools failed. Labour's policy is incoherent, he says. Bob Stewart, a Conservative, asks what is happening to the children at the school. Laws says Lord Nash is taking steps to address the problems they are facing. Robert Halfon, a Conservative, says free schools are transforming opportunities at this school. We should not use the failings at one school to become the enemies of promise, he says. Laws agrees. Peter Bone, a Conservative, asks Laws to confirm the DfE can close the school done if it cannot be improved. Laws says the DfE can do that. Lord Nash made that clear in his letter, he says. (See 10.47am.) Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative, accuses Labour of using one free school to criticise all free schools. John Bercow says Bridgen should ask a question about the policy of the government, not about the opposition. Labour's Alan Whitehead says almost all the teachers an Al-Madinah were unqualified. Laws says if schools do not recruit teachers who can do the job, the DfE will act. Labour's Chi Onwurah asks Laws to accept that the DfE cannot provide free schools with the scutiny they need. Laws says the fact that he is answering an urgent question about a single free school shows that it can. Laws says anyone trying to understand Labour's policy on free schools this week \"would be rather confused\". Laws says parents with children at free schools will be worried by Labour's about-turn on this issue. Laws says some teachers who are not qualified can do a superb job. A Conservative MP says the chair of governors at the school is a member and fundraiser for Labour. Laws says Labour did not give inadequate schools the same attention this school has received. Laws says Lord Nash, the education minister, has written to the chair of governors at the Al-Madinah school. Here's an excerpt from the letter. It is important to correct a misunderstanding on your part regarding Ofsted’s role. Ofsted is not the regulator for your school. lt has the function of carrying out inspections of independent schools, including academies. But it is not up to Ofsted to decide if the Trust has breached the undertakings it gave in the funding agreement. That decision rests with the Secretary of State. The Trust is operating an independent, state-funded school. This Department will determine whether you are fulfilling the contractual promises you gave when the funding agreement was signed. I have read Ofsted’s report dated 17 October 2013. It fully confirms the grounds for the very serious concerns raised in my letter dated 8 October 2013. The report is further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement | have required you to address. Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, l am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the Trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school. Labour's Barry Sheerman asks for an assurance that no schools will be allowed to treat girls and boys differently. Laws agrees. He says the DfE has made it clear to the Al-Madinah school that it must not do that. Graham Stuart, the Conservative chair of the education committee, asks if Laws will replace the chair of governors. Laws says he is taking steps to improve the board of governors. He cannot go into further details. Laws is replying to Hunt. He says Hunt's support for free schools did not last. On Sunday Hunt said he was in favour of them. But in the same set of DfE cuttings, there was a headline from a story saying that Labour planned to rein in free schools. There was a pre-registration report, he says. That is normal. The school went through the points raised by Ofsted. Two months after the school opened the DfE sent an adviser there, who concluded it was making good progress. But concerns were raised this year. Then Ofsted was sent to the school. Laws says 75% of free schools that have been opened have been rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. That is better than local authority schools, he says. At the end of Labour's period in office more than 1,000 schools were rated as inadequate, he says. Hunt has \"stood on his head\" today. It is \"total and utter opportunism\", he says. Tristram Hunt says today's report shows that the free school programme has become \"a dangerous free for all\". The school was closed for a week, leaving 400 children without learning. This is a devastating blow to Michael Gove's policy, he says. Ofsted questioned the checks imposed by the school on staff even before it opened, he says. It is not just the school that is dysfunctional. It is Gove's free school policy. David Laws is replying. He apologises for the fact that Michael Gove is not replying. Gove is abroad, he says. The school has been open for just a year, he says. In the summer the DfE became aware of funding problems at the school. There were also concerns about the dress code at the school. An investigation was launched. It found numerous breaches of the conditions in its funding conditions. The DfE asked for an Ofsted report. That report has been published. It shows the school is dysfunctional. The school must address the problems. Others its funding will be cut off. The DfE will not let any school languish in failure, he says. Tristram Hunt asks the question. He asks for a statement on the failings of the Al-Madinah free school. Normally the failings at a single school do not have major political repercussions. But Michael Gove has put free schools at the heart of his drive to reform the English education system, and so the revelation that things are going badly wrong at the Muslim Al-Madinah free school in Derby is embarrassing. And for Labour's new shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, it is more than embarrassing; it is evidence that there are systematic weaknesses in the free school governance structure set up by Gove. Tristram Hunt is about to table an urgent question on the school. There has been some confusion about who is replying, but the Department for Education tell me it will be David Laws, the schools minister. Here is some background reading • Today's Guardian news story saying Ofsted has concluded that the Al-Madinah free school is \"in chaos\". • The Ofsted report on the school. • The Department for Education's statement today about the report. This report provides further evidence of Al-Madinah’s failings. We are now even more convinced of the need for decisive and urgent action. Ministers had already put the school on notice that its funding will be cancelled unless there are major improvements. Here is some assorted early Twitter comment on the Milburn report. I'll write more about the report later. But now I'm going to focus for a bit on the urgent question on the Al-Madinah free school. Here's the full text of Alan Milburn's speech unveiling the social mobility commission's report. And here's the 348-page report itself (pdf). Alan Milburn's social mobility commission report will not be available online until about 10am, I'm told. But I've got a copy of his statement unveiling it. Here are some key extracts. The findings We know these are challenging times in which to make progress. Britain faces a triple squeeze on economic growth, family incomes and public spending. In these circumstances it would have been all too easy for Government to abandon the aim of ending child poverty by 2020 and to avoid the long hard haul of making progress on social mobility. We believe the UK Government deserves credit for sticking to these commitments and making new ones. The test we apply in this Report, however, is not about good intentions. We take those as read. It is about whether the right actions are being taken.We find in our Report a mix of good and bad news. On child poverty the UK has gone from having one of the highest levels in Europe to a rate near the average over the last 15 years. Since 2010 there has been a dramatic 15% decline in the number of children in workless households but recently there has been a big rise in the numbers of poor children measured as being in absolute poverty and in working poor families. On employment we find that there are more people in work than ever before but that the numbers of young people unemployed for over two years is at a twenty-year high and the Government has been too slow to act. On living standards we find that real wages were stagnating before the recession and have fallen by over 10% since 2009. Real median weekly earnings are now lower than they have been for over a decade, putting many more families under pressure and forcing many more low-income earners below the poverty line. On public spending we find that some services, such as schools, have been relatively protected from cuts but that overall fiscal consolidation has been regressive with the bottom 20% making a bigger contribution than all but the top 20% and an inter-generational injustice which sees better-off pensioners protected but families with children bearing two-thirds of spending cuts. On schools we welcome the Government’s energetic focus on reform to drive social mobility and find that the gap between the poorest and the rest has narrowed at primary school and GCSE but widened at A-level. The most deprived areas still have 30% fewer good schools and get fewer good teachers than the least deprived. On moving people into work we welcome the big expansion in apprenticeships but not the decision to abolish the Educational Maintenance Allowance. We find that the Universal Credit could be transformative in encouraging more people into paid employment but its impact is weakened by high childcare costs. On universities the worst fears about the negative impact of tuition fees have not been realized so far but big falls in applications from mature and part time students and the failure of top universities to diversify their social intake are causes for concern. On the professions we find greater efforts to open doors to a wider pool of talent but new research for this Report finds that class is now a bigger barrier than gender to getting ahead in a top professional career. Senior professionals are still more likely to be privately schooled and privileged men. Summary of the situation There is much to welcome in what Government, employers, schools and universities are doing. We see considerable effort and a raft of initiatives underway. The question is whether the scale and depth of activity is enough to combat the headwinds that Britain faces if we are to move forward to become a low poverty, high mobility society. The conclusion we reach is that it is currently not. We conclude that the statutory goal of ending child poverty by 2020 will in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin, perhaps by as many as 2 million children We challenge all political parties to say how they would make progress. We conclude too that the economic recovery is unlikely to halt the trend of the last decade, where the top part of society prospers and the bottom part stagnates. If that happens social inequality will widen and the rungs of the social ladder will grow further apart. The promising reforms we see in schools and some aspects of welfare will not, on their own, offset the twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards that are storing up trouble for the future. We see a danger that social mobility – having risen in the middle of the last century then flat-lined towards the end – could go into reverse in the first part of this century. To avert this we believe that policy-makers need to come to terms with a new truth that emerges from the mass of evidence contained in our Report. Although entrenched poverty has to be a priority - and requires a specific policy agenda some of which the Government is pursuing - transient poverty, growing insecurity and stalling mobility are far more widespread than politicians, employers and educators have so far recognised. Recommendations Our key recommendations for Government are that it firstly, aims to end long-term youth unemployment by increasing learning and earning opportunities for young people who should be expected to take up those opportunities or face tougher benefit conditionality. Secondly, that it reduces in-work poverty by getting the Low Pay Commission to deliver a higher minimum wage, rewards employment support providers for the earnings people receive not just for finding them a job and reallocates Budget 2013 childcare funding from higher rate taxpayers to help those on Universal Credit meet more of their childcare costs. Thirdly, that it better resources careers services, pays the best teachers more to teach in the worst schools and helps low-attainers from average income families as well as low-income children to succeed in making it to the top, rather than aiming to simply get them off the bottom to succeed at school. Next, employers will need to more actively step up to the plate. Our key recommendations are that, firstly, they will need to provide higher minimum levels of pay and better career prospects, enabled by higher skills. Secondly, we call on half of all firms to offer apprenticeships and work experience as part of a new effort to make it easier for those who aren’t going to university - “the other 50 per cent” - to pursue high quality vocational training. Thirdly, we call on the professions to to end unpaid internships and recruit from a broader cross-section of society than many do at present. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we say that every citizen who can should be expected actively to work their way out of poverty by seeking jobs, working enough hours and seizing the opportunities made available to them. We say that the key influencers on children’s life chances are not schools or governments or careers services. They are parents. And we urge Government to break one of the great taboos of public policy by doing far more to help parents to parent. And Frank Field, the Labour former welfare minister, put out this statement overnight about the social mobility commission's report. Anyone – like an MP – who works with talented young graduates for a decade or more knows that they will achieve far less in respect of material possessions than established MPs have already achieved. When I left university I expected to get a job, be a member of a generous pension scheme, acquire savings and buy at least one home. The young people working with me know they’re lucky if they’re able to achieve just one of these objectives. To say that today’s children and young people will gain far less material possessions than their parents is old hat. What we need to know is why there has been this huge shift in rewards and then do our best to counter them. We're getting an urgent question today on the Al-Madinah free school. The social mobility commission's report is not out yet, but the National Pensioners Convention has already reaction to the reports saying it will suggest pensioners should pay more. This is from Dot Gibson, the NPC's general secretary. Older people have seen a cut to the value of their pensions with the switch from the retail price index to the lower consumer price ndex, a reduction in the winter fuel allowance, a freeze to their personal tax allowances, the removal of £1.8bn from social care budgets and the decline of many other public services. The majority of older people don’t even have enough money coming in to pay tax, so this idea that pensioners have done well at the expense of younger generations is dangerous – when the real division is between the rich with their generous bonuses and the rest of us who are struggling to get by. Gibson also criticises Nick Clegg for apparently changing his mind on this issue. (See 8.57am.) What’s surprising is Nick Clegg’s reaction to the suggestion that wealthier pensioners should lose their universal benefits. In the past he has been in favour of this kind of policy, but now he seems to be changing his mind. Perhaps he realises there’s an election coming and pensioners are likely to get out and vote. Clegg is asked if he is glad the Guardian is going to be investigated by a select committee over the Edward Snowden leaks. Clegg says that last week he said that publishing details about how intelligence works could be harmful. But there is also a need for proper oversight of the intelligence services, he says. Clegg is now talking about \"plebgate\", and the three Police Federation officers criticised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission for giving a misleading account of their meeting with Andrew Mitchell. Clegg backs the call for the officers to face disciplinary action. When the Police Federation officers met Mitchell, they were just intent on going out afterwards and telling the world that Mitchell should resign, Clegg says. Nick Clegg is now taking calls on LBC. The first caller asks if Clegg will sack Vince Cable for under-pricing Royal Mail when he sold it off. No, says Clegg. Cable took independent advice before setting the sale price. We're getting a major report on social mobility and child poverty today. It's from the commission set up to monitor the government's progress in addressing these issues which is chaired by Alan Milburn, the former Labour health secretary. We will get the full report this morning but some of its main findings have already been briefed in advance. • The Observer said the report would say middle-class children are on course to do less well then their parents, for the first time in 100 years. Today's middle-class children are on track to be the first in more than a century to be materially less well off in adulthood than their parents, a government commission is expected to warn this week. Leaked findings reveal the existence of a national trend not experienced since the early 20th century, with children from families with above-average incomes, as well as the most deprived, set to enjoy a worse standard of living when they grow up than their mothers and fathers. • The Guardian says the report will say the working poor have suffered most from the coalition's austerity measures. The working poor have borne the brunt of the coalition's deficit reduction programme, with pensioners getting off lightest, according to the first annual reporton Thursday of the government's social mobility commission chaired by Alan Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister. • The Daily Telegraph says the report will say that pensioners should contribute more. • The BBC says the report will say that work no longer provides a route of of poverty. The suggestion that pensioners should contribute more has already caused a controversy. In an article in the Daily Telegraph, Nick Clegg says he disagrees. [The report] has many powerful recommendations, such as the need to ensure child care funding makes work pay even for families on low incomes, and the need to do more on vocational education. But it also makes some more debatable assertions, about the appropriate balance of fiscal consolidation between different age groups, for example – punishing pensioners isn’t going to help a single child achieve more in life. But we established this Commission precisely to hold government to account and that is exactly what they are doing. I will be covering the report, and the reaction to it, in detail. Here's the agenda for the day. 9am: Nick Clegg hosts his LBC phone-in show. 9.30am: Alan Milburn, chair of the social mobility and child poverty commission, publishes its first annual “state of the nation report”. 9.30am: Ed Davey, the energy secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 9.30am: The Department for Education publishes figures for GCSE and A-level achievement. 10.30am: Ed Miliband visits Peckham to hightlight Labour's plans to impose a tax on payday lenders to fund cheaper alternatives like credit unions. 10.10am: Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, speaks at the British Chamebrs of Commerce conference. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary at about 1pm. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jul/28/china-fast-train-to-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-28T21:00:04Z","webTitle":"China is on the fast train to disaster | Isabel Hilton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/china-fast-train-to-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/china-fast-train-to-disaster","fields":{"headline":"China is on the fast train to disaster","bodyText":"China's high-speed rail network seemed to symbolise the nation's unstoppable rise: since the first line opened in 2007, it has built more than 6,000 miles of track and seemed poised to spread the magic into overseas markets, bidding aggressively against established international players. Yet this week, families were mourning the 39 dead and tending the 200 injured in Saturday's crash, the latest and worst episode in the high-speed rail fiasco. A project said to show China was poised for leadership in advanced technologies is collapsing in death, anger and embarrassment. How it went so badly wrong carries some dark lessons for China. It's a story of corruption and corner-cutting and of responsibility passed around an opaque and untouchable bureaucracy. It is also a lesson in a nationalistic habit of \"digesting\" foreign technology, as one railway official put it, then changing it, so as to claim the result as a Chinese invention. The lines have been plagued by breakdowns; the track, according to foreign experts, is substandard and likely to crack. The railway minister has been sacked and is under investigation for corruption, and costs have tripled. Bloggers claim the government is more intent on a cover up than an investigation. These are not the only chickens coming home to roost. A series of scandals has wiped millions off the share price of several Chinese companies. Revelations of fraudulent accounting in China have shattered investor confidence. As with the rail, this has raised questions: without more accountability and transparency, is China really ready to take the next, difficult steps? How can a system that allows so little objective analysis ever achieve that accountability? These are questions that matter as much to China's partners as they do to the government. Corruption has destroyed confidence in China's prestige projects. Corruption also kills: it killed children in Sichuan in 2008 when their schools collapsed, and migrant workers in Shanghai last year when their apartment building became a deadly inferno; it killed babies who were given poisoned milk, drivers on collapsing bridges and thousands each year with vegetables irrigated with contaminated water. Corruption was a prominent theme in President Hu Jintao's speech to the Communist party's recent 90th birthday celebrations, as it has been in almost every leader's speech for decades. Yet the conditions that make such corruption endemic remain untouched: the monopoly of power in the hands of an untouchable institution. The prosecution of individuals, however high-profile the trials, has done nothing to change that. China's 30-year economic rise has been impressive, but suspicion over basic data makes it all but impossible to determine how sustainable it is. The boastful speed of railway construction recalls the Great Leap Forward in the late 50s, when officials were set absurd targets for food production and duly reported them met. Some 30 million people starved to death. The leadership's response to each of these disasters has been the same: to suppress discussion, silence the victims and paint itself as the solution, not the problem. Last week, when local witnesses protested that railway officials had hastily buried wrecked carriages, there was indignation but little surprise. China Digital Times reported that the central propaganda department had instructed the media that they \"must speedily report whatever information is released by the Railway Ministry\". Unless systemic lessons are learned, there is more to fear. China is embarking on the world's biggest and fastest expansion of nuclear power. The world must pray the industry will somehow prove immune to the curse of corner cutting, secrecy and corruption – or the potential consequences are chilling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/2011/mar/15/michael-white-blog-japan-nuclear-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T13:38:15Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear crisis: another narrow escape or a triumph for technology?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/mar/15/michael-white-blog-japan-nuclear-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2011/mar/15/michael-white-blog-japan-nuclear-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear crisis: another narrow escape or a triumph for technology?","bodyText":"When confronted with a science-based controversy beyond one's understanding the best course is to listen most closely not to the politicians or environmental doomsayers, but to the scientists. It's not that they're always right, but they do understand the evidence. So I decided years ago. As a third explosion shakes Fukushima 1 nuclear power plant in Japan and everyone gets excited, it's still the most reliable course in my experience. Ian Sample sets it out well – complete with graphic – in today's Guardian. And you can read the live blog here. So what are the scientists saying? From what I've read and heard on radio and TV since the Japan earthquake and tsunami struck on Friday, it's the scientists who are most calm about the nuclear crisis, which has – at the moment – overshadowed the wider, purely natural disaster. One useful point they make is that although most of the affected area has been flattened, the power stations are still standing. Flooding the radioactive fuel rods with seawater to cool them is the right thing to do, they add. This is not Chernobyl II. Despite errors – hardly surprising in the circumstances – the Japanese seem to have it in hand. That's hardly surprising either, is it? Japan has been enduring earthquakes and tsunamis on the unstable edge of the Pacific for millennia. As Ben MacIntyre was quick to point out in Saturday's Times, the artist Katsushika Hokusai's famous 1830 woodblock print of The Great Wave off Kanagawa looks like a tsunami wave, something which had not occurred to me, though the interpretation is disputed. Japan also endured the only two atomic bomb attacks in history, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Of all people, the Japanese are likeliest to have made the connection between these rival forms of apocalyptic destructive power and ensured that their nuclear power plants – always controversial there, but unavoidable given Japan's lack of fossil fuels – were safe. When I first saw pictures of the devastation on TV, whole towns levelled but for a few robust structures, it immediately reminded me of those black-and-white photos of Hiroshima after the bomb, the full horrors of which only began to be understood after John Hershey published Hiroshima in the New Yorker magazine in August 1946. Yet memories fade, and I have caught few such comparisons between the two traumatic bursts of destruction. It is only this morning that the Daily Mail – always quick off the mark, if only relatively so – has printed a double page \"Echoes of Hiroshima\" spread comparing the bombed city of 1945 and the flattened towns of north-east Japan in 2011. On Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Prof Sir John Beddington, the chief scientific adviser to the British government, was very matter of fact despite the efforts of all and sundry to get him excited – the pattern on 24/7 rolling news channels all weekend. If there's a serious meltdown and radioactive material reacts with the surrounding concrete – \"a big if,\" he said – causing an explosion, the radioactive leak would rise no more than 500 metres high (1,640ft) and thus be localised. Compare that with the 9,000m (30,000ft) reached after the uncontrolled explosions following the graphite core catching fire at Chernobyl, when the wind took the pollution around the world and into the food chain for years. Even so, the 18-mile exclusion zone around Chernobyl in 1986 was probably right, as is the 12-mile zone around Fukushima, Beddington said. Even if the wind is driving the leaked material towards Tokyo (today apparently it is) it does not pose much of a threat. On Today, the BBC's Jim Naughtie, reporting from Tokyo, has been saying the Japanese government has misled its people on nuclear matters in the past – as did our own authorities after the Windscale disaster in Cumbria in 1957 – and is not trusted. Yet now it is staging rolling press conferences and sounds worried. Is that a \"just to be on the safe side\" over-reaction by an unpopular government anxious not to be accused of complacency? I wouldn't be surprised. What is striking about the TV pictures is the self-control they seem to reveal in survivors. No looting, no riots, stoicism of those walking to work through the rubble. Dammit, on top of everything else, it's been snowing. Would folk behave that way in Los Angeles? On air this morning, someone said the disaster would give Japanese civil society a chance to assert itself against the corporate ethos which has been so dominant in the postwar era, even in the \"lost decade\" period, which has been going on since the 1990s. We'll see. In the short term, as Julia Finch points out on today's financial pages, the loss, which is likely to be permanent, of nuclear capacity in Japan will mean higher gas prices to fill the gap – and that means higher gas prices for all of us. Will it mean another knock-back for the nuclear industry worldwide? Angela Merkel has announced the temporary closure of Germany's two oldest plants while the Swiss have put their own nuclear rebuilding plans on hold to assuage fickle public opinion. Germany's dislike of nuclear power is evident in its forest of wind turbines – though their efficacy is much disputed. But I suspect the underlying lesson of Fukushima will turn out to be that, even after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake, nuclear plants – 40-year-old nuclear plants – can be built that survive, more or less in tact. Touch wood. In which case, as the Guardian's editorial suggests, the rational case for nuclear may – may – emerge even stronger. Nobody wants the lights to go out, but fossil fuels face sharply rising demand and more benign renewables seem to be only part of the solution. Yet the deeper, troubling thought is also to remind us how indifferent nature is to our vulnerability as a species. See how that wall of water took the Japanese version of our sophisticated, comfortable wired society and smashed it to pieces in a few minutes. We know this, but we like to forget it. Only this week Spanish scientists claimed (again) to have unearthed Atlantis, which disappeared below the ocean after some apocalyptic event, though others ascribe the myth – if that is what it is – to the earthquake which damaged, if not destroyed, Minoan civilisation, circa 1700BC. The biblical flood is obviously rooted in collective memory of a similar traumatic event, as must be Hokusai's Great Wave off Kanagawa. The difference is that in the coastal villages of north-eastern Japan – as with the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami in the Indian Ocean, only more so – we can watch it in real time, filmed on countless cameras. Imagine if the caldera erupted beneath Yellowstone national park. On balance I'd rather not. But governments are paid to worry about such things and to confront reluctant electorates with hard choices. We are still busy building, as usual, on the slopes of Vesuvius."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"world/2011/mar/27/chernobyl-disaster-anniversary-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-27T00:06:00Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl 25 years on: a poisoned landscape","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/chernobyl-disaster-anniversary-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/27/chernobyl-disaster-anniversary-japan","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl 25 years on: a poisoned landscape","bodyText":"Yuri Tatarchuk has a disconcerting way of demonstrating Chernobyl's grim radioactive legacy. An official guide at the wrecked nuclear power plant, he waves his radiation counter at a group of abandoned Soviet army vehicles that were used in the battle to clean up the contamination created by the reactor explosion in 1986. \"Some of these trucks are quite clean, but some of them not,\" he announces. A sweep of his counter reveals only a few clicks from their doors and roofs. Then he passes the device over one vehicle's tracks. A sudden angry chatter reveals significant levels of radiation. \"Wheels and tracks pick contamination from the soil,\" he tells the group that has gathered round him. \"There is still plenty of radioactive isotopes – caesium, strontium, even some plutonium – in the ground and we cannot get rid of them.\" Twenty-five years on, Chernobyl remains a poisoned landscape. Set among lakes, sandy soil and forests on steppe lands north of Kiev, Chernobyl achieved global notoriety in 1986 when technicians carried out an experiment aimed at testing backup electrical supplies to one of the plant's four reactors. The flow of water – used as a coolant to carry away the mighty heat of the reactor core – was raised and lowered. After a few minutes, there was a sudden jump in reactor power. Ten seconds later the core was blown apart by a massive explosion. Without a containment vessel, the reactor's deadly radioactive contents were borne high into the air by the heat of the core's burning graphite and spread over much of Europe, triggering an international panic. In the blast's immediate aftermath, 31 plant operators and firemen died – they were not told the reactor was the cause of the blaze or that radiation levels were lethal – while thousands more people, living on land that is now in Ukraine and Belarus, received doses that undoubtedly shortened their lives, although scientists still dispute the death toll. The World Health Organisation puts it at 4,000; Greenpeace says 200,000. Significant levels of radioactive caesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium isotopes still pollute the ground. In one zone, dubbed the Red Forest, it reached levels 20 times higher than the contamination at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and remains highly dangerous. The Chernobyl explosion was the world's worst nuclear accident and is the only one classified as level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Next month will mark the 25th anniversary of the blast, a birthday that has acquired a dramatic resonance following the Fukushima reactor fires in Japan, which have resurrected global fears that nuclear mayhem could afflict the planet again – though it should be noted that the accident there measured only 5 on the nuclear event scale. Chernobyl clearly has much to tell us about the dangers of nuclear power. Hence the recent soaring interest in the plant which, bizarrely, has become a popular tourist destination for foreign visitors to Ukraine. My coach trip last Thursday from Kiev was a sellout – with the 25-strong party including 15 members of the German, US, Russian, Dutch and British media. Television crews fought to interview the few baffled punters on the bus about the forthcoming anniversary, while other journalists simply interviewed each other. Your correspondent was cross-examined for Russian TV about the safety of nuclear power as he stood in front of the radioactive ruins of reactor no 4. It was an extraordinary affair led by the ebullient Tatarchuk, a chunky, cheerful Ukrainian wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan \"Hard Rock Café – Chernobyl\". Sites on our strange tour included the buried village of Kopachi, a close-up look at reactor number 4 itself, a very quick drive through the Red Forest, and an exploration of the abandoned city of Pripyat. Radiation counters were handed out, and if these started to chatter too quickly – usually if we wandered off paths and on to open soil – we were told to make a detour. It was startlingly casual and, in the end, highly unsettling. The Ukrainian steppe is still frost-burned and the trees leafless at this time of year. There are no buds on branches and little hint of greenery, a combination that only enhances the eerie desolation inside the 30km exclusion zone around the reactor. This land has seen harrowing times. It was occupied by German troops and most communities have memorials to the Soviet soldiers who liberated them – including the village of Kopachi inside the zone. In fact, Kopachi's memorial is just about all that is left of the place, thanks to Chernobyl. \"Kopachi was very badly contaminated and so it was decided to bury it, house by house,\" says Tatarchuk. \"It seemed a good idea at the time, but it wasn't. The digging only pushed radioactive material deeper into the soil and closer to the water table, so that contamination spread even further.\" It transpires that devastating errors like these were common. The only other evidence of Kopachi's existence is the primary school near the memorial. Its windows have rotted and the front door hangs on a single hinge. It is also clear that it was abandoned in haste. Schoolbooks, jotters, sheets of music and road safety leaflets litter the hall floor while a single doll – its face blackened and cracked – lies on a cot inside one classroom. Equally disturbing is the vast artificial lake built near the main plant, which was used to provide water coolant for its four reactors. The lake is frozen now, but while Chernobyl's reactors were operating its water was warm all year round. Lichen blossomed, so a fish farm was built to populate the lake with catfish that ate the lichen and kept the waters clear. After the reactor explosion, the lake was showered with radioactive debris which sank to the bottom. Today water has to be pumped constantly from the nearby river Pripyat to stop the lake evaporating in summer and exposing its toxic sediments, which would dry out and be spread by the wind. However, it is Pripyat that provides the most disturbing evidence of the events of 25 years ago. The city was built to house the families of workers who manned the vast reactor complex at Chernobyl. Four reactors had been built by 1986 and two more were under construction. This was to be the biggest nuclear power complex in Europe. Fifty thousand people had homes here. Reactor no 4 blew up in the early hours of 26 April, but no one told the people of Pripyat. All that day, children were allowed to play outside, despite the plume of radioactive material emerging from the reactor a few kilometres away. Of course, there were rumours of a fire, but people had been indoctrinated to believe a reactor accident was impossible – until a fleet of buses arrived at 2pm the next day, 36 hours after the explosion, and Pripyat's people were shipped off to camps and resettlement centres. At the time, they were told they would be allowed back to their homes within three days, but in the end they were never allowed to return. For an hour, our group wandered round Pripyat, stepping over broken glass and lumps of wood and stone, with the constant chirrup of our radiation counters providing warnings if we strayed too far. Everywhere nature can be seen to be taking back its territory. Trees have erupted through the thick concrete steps of Pripyat's central plaza, while the surrounding woods – which now provide homes for healthy populations of wolves, deer and boar – have spread over every piece of open ground. Inside the city, books are littered over the grimy floors of the main library while outside, a Ferris wheel – set up to celebrate May Day that year – is slowly rusting. How many people received fatal doses of radiation in those 36 hours of exposure remains a matter of dispute. Although cheery for most of the trip, Yuri's anger about the fate of the people of Pripyat at the hands of Ukraine's former Soviet masters became all too clear: \"People were told that they had received a radiation dose of no more than 25 rems, enough to cause only minor illness. But that just was not true. They must have got hundreds of rems, fatal doses. \"It was criminal. People should have been given proper diagnoses and proper treatment. They got nothing. At least 5,000 people were badly affected at the time, while women who were pregnant were simply told to have abortions. It was a cruel time.\" Today workers are allowed to live in the village of Chernobyl, but for no more than four days at a time. With all four reactors at the plant closed down, they are helping to decontaminate the land within the exclusion zone and to decommission the plant's first three undamaged reactors. As to reactor no 4, the concrete sarcophagus that hides its wrecked, exposed, radioactive core is now crumbling and work has started on a replacement – although Ukraine has made it clear that it will need international assistance to ensure the project's successful completion. This is a nation which will have to bear the consequences of the world's worst nuclear accident for a long time to come. As to the comparison between Fukushima and Chernobyl, Tatarchuk is emphatic: \"No, it is not as bad in Japan as it was here, not by a long way. But there are lots of similarities. Basically, we had high radiation and no information in 1986, and that seems to be going on once more. That is the pattern when these things happen.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-great-successor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-19T18:46:26Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-il's 'great successor' is poorly equipped for issues facing North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-great-successor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-great-successor","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-il's 'great successor' is poorly equipped for issues facing North Korea","bodyText":"However North Korea's ruling elite proceeds with the dynastic transfer of power following Kim Jong-il's death, there is agreement that the man chosen to succeed him is ill-equipped to deal with the myriad domestic and international challenges facing one of the world's most repressive, and unpredictable, regimes. Just over a year ago, few people were aware of Kim Jong-un, the former leader's third and youngest son, who largely by dint of the personality traits he shares with his father and the unsuitability of his brothers, has been propelled to the top of the state's power structure with unexpected haste. Like his father before him, Kim Jong-un's biography is as flattering as it is improbable: claims about his brilliance at military strategy are harder to believe than his reported fluency in several languages and aptitude for computers and technology. Other parts of his life remain shrouded in secrecy, including his date of birth (he is thought to be in his late 20s), marital status and the identity of his mother, whom most analysts believe to be Kim Jong-il's second wife, who died several years ago. The leader-in-waiting, who shares his father's chubby frame but facially more closely resembles his grandfather, was reportedly educated at a Swiss boarding school, where he is said to have excelled at skiing and basketball – he is apparently an admirer of Michael Jordan – and learned to speak English, German and French. In a 2003 book, Kenji Fujimoto, a Japanese chef who worked as Kim Jong-il's personal cook before fleeing back to Japan, described Kim Jong-un as \"a chip off the old block, a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality\". The first time they met, the young Jong-un \"glared at me with a menacing look when we shook hands\", Fujimoto wrote in his memoir, I Was Kim Jong-il's Cook. \"I can never forget the look in his eyes which seemed to be saying, 'This one is a despicable Japanese.'\" Kim Jong-un is believed to have accompanied his father on a trip to China in May this year, apparently in an attempt to win support for his succession from Beijing, North Korea's only remaining ally and a major donor of aid. He is also reported to have travelled to China with his father in August 2010, when Kim senior met Chinese president Hu Jintao and appealed for diplomatic and financial support for his son's succession. Few analysts believe that Kim Jong-un – whose induction into the upper echelons of the ruling Workers' party was just over a year ago – will be granted the same authority his father enjoyed. It is possible that Kim Jong-un, who lacks the years of political experience his father had before becoming leader in 1994, will initially act as the figurehead of a regime run by influential members of the military and ruling party, according to Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. \"Chances that the North Korean military is attempting a coup are very low, because North Korea has called itself a nation sharing a common destiny, Kim Jong-un,\" he said. \"I think the collective leadership of the party, government and military will go on for a while, because Kim Jong-un is still young.\" South Korean media have reported that Jang Song-taek, Kim Jong-il's 65-year-old brother-in-law and a trusted member of his inner circle, had been acting as a mentor to Kim Jong-un in anticipation of a more steady transition of power. If the handover of power in North Korea, the world's only communist dynasty, proceeds as envisaged by Kim Jong-il, his son is about to complete a rapid rise to prominence following his public debut in September last year. Then, he was awarded the rank of four-star general and made vice-chairman of the ruling Workers' party of Korea central military commission – a move analysts say was designed to place him at the centre of the country's power structure. Kim Jong-il passed over his first and second sons as potential successors, but there are suggestions that he was never convinced that Kim Jong-un would make a successful leader. Early this year, his eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, told a Japanese newspaper that his father opposed continuing the family dynasty, but had named his youngest brother as heir to maintain stability. In an interview with the Tokyo Shimbun, Kim Jong-nam said that hereditary succession \"does not fit with socialism, and my father was against it as well\". Kim Jong-nam fell out of favour in 2001 after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \"My understanding is that [succession] was to stabilise the internal system,\" he said. \"An unstable North Korea leads to instability in the region.\" In a country that, despite its communist doctrine, retains a Confucian respect for seniority, Kim Jong-un could have expected to give way to his older siblings, but reportedly emerged as his father's favourite after impressing him with his single-mindedness and leadership qualities. Foreign officials are clearly concerned that his accession will create short-term instability. In leaked US embassy cables published by WikiLeaks last November, South Korean analysts warned the assistant secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, of possible instability arising from a botched transfer of power. \"Of the five experts, one thought the younger Kim might succeed and one argued his lack of leadership experience made it unlikely he would win the support of the ruling elites,\" the cables said. They continued: \"They agreed that Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law Jang Song-taek would prove a strong rival for the younger Kim and would probably be tempted to challenge him. \"Kim Jong-il had used draconian controls and international aid to discourage coups after having foiled three such attempts in the late 90s.\" The cables referred to doubts about Kim Jong-un's ability to fend off challenges to his leadership in the event of his father's death. The experts noted that the younger Kim has \"very little experience and might not get much direct guidance before Kim Jong-il dies\". Kim died before he could preside over what promised to be lavish celebrations to mark the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth, a milestone he was to use to declare North Korea a \"strong and prosperous\" state and a bona fide nuclear power. It is appropriate, perhaps, that such an implausible claim will now be left to an equally improbable successor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/07/ftse-reverses-eurozone-worries-icap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-07T17:04:54Z","webTitle":"FTSE reverses gains as eurozone worries return, with Icap leading the fallers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/07/ftse-reverses-eurozone-worries-icap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/dec/07/ftse-reverses-eurozone-worries-icap","fields":{"headline":"FTSE reverses gains as eurozone worries return, with Icap leading the fallers","bodyText":"With markets heading lower after early optimism of a eurozone deal faded, Icap led the FTSE 100 fallers on worries about its future growth. The interdealer broker lost 16.1p to 350.4p after Morgan Stanley moved from overweight to equalweight and cut its target from 575p to 435p. Meanwhile Numis pointed to new figures from the company showing a 7% decline in electronic trading volumes in November. Analyst James Hamilton said: This continues the deteriorating trend with October showing growth of 2%, September 14% and the five months to August 18% growth. Consensus expects profits to be up in the second half on the first. That looks very unlikely. Icap is valued at 10.1 times this year's earnings which is far from compellingly cheap given the negative operating outlook and regulatory risk. We do however believe that there is a good medium term growth story for Icap driven by global growth, integration, financial development and trade. Still with financials, hedge fund group Man fell 3.4p to 139.8p. After the market closed on Tuesday, the company reported a 2.4% weekly fall in net asset value at its key AHL fund. With the uncertainty surrounding the eurozone debt crisis growing again, banks reversed earlier gains. Royal Bank of Scotland ended 0.45p lower at 22.14p and Barclays lost 0.65p to 187.35p. All this helped push the FTSE 100 down 21.81 points to 5546.91, after the index had earlier climbed as high as 5631. Reports that Germany was more pessimistic about a deal at Friday's summit unsettled investors once more, indicating the continuing tensions surrounding the attempts to resolve the current debt crisis. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said: We have started to hear the first real signs of tension between EU leaders and politicians as they prepare to descend upon Brussels for what is fast being labelled as make or break time for the eurozone. Whilst there is every chance that [the German comments] could simply be a PR tactic to downgrade market expectations after a week of optimism building, investors are not taking any chances. This has put a bit of a dampener on the optimism that has driven stock markets higher over the past week and a half and convinced many investors to start locking in their profits in case of a bad disappointment from Brussels if EU leaders fail to agree on fresh measures to contain the crisis. On another bad day for the retail sector - with Blacks Leisure putting itself up for sale and a gloomy update from Kesa Electricals - Burberry stood out with a 10p gain to £12.77. The luxury goods group was boosted by a buy note from Liberum Capital. Analyst Simon Irwin said: After more than a decade of restructuring, the cost of sorting out legacy issues and investment in a growth platform is set to fade as both sales and margins accelerate. Although we are cautious on the macro environment, we forecast average earnings per share growth of 20% over the next four years versus 17.5% over the past five years. As it continues to deliver growth even through a downturn, we believe that Burberry can maintain its recent rating of 20 times PE. Although we have some of the most conservative forecasts in the market we have a twelve month target price of 1535p, giving a 23% return. Meanwhile Blacks lost 50% to 1.875p and Kesa closed 7.55p lower at 74.15p. Despite the uncertainty, mining shares regained some ground, with Randgold Resources rising 235p to £69.45 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, consistently tipped as a takeover target, adding 6p to 682p. One of the day's big risers was IT and software group Micro Focus International, up 21.6p at 403.1p following a better than expected update. The company, which called off talks with private equity firms in the summer because it said bids were too low, plans to return 45p a share in cash to investors. The decision follows the company agreeing a new $275m facility with its banks. Half year profits rose 19.9% to $75.8m, ahead of market forecasts, after it acted to turn around a poor performance in the previous financial year. Analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon kept his buy rating and raised his target price from 425p to 458p. Elsewhere Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide added 0.97p to 17.82p after Gavin Darby, who joined from Vodafone as its new chief executive, bought 2m shares at 16.89p each. Lower down the market Kalahari Minerals climbed 2.5p to 234.5p ahead of Thursday's deadline for potential bidder China Guangdong Nuclear Power to make a formal offer. If it does proceed, analysts believe it may also pounce on associated company Extract Energy. Technology group ANT fell 5.75p to 15.75p after warning of lower than expected revenues and higher losses. The company recently demonstated its new software, which allows consumers to watch live television programmes on IPads and other mobile devices, and received a good reaction in the City. But now it says the tough economic climate has led to delays in its customers shipping products, as well as in closing new licencing agreements. So margins will be down and its cash balance will be marginally below forecasts. Analysts at Arbuthnot cut their target price from 60p to 25p following the update. Finally Mouchel, the troubled support services group which this week announced turnaround specialist David Shearer as its new chairman, lost 0.9p to 9p. Peel Hunt issued a sell note, with analyst Christopher Bamberry saying: Following the amendment to banking facility terms, it is intended that a capital restructuring will take place by July 31 next year. With the appointment of David Shearer, we see potential parallels with recent events at Superglass where the capital restructuring took the form of a heavily discounted equity raise combined with the conversion of a substantial proportion of the bank debt into convertible shares. However, even under a wide range of scenarios we find it difficult to envisage any meaningful value for the existing equity. As a consequence, our share price target is reduced from 5p to 1p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-29T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Worst ever carbon emissions leave climate on the brink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower","fields":{"headline":"Worst ever carbon emissions leave climate on the brink","bodyText":"Greenhouse gas emissions increased by a record amount last year, to the highest carbon output in history, putting hopes of holding global warming to safe levels all but out of reach, according to unpublished estimates from the International Energy Agency. The shock rise means the goal of preventing a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius – which scientists say is the threshold for potentially \"dangerous climate change\" – is likely to be just \"a nice Utopia\", according to Fatih Birol, chief economist of the IEA. It also shows the most serious global recession for 80 years has had only a minimal effect on emissions, contrary to some predictions. Last year, a record 30.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide poured into the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuel – a rise of 1.6Gt on 2009, according to estimates from the IEA regarded as the gold standard for emissions data. \"I am very worried. This is the worst news on emissions,\" Birol told the Guardian. \"It is becoming extremely challenging to remain below 2 degrees. The prospect is getting bleaker. That is what the numbers say.\" Professor Lord Stern of the London School of Economics, the author of the influential Stern Report into the economics of climate change for the Treasury in 2006, warned that if the pattern continued, the results would be dire. \"These figures indicate that [emissions] are now close to being back on a 'business as usual' path. According to the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's] projections, such a path ... would mean around a 50% chance of a rise in global average temperature of more than 4C by 2100,\" he said. \"Such warming would disrupt the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people across the planet, leading to widespread mass migration and conflict. That is a risk any sane person would seek to drastically reduce.\" Birol said disaster could yet be averted, if governments heed the warning. \"If we have bold, decisive and urgent action, very soon, we still have a chance of succeeding,\" he said. The IEA has calculated that if the world is to escape the most damaging effects of global warming, annual energy-related emissions should be no more than 32Gt by 2020. If this year's emissions rise by as much as they did in 2010, that limit will be exceeded nine years ahead of schedule, making it all but impossible to hold warming to a manageable degree. Emissions from energy fell slightly between 2008 and 2009, from 29.3Gt to 29Gt, due to the financial crisis. A small rise was predicted for 2010 as economies recovered, but the scale of the increase has shocked the IEA. \"I was expecting a rebound, but not such a strong one,\" said Birol, who is widely regarded as one of the world's foremost experts on energy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said time was running out. \"This news should shock the world. Yet even now politicians in each of the great powers are eyeing up extraordinary and risky ways to extract the world's last remaining reserves of fossil fuels – even from under the melting ice of the Arctic. You don't put out a fire with gasoline. It will now be up to us to stop them.\" Most of the rise – about three-quarters – has come from developing countries, as rapidly emerging economies have weathered the financial crisis and the recession that has gripped most of the developed world. But he added that, while the emissions data was bad enough news, there were other factors that made it even less likely that the world would meet its greenhouse gas targets. • About 80% of the power stations likely to be in use in 2020 are either already built or under construction, the IEA found. Most of these are fossil fuel power stations unlikely to be taken out of service early, so they will continue to pour out carbon – possibly into the mid-century. The emissions from these stations amount to about 11.2Gt, out of a total of 13.7Gt from the electricity sector. These \"locked-in\" emissions mean savings must be found elsewhere. \"It means the room for manoeuvre is shrinking,\" warned Birol. • Another factor that suggests emissions will continue their climb is the crisis in the nuclear power industry. Following the tsunami damage at Fukushima, Japan and Germany have called a halt to their reactor programmes, and other countries are reconsidering nuclear power. \"People may not like nuclear, but it is one of the major technologies for generating electricity without carbon dioxide,\" said Birol. The gap left by scaling back the world's nuclear ambitions is unlikely to be filled entirely by renewable energy, meaning an increased reliance on fossil fuels. • Added to that, the United Nations-led negotiations on a new global treaty on climate change have stalled. \"The significance of climate change in international policy debates is much less pronounced than it was a few years ago,\" said Birol. He urged governments to take action urgently. \"This should be a wake-up call. A chance [of staying below 2 degrees] would be if we had a legally binding international agreement or major moves on clean energy technologies, energy efficiency and other technologies.\" Governments are to meet next week in Bonn for the next round of the UN talks, but little progress is expected. Sir David King, former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, said the global emissions figures showed that the link between rising GDP and rising emissions had not been broken. \"The only people who will be surprised by this are people who have not been reading the situation properly,\" he said. Forthcoming research led by Sir David will show the west has only managed to reduce emissions by relying on imports from countries such as China. Another telling message from the IEA's estimates is the relatively small effect that the recession – the worst since the 1930s – had on emissions. Initially, the agency had hoped the resulting reduction in emissions could be maintained, helping to give the world a \"breathing space\" and set countries on a low-carbon path. The new estimates suggest that opportunity may have been missed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-11T15:55:59Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake and tsunami: what happened and why","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake and tsunami: what happened and why","bodyText":"What caused the tsunami? The most powerful earthquake recorded in Japanese history, magnitude 8.9. The tremors were the result of a violent uplift of the sea floor 80 miles off the coast of Sendai, where the Pacific tectonic plate slides beneath the plate Japan sits on. Tens of miles of crust ruptured along the trench where the tectonic plates meet. The earthquake occurred at the relatively shallow depth of 15 miles, meaning much of its energy was released at the seafloor. How does the earthquake compare with others? This was the sixth largest earthquake in the world since 1900, when seismological records began. The most devastating earthquake to strike Japan was in 1923, when a magnitude 7.9 tremor devastated Tokyo and Yokohama and killed an estimated 142,800 people. The Kobe earthquake in 1995 was a magnitude 6.9 and caused more than 5,000 deaths and injured 36,000 others. The earthquake that wrecked Christchurch in New Zealand last month was a magnitude 6.3 event. Around 30 times more energy is released as the magnitude of an earthquake increases one unit, for example from magnitude 8 to 9. Why is the area so prone to earthquakes? The Pacific plate moves fast in tectonic terms, at a rate of 9cm (3.5 inches) a year. This leads to the rapid buildup of huge amounts of energy. As the Pacific plate moves down, it sticks to the overhead plate and pulls it down too. Eventually, the join breaks, causing the seafloor to spring upwards several metres. The plate tectonics of the region are complex, and geologists are not sure which plate Japan sits on. Candidates include the Eurasian plate, the North American plate, the Okhotsk plate, and the Honshu microplate. How big were the waves? The largest waves measured by instruments in the water were 7 metres (nearly 23ft) high in the north-east of Japan, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) in Hawaii. Other estimates put the wave height at 10 metres. Waves reached 4 metres around the coast of Japan. As the tsunami spread across the Pacific, the wave height dropped to around 40cm in Guam and the nearby Marianas. The most powerful waves appeared to be moving south-west from Japan. Some countries may experience waves up to 2 metres, according to PTWC forecasts. How much damage has been caused? Japan has invested heavily in coastal protection and buildings that can withstand tremors. Nevertheless, ports were pounded by the tsunami and the airport in Sendai was inundated. Nuclear power plants were shut down across the country and a state of emergency declared at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, where a cooling system failed. Modern buildings in Japan are designed to absorb the violent sideways shaking that can devastate cities. High-rise buildings can still be damaged, but are more likely to remain standing. There are concerns for low-lying islands in the Pacific. How long will the waves take to reach other countries? The tsunami moves across the Pacific at a speed of 500mph, with waves expected to reach the island of Fiji and Cairns in Australia at 3.28pm GMT. From then, waves are due to reach Acapulco in Mexico at 7.59pm, Chile at 10.55pm, Ecuador at 11.31pm, Colombia at 11.47 and Peru at 12.33am. Will there be aftershocks? Regular aftershocks have already hit Japan as the Earth's crust continues to rupture along the Japan trench. Those tremors are expected to be weaker and are less likely to produce another tsunami. The release of energy along the subduction zone between the Pacific and North Atlantic plates will transfer stress to other parts of the faultline, which could easily generate more earthquakes in the region in coming months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/12/eva-joly-run-french-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-12T17:19:22Z","webTitle":"Eva Joly to run for French presidency","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/12/eva-joly-run-french-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/12/eva-joly-run-french-presidency","fields":{"headline":"Eva Joly to run for French presidency","bodyText":"Eva Joly, the ruthless fraud prosecutor who nailed the 1990s corruption scandal at oil company Elf, is to run for French president. Joly stunned France by winning the primary race for France's new expanded environmental party, Greens-Europe-Ecology, beating the favourite, TV presenter Nicolas Hulot, with 58% of the vote against Hulot's 41%. Her score was seen as a victory for her theory of \"combative\" environmentalism. She has promised to attack lobby groups and financial interests and suggested creating an international court for crimes against the environment. She is a fierce advocate of pulling France out of its dependency on nuclear power. The maverick 67-year-old with trademark red glasses is a household name in France. Her pursuit of corruption at the highest reaches of the French elite inspired film director Claude Chabrol's dark thriller A Comedy of Power, where Isabelle Huppert played a vengeful magistrate loosely modelled on Joly. Joly on Tuesday announced: \"Ethics is possible, even at the head of state,\" vowing an end to the corruption scandals still gripping France. Born in a working-class suburb in Norway, she came to Paris as a young au pair to finance her legal studies and ended up marrying the son of the bourgeois family she was posted to, despite their disapproval. She now holds joint Norwegian-French nationality and will be the first dual national to run for the French presidency – a fact she uses in her attacks on the anti-immigration extreme-right. She vowed to be the \"candidate of mixed blood\" and \"a France which doesn't accept discrimination or ghettos\". Joly's Norwegian accent and monotone voice is seen by some as a severe handicap. But she staunchly refuses to take coaching in communications. Indeed, pollsters feel her no-nonsense approach and lack of TV style plays well to a French electorate fed up with spin. Joly is a relative newcomer to politics. She was elected MEP for the Paris region in 2009, before her party Europe Ecology merged with the old Green party, Les Verts, to create a new green movement known by the initials EELV. Membership has soared after good turnouts in regional and local elections. Joly has anchored herself firmly on the left, but she must now come up with a social and economic programme that can convince voters beyond environmental issues and her trademark crusades against high-level corruption. The Greens hope to boost their score to around 10% in the presidential election. Joly is currently personally scoring around 6% in polls. Some key EELV figures, such as Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the MEP and former student leader of May 1968, who supports Joly, have worried about the rise of the extreme right's Marine Le Pen. Cohn-Bendit has warned the Green party should consider ditching its candidate and rallying behind a Socialist party candidate in order to avoid splitting the leftist vote. If the left vote is split, Le Pen could get through to the presidential second round. The EELV party will also position itself as potential future parliamentary allies of the Socialist party if a Socialist wins the presidency. This could see Joly appointed as a minister in a Socialist government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/sep/20/chris-huhne-dash-for-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-20T10:50:16Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne halts 'dash for gas' to keep UK on course for carbon targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/20/chris-huhne-dash-for-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/sep/20/chris-huhne-dash-for-gas","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne halts 'dash for gas' to keep UK on course for carbon targets","bodyText":"The UK's \"dash for gas\" will be halted by the government because if unchecked it would break legally binding targets for carbon dioxide emissions, Chris Huhne, energy and climate change secretary, said on Monday evening. \"We will not consent so much gas plant so as to endanger our carbon dioxide goals,\" he told a fringe meeting at the Liberal Democrats party conference in Birmingham. The number of gas-fuelled power plants is increasing rapidly because they are fast and cheap to build compared with alternatives. They also create about half the carbon emissions of coal-powered plants and have been seen as a \"transition fuel\", helping smooth the path to zero-carbon electricity. Barry Neville, director of public affairs at Centrica, which owns British Gas, said: \"Gas is a critical part of the fuel mix, it's a transition fuel. At this moment in time it is crucial to the UK, as is nuclear and as are renewables. But climate change campaigners have warned that too much gas capacity is being built, meaning either the carbon budgets intended to help tackle global warming would be broken, or the gas plants would be left as stranded assets. \"The secretary of state's statement is a welcome recognition by the government that there are constraints on the deployment of gas as a climate-effective solution to our future energy needs,\" said David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF UK. \"The government should be looking at the deployment of renewables, that already must be at 30% by 2020, at increasing rates during the 2020s.\" But David Porter, chief executive of the Association of Electricity Producers, said: \"Electricity produced from gas is important for security of electricity supply. Gas-fired power stations offer flexible, reliable electricity, which is vital as we increase our renewable electricity production and prepare for new nuclear power. Unabated gas will play an important role in the transition to a low carbon electricity industry. We must keep the lights on and do so cost-effectively. That means providing clarity for investors - we are not quite there yet.\" In 2010, there was about 27 gigawatts of gas power capacity in the UK, with 4GW of new plant under construction, and 8 GW having been given planning permission. The installed capacity of all types of electricity generation is 75GW. In 2018, National Grid predicts there will be around 45 GW of gas plant on the system. An analysis by the Green Alliance in June of the consequences of the dash for gas, showed that even if 4GW of planned capacity was never built by 2030,16GW of gas capacity would still be \"stranded\" – built at a capital cost of £10bn but not used for its planned lifespan because of the need to meet carbon targets. In that scenario, 8GW of the capacity in use would require carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) to be fitted to meet carbon targets. The coalition government has committed to building demonstration plants to develop CCS, but no contracts have yet been awarded. Huhne said he saw a potentially large role for gas power plants fitted with CCS. \"If the gas price tends towards that in the US, I would expect to see lots of abated gas. It could be the cheapest form of low-carbon energy.\" Some in the energy industry have criticised the lack of certainty over which technologies would be backed by government through its electricity market reforms. But Huhne said: \"It is essential to have the ability to bend and respond\" to both changes in the costs of low-carbon technologies and the gas price. Gas prices have risen sharply for UK household in recent months and on Monday Huhne pledged to make it easier for consumers to get a better deal from the \"big six\" energy companies that deliver 99% of the UK's electricity. But globally gas price rises have been curbed by increasing supplies of unconventional gas, driven from shale by hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking. Exploration has begun in the UK near Blackpool in Lancashire and has attracted protests but Huhne said no new regulation of fracking was needed, despite controversies about its safety elsewhere. \"I recommend you look at the film Gasland, which is a bit of a wake-up call,\" Huhne said. \"There are some extremely alarming pictures of people setting fire to their taps because of methane gas bubbling up.\" He said the problem in US was because gas fracking had been exempted from clean water regulations by the then vice president Dick Cheney. \"We have not exempted fracking from any environmental regulations in this country and we do not intend to. I am confident that our environmental regulations are strong,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/27/huhne-renewable-energy-green-growth-deniers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-27T09:30:00Z","webTitle":"How to solve 'green growth denial' in one stroke | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/27/huhne-renewable-energy-green-growth-deniers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/27/huhne-renewable-energy-green-growth-deniers","fields":{"headline":"How to solve 'green growth denial' in one stroke","bodyText":"It feels good to get something off your chest. And that's just what Chris Huhne did on Wednesday with his blast against \"green growth deniers\". But even Huhne, frequently direct to the point of bluntness, stopped short of naming those deniers. So I'll do it for him. And, later on, I'll tell him how to solve the problem he faces at a stroke. The energy and climate change secretary was speaking in Manchester, the home of the first industrial revolution, and argued that renewable energy will deliver a new industrial revolution for Britain. \"Yes, the UK is only 2% of global carbon emissions. But if we grasp the opportunity now our businesses and economy can be much more than 2% of the solution,\" he said. That is direct riposte the Chancellor George \"Goldfinger\" Osborne, who told the Conservative party conference: \"Britain makes up less than 2% of the world's carbon emissions to China and America's 40%. We're not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.\" Huhne was on form, railing against \"faultfinders and curmudgeons who hold forth on the impossibility of renewables – the unholy alliance of climate sceptics and armchair engineers who are selling Britain's ingenuity short.\" He specifically targeted those puffed up by the ludicrous hype over the UK's fledgling shale gas find: \"Unconventional gas has not yet lit a single room nor cooked a single roast dinner in the UK. Yet those who clamour loudest for \"realistic\" energy policies would have us hitch our wagon to shale alone.\" Yes, Dieter Helm, he's talking to you. The speech is worth a read as it tackles three renewables \"myths\" head on. First, the myth that renewables are uneconomic and held up by government cash alone. In fact, more than 70% of global renewables investment in 2010 was private finance. Furthermore, said Huhne: \"Globally, subsidies for fossil fuels outstrip subsidies for renewables by a factor of five.\" Another analysis suggests a factor 12. Second myth: renewables cannot deliver secure power at scale. Not so, says Huhne, citing the fossil-fuel focused International Energy Agency which says diverse energy sources increase security. As for intermittency, Coronation Street ad breaks and broken-down nuclear power stations mean the UK knows how to deal with this. Third myth: people don't want renewables. Again, not so, says Huhne, citing an Ipsos MORI poll asking for UK views on wind (82% favourable) and gas (56%). Huhne is winning plenty of battles in the government (the green deal, the green investment bank, renewable heat and so on), but he's not winning the war. When he said in his speech, \"I know the prime minister agrees,\" he highlighted the problem. He may know this, but we don't. More importantly all those investors already creating thousands of green jobs, and who could create more, don't either. As the Confederation of British Industry – scarcely treehuggers – said in response to Huhne's speech: \"We need to ensure that global low-carbon investors choose the UK as a place to do business, which requires certainty in both policy and language.\" Ben Warren, at Ernst and Young, agreed: \"In the longer term a more strategic view from government is desperately needed to ... help overcome the short-term outlook coming from Treasury.\" Osborne is cutting investment in clean energy while giving handouts to highly polluting businesses, pandering to the delusions of the green growth deniers. Take the misleadingly named Renewable Energy Foundation, whose director John Constable, said: \"Corporate welfare on this scale is actually counter-productive, since it provides no incentive for the green industries to grow up, drive down costs and improve technologies.\" So where's Constable's call to abandon the far greater fossil fuels subsidies? Others say the Chancellor is simply arguing for \"cost-effective\" carbon reduction policies. Who is in favour of non-cost-effective policies? The problem is Osborne is talking about reducing the ambition, not deploying the same funds in a different way. The immediate cause of the Conservative's abandoning of their detoxifying green zeal is soaring domestic energy bills. This political kryptonite has been relentlessly and inaccurately pinned on green taxes, with the Daily Mail the prime offender. But the urgent investment needed in our energy infrastructure results from the unusually liberal energy market the UK has had for the past two decades. It kept bills low when cheap North Sea gas was flowing freely, but has given no incentive to invest for the future, when gas prices have soared. So rebuilding the UK's energy infrastructure is a national investment in our future prosperity, and choosing anything other than clean, secure and inexhaustible sources would be madness. For that reason, the funding to get the industry on its feet should come from general taxation, not a levy on fuel bills that hits the poorest hardest. The government already chose this option for the £1bn for a carbon capture and storage demonstration plant. By not making energy bill payers stump up for the failings of past policies, the government in a single stroke draws the sting that is poisoning this vital issue. But if you don't like that and are still worried about your household budget, I have another suggestion that will save you far more money than the actual green levies on your energy bills: stop buying the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. You'll be £263 a year better off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/aug/30/gazprom-quarterly-profits-16bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-30T16:04:17Z","webTitle":"Gazprom reports quarterly profits of $16bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/30/gazprom-quarterly-profits-16bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/aug/30/gazprom-quarterly-profits-16bn","fields":{"headline":"Gazprom reports quarterly profits of $16bn","bodyText":"Gazprom showed why ExxonMobil wants to enter the Russian resources market on Tuesday when it reported one of the biggest quarterly profits in corporate history. The energy group posted earnings of $16bn (£10bn) in the three months to the end of March – up 44% on the same period in 2010 – powered by sky-high energy prices and a surge in orders from customers locking into deals for fear that rates would later rise even more steeply. But despite the high prices charged by Gazprom, the oil price, which is closely linked to the cost of gas, has fallen back from its April peak of about $125 a barrel to $111. Analysts doubted whether Gazprom, Russia's largest company, would perform as well during the rest of the year as the global economy begins to cool and price growth is potentially curtailed by the restoration of supplies from war-torn Libya. Rhys Kealley at Datamonitor said: \"Choking your customers to death is not good for long-term profits – Gazprom realise this and are in talks with customers such as Germany's RWE, which is desperately in need of cheaper gas in light of Germany's move away from nuclear power.\" Chirvani Abdoullaev, an analyst at Wood &amp; Co, said: \"These are fantastic results for Gazprom, but could represent the peak for 2011, partly due to the high volumes of gas already purchased by the company's customers.\" The value of sales to countries belonging to the former Soviet Union showed the most impressive gain, with an advance of nearly 120%. The European market, which accounts for a quarter of Gazprom's business, recorded a sales gain of 40%. In Russia itself, net sales advanced by 14%. Average prices charged by Gazprom for gas pumped to European and other non-ex-Soviet customers increased by 14% in the period, with a rise in volumes sold of 12%. The results mean that Gazprom is already well on the way to topping its record annual performance in 2010, when it posted the biggest profits in its history, at $35bn. According to analysts at VTB Capital, the quarterly numbers were boosted not only by price rises but by a revival in European gas demand during an unusually severe winter. Gazprom controls one-fifth of world gas reserves and provides for one-sixth of global gas production. In Britain, it accounts for just 2% of gas consumption, but it has a growing operation that sells to large UK companies. According to the research organisation Datamonitor, the Russian group has a 10% share of the business market, selling to the likes of Bhs and Chelsea football club. It has more than 100 UK corporate customers, including producers of steel, cement, glass and pharmaceuticals. There have been reports of British rivals complaining that they have not been able to compete because the prices being offered by Gazprom are so low. Gazprom has been in the British market since 2006, but it is only in the past year that it has been propelled into the ranks of a handful of market leaders such as Shell Gas Direct, E.ON, Statoil, British Gas and Total Gas &amp; Power. Its dramatic expansion will cause alarm in some government circles, amid concern over a Russian state-owned company controlling the gas supply of important British companies. Founded in 1989, Gazprom grew out of the USSR's Gas Industry Ministry and was part-privatised from 1993 in the much-criticised sale of state assets in post-Soviet Russia. The Russian government has retained a controlling stake of just over 50%, according to the company's website, and Gazprom is now a cornerstone of the modern state. But the company was criticised for its role in the 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas crisis, which led to major supply cuts for European consumers; it has also been lambasted in the west over its close ties to the Russian political leadership. President Dmitry Medvedev once served as Gazprom board chairman and several of its top executives have links to Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin. Europe remains by far Gazprom's most important market but it is also trying to diversify exports beyond the EU and the former Soviet Union and is hoping to sign a huge gas sales contract with China. However, the two sides have yet to clinch a final contract amid reported differences over pricing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2012/mar/13/guardian-weekly-letters-16-march","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-13T12:59:01Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 16 March 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/mar/13/guardian-weekly-letters-16-march","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2012/mar/13/guardian-weekly-letters-16-march","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 16 March 2012","bodyText":"I have just read your article about the killings of Americans who are supposedly training Afghan soldiers and advising in the various ministries in Kabul (Future of Afghan mission questioned, 2 March). I hope that these disasters will finally persuade the US government that the whole Afghanistan adventure was misconceived. Every day we read comments from the US government talking about bringing \"freedom and democracy\" to Afghanistan. Supposedly this is the reason why we have remained there after defeating al-Qaida. This is a delusion. It is amazing that the US has not learned anything from the history of Afghanistan. The British fought three disastrous wars there, and in one of them, lost a whole army trying to leave the country. Later the Russians were also humiliated. Notwithstanding this history, the US government still has fantasies about leaving a \"free\" and \"democratic\" state in Afghanistan while training the Afghan army to resist the Taliban. The Afghans have never been united under one central government; their allegiance is to multiple tribes, and for centuries they have shared one common purpose: keeping foreigners out. How long can this fantasy continue? How long can the misery of the Afghan people be prolonged by our illusions about American power and purposes? Rodney Barker Newton, Massachusetts, US An act of stupidity Seumas Milne says that Attacking Iran would be an act of stupidity (2 March). Probably. Unfortunately, it may also be an act of political expedience. Obama does indeed have every interest in heading off an Israeli attack, at least until after the elections. Binyamin Netanyahu, however, has every interest in setting off such an attack, preferably just before Israeli elections. He would much rather any of the Republicans were in the White House, no matter how toothless the Obama administration has been towards the Israeli government. In the event of an Israeli attack, the US will either not join in and Obama will be portrayed as spineless, therefore losing the elections; or the US will join in and be locked into another endless war, having to protect Israel for years. And Obama will still risk losing the election. Win-win for the leadership in Tel Aviv. Then, more likely than not, Israel's Arab neighbourhood will go up in flames as Iran retaliates and the whole region gets dragged into war, which will quickly be followed by sectarian strife in several if not all countries, and if things get really bad tensions might escalate between Arab states themselves. Which is fine by Israel as it does not trust them one iota, no matter how American their growing weapons stockpile might be. It would be a dangerous gambit on the part of Netanyahu, but Israel is a survivor and it has less to lose than Washington and Europe. Adding to this, a turbulent Middle East might keep Israel free from neighbours becoming powerful enough to be threatening for years to come and guarantee another win when it is Netanyahu's turn at the ballots. One man's act of stupidity might be another one's coup. S Nogueira Brussels, Belgium • Matthew Kroenig is quoted as saying that a nuclear Iran \"would immediately limit US freedom of action in the Middle East\", that is, create a counterforce against US and Israeli domination. That seems right, just as a nuclear Israel has provided freedom to pursue aggressive actions with impunity since the 1960s against its Arab neighbours. A nuclear Iran could inspire Israel to get serious about negotiations with the Palestinians and Arab states. Israel would then have reason to accept past Arab League offers of peace were it to accept a Palestinian state and return of Syrian lands. Baylis Thomas New York City, US Empowering the poor I was saddened to see Bill Gates spending $200m on technical fixes for small farmers (Gates pledges $200m for small farmers, 2 March), instead of using his money to support Vandana Shiva and people like her working with poor communities around the world. I suppose it might have been worse: Gates could have given even more money towards a mindset that ignores the warnings of Olivier De Schutters, the UN special rapporteur, that empowerment of the poor is needed rather than imposition of the Monsanto corporate model for controlling seed. There is more than just hope that sustainable ways to feed the world can be found. The UN report on the right to food shows food production in the developing world can double in 10 years using climate-smart agro-ecological systems that are ready to go. These techniques are light years away from where Gates's philanthropy or global agribusiness would take the world. Perhaps India's Manmohan Singh (Indian PM blames NGOs for nuclear power delays, 2 March) will also be reassured that it is his own farmers that are opposing contamination of their system, rather than US NGOs, as he seems to believe. Jon Carapiet Auckland, New Zealand Enthusiastic waiters It was a really interesting metaphor that the bankers chose to use in Joris Luyendijk's Just doing their jobs (24 February): they chose to see themselves as \"overenthusiastic waiters\" in an effort to lay culpability for the global financial crisis with customers asking for a loan. To take this metaphor further I can imagine waiters of such calibre when approached by an alcoholic, offering a bottle of whisky saying, \"Go on sir, you know you want to; don't worry about the cash, I'll put it on your slate.\" The waiter's boss would then take him aside with regard to such gross irresponsibility and reassure him that his share of the tips jar would be distributed as normal, and to try not to worry. Should the licensing authorities have the temerity to ask any awkward questions as to their conduct once word got out, they would whine about how unfair it all was and threaten to shut the bar and reopen in an offshore tax haven somewhere, where people wouldn't be so horribly mean. If that's the way that the metaphor extends itself, then perhaps I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing with bankers in thinking that it's an accurate and entirely appropriate one. Gary Laidlaw Norwich, UK The death of the letter I grow weary of hearing the death of letter-writing foretold as the inevitable result of email (The stamp of history, 2 March). I find email invaluable as a means of delivering my letters to friends – letters that are written in the traditional form, starting with \"Dear (whoever)\", and ending with \"Love, Kate\". In between, I talk about what's happening in my life, maybe attach a photo or two, enquire after my friends' health and wellbeing, and sometimes make arrangements – all the things I used to do in handwritten letters. The difference is that I no longer have the expense and inconvenience of buying a stamp and going out to a postbox. And, even more important, I can confidently expect it to arrive, and in a very short time. For many years I have had friends in out-of-the-way places, and I can assure Kathryn Hughes that posting a letter to Mozambique, Ethiopia or Sudan always felt like the ultimate act of faith. Even if it managed to get to its destination, it could take several weeks. Then, of course, when you replied to the news in their reply, it could well be already out of date. For communicating short messages, most of us used postcards – in those days they usually arrived. Nowadays I use emails for this as well, but for a proper chat – the phone. As a historian, Hughes must be aware that in 1840 many people in this country were illiterate, thus letters could not provide an insight into their lives, for later generations. And, of course, the vast majority of letters did not survive. Most letters are not written for the benefit of historians.

The Conservatives are in favour of building new nuclear reactors, and the Liberal Democrats are against. Simon Hughes, previously the Liberal Democrats' energy spokesman, has said: \"A new generation of nuclear power stations will be a colossal mistake, regardless of where they are built. They are hugely expensive, dangerous and will take too long to build.\" The Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg reiterated a similar line in the leaders' debates. In a statement today, the coalition said: \"We have agreed a process that will allow Liberal Democrats to maintain their opposition to nuclear power while permitting the government to bring forward the national planning statement for ratification by parliament so that new nuclear construction becomes possible.\" Under this arrangement, we will have the odd experience of a Liberal Democrat speaking against his or her own government's planning statement for nuclear power. Lib Dem MPs will then abstain. Martyn Williams, Friends of the Earth's (FoE) senior parliamentary campaigner, said the high cost made a new fleet of nuclear power stations unlikely. \"The Conservatives I've spoken to are clear no public money will go into nuclear, and have even discussed whether that promise should be set down in law. And because the Liberal Democrats will abstain on nuclear, the Conservatives will be a minority government on nuclear.\" Global climate talks Both parties are committed to pursuing a global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But their differing enthusiasm for Europe, particularly the Eurosceptic MPs to the right of the Conservative party (not least Hague), may cause rifts over whether to back European negotiating positions. Carbon cuts The Liberal Democrats have proposed a 40% cut in carbon emissions by 2020, going deeper than the 34% advised by the government's independent advisory body under the Climate Change Act of 2008. The Tories support the 34% target though they did not explicitly mention it in their manifesto. It's not yet clear whether the new government will settle on a higher figure, such as the 42% cut recommended by campaigners. Alex Randall, a spokeman for the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) said the Liberal Democrats had been more aggressive in their plans for cutting carbon emissions and that it would be significant if a Lib Dem was appointed as minister for energy and climate change. Aviation and transport Both parties oppose Heathrow expansion and agree on the need to develop high-speed rail. Plans for a third runway at Heathrow will be formally shelved. Williams said there was still a question mark over whether the new government would allow or oppose expansion at other airports. The Lib Dems oppose such expansion but the Tories left the door open to more airport capacity. Both today ruled out additional runways at Gatwick and Stansted. The new government is also backing a Lib Dem policy of replacing air passenger duty with a per flight duty, which means empty planes are taxed as highly as full ones. Both parties are keen on electric cars and today announced they will develop a national charging network. The Liberal Democrats also proposed swapping vehicle excise duty for a road pricing scheme, though Williams said this now looks unlikely to be a policy adopted by the new government. Conservation The Tories have proposed \"conservation credits\", a scheme under which developers must pay for damage done to the environment that funds for improvements elsewhere. The Lib Dems have called for a new status for \"locally important\" areas. It is not clear yet which, if either of these policies, will be prioritised. Today's agreement between the parties does promise \"measures to promote green spaces and wildlife corridors in order to halt the loss of habitats and restore biodiversity.\" Renewable energy Both parties back more investment in \"clean energy\". The Conservatives have been very clear that they will not back specific low-carbon technologies, but will leave the market to decide. Greg Clark, formerly the shadow climate secretary, wrote recently on environmenttheguardian.com: \"Having set the right incentives, government then needs to realise that it is the creative interactions of millions of investors, producers and consumers that will truly create the low-carbon economy.\" The Liberal Democrats have more explicitly backed wind power - using the Guardian's national carbon calculator, they suggested an energy mix featuring 15,000 new wind turbines. The CAT's Randall said the two parties had distinctly different priorities on low-carbon technologies. \"The Conservatives have always favoured a combination of high-tech plus microgeneration - nuclear and carbon capture and storage, plus lots of domestic generation. The Lib Dems have favoured an approach using existing technologies, such as rolling out onshore and offshore wind to a much greater extent, as well as reducing energy demand. It will be interesting to see which approach wins out.\" 10:10 climate campaign The new government today appeared to have signed up to the principle of the 10:10 climate campaign, which calls for individuals and organisations to cut carbon emissions by 10% in 2010. In a statement, it promised a \"commitment to reduce central government carbon emissions by 10% within 12 months.\" Both the Tories and the Lib Dems last year called for the government to sign up to the campaign, but it was defeated by Labour. Green investment bank Like Labour, both the parties support the idea of a green investment bank to finance new low-carbon energy developments. Today's coalition agreement confirms the bank will go ahead, but the key unknown is where the financing will come from. When former chancellor Alistair Darling announced plans for such a bank in the last budget, he said it would have £2bn funding, with £1bn from the government through the sale of the Channel Tunnel and the other £1bn from the private sector. The Lib Dems had promised a £3.1bn green economic stimulus in their manifesto, but it remains to be seen how much money the coalition will put into a green bank and how much slack private investors will pick up. Green homes Both sides of the coalition have proposed grants and schemes to help householders green their homes. Today's coalition agreement green lights a \"pay as you save\" green loan scheme which Labour announced earlier this year and continuing the feed-in tariff for microgenerators of green electricity, which launched in April. The Lib Dems also support the feed-in tariff and in their manifesto proposed a £400 cashback for double glazing, efficient boilers and solar panels. \"Will these things feature in first Queen's speech?\" Williams asked. \"It's a question of whether the coalition prioritise energy and climate. Most of the ministers I've spoken to have been on the environment side and they say it will be, though that doesn't yet prove it will be. Cameron, for example, didn't mention environment in his speech outside of Downing Street last night.\" Both the new PM and his deputy, however, mentioned the environment in their first press conference today. Clegg said this is a government where \"fine words on the environment are finally translated into real action\" and Cameron said it was \"passionate about building a green economy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/16/fukushima-heroes-nuclear-japan-watches","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T18:06:00Z","webTitle":"'Fukushima heroes' battle to tame nuclear plant as Japan watches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/fukushima-heroes-nuclear-japan-watches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/16/fukushima-heroes-nuclear-japan-watches","fields":{"headline":"'Fukushima heroes' battle to tame nuclear plant as Japan watches","bodyText":"The men and women struggling to avert disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant are becoming the faceless heroes of the worst nuclear industry crisis in Japan's history. The 70 or so technicians and engineers, known as the Fukushima 50, have been working under the constant threat of radiation sickness, fires and explosions since they became the sole occupants of an area that has become a no-go zone for tens of thousands of petrified residents. With more than 700 of their colleagues pulled out to safety, the workers are fighting a lonely battle on several fronts in the war against nuclear meltdown. Their workload is heavy, but the weight of expectation, in Japan and around the world, is greater still. For all their bravery, little is known about the workers themselves. Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] has released few details of its elite team, other than those pertaining to the task ahead: to cool overheating reactors and storage pools, and avert disaster. They are working in hot, cramped conditions, clad in white, full-body jumpsuits and working in shifts to prevent contamination and exhaustion. They are equipped with respirators and torches, and when radiation doses rise tohazardous levels, as they did on Wednesday morning, they must be ready to take refuge in safer areas of the complex. The operation has already taken its toll. Eleven people, including members of the Japan Self-Defence Forces, were injured in a hydrogen explosion at its No 3 reactor. Other nuclear power employees, as well as the wider population, can only look on in admiration. \"The people working at these plants are fighting without running away,\" Michiko Otsuki, an employee at the nearby Fukushima Daini plant, wrote on the Japanese social networking site Mixi. \"Please don't forget that there are people who are working to protect everyone's lives in exchange for their own.\" The prime minister, Naoto Kan, who has reportedly criticised Tepco executives for their handling of the crisis, has only praise for their employees. They are \"doing their utmost\", Kan said, \"even at this moment, without even thinking twice about the dangers\". For as long as the workers remain inside the plant they will mitigate the substantial risks to their health by \"dose sharing\" – or splitting their time between areas of high and low levels of radioactivity – according to Dr Ian Haslam, head of radiation protection at the University of Leeds. But abandoning the operation could spell disaster, he said. \"They need to be at the plant to take the measures to keep it under control. \"If you let it go, it will get hotter and hotter, there's a risk of fire, and you're changing from this present rate of release, which is worrying but at a relatively low risk, to something that becomes a higher risk both now and in the future.\" Most can only speculate about the conditions under which they are working. Andriy Chudinov, one of the first workers to enter the Chernobyl power plant in 1986, said his Japanese counterparts were, if anything, even more courageous. \"These are good guys,\" he said. \"After all, they have had it even worse than we did. They had a tsunami first and now there are several reactors with problems. That's a nightmare for any atomic worker.\" David Brenner, the director of radiological research at Columbia Service, pointed to the significant risks the workers are taking with their health. \"In many ways they are already heroes,\" he told the BBC World Service. \"[They] are going to be suffering very high radiation exposures.\" Meanwhile, 500 bone marrow transplant centres across 27 European countries have been put on alert to treat nuclear power station workers whose lives may be threatened in the battle to avoid a meltdown. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation offered to treat 200 to 300 patients if necessary. \"After a person has been radiated, you have three to four days before they're on the cusp of severe complications,\" said Ray Powles, chair of its nuclear accident committee. \"At that point, they could be put on a flight to Europe if Japanese facilities are overwhelmed.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/06/no-definitive-answers-nuclear-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T23:05:05Z","webTitle":"Letters: No definitive answers in the nuclear debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/06/no-definitive-answers-nuclear-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/06/no-definitive-answers-nuclear-debate","fields":{"headline":"No definitive answers in the nuclear debate","bodyText":"George Monbiot is, at best, confused about debates over nuclear power (The unpalatable truth is that the anti-nuclear lobby has misled us all, 5 April).

The issues themselves remain unaffected by noisy media personalities conspicuously recanting professed earlier \"mistaken\" beliefs – often disingenuously and repeatedly over many years. There have always been leading protagonists on all sides who preferred self-referential rhetorical gymnastics to substantiated evidence. Whether on issues around radiation and health or alternative energy futures, the truth is that \"evidence-based\" \"sound science\" does not definitively compel any single interpretation. Peer-reviewed data, rigorous analysis and reasoned scepticism are all essential. But the cause of science is actually undermined by presenting it – without any mention of uncertainty – as if it offers some final incontestable solution. Complexities, uncertainties, ambiguities and legitimate differences of perspective all admit equally valid interpretations of the relevant \"best available\" knowledge. The point is that both nuclear-based or fully renewable global futures are each physically possible, technologically feasible, and potentially economically viable. Despite the constraints, our societies face real – and potentially irreversible – choices. The real \"fairytale\" is to treat this as simplistic contention between scientifically \"right\" and \"wrong\".

So muted was the reaction to Moody's message of riskier times ahead that the ratings agency's cut to AA3 barely registered on world markets. Japan is strangely disconnected from the world financial system given its size, mainly because the Japanese themselves own so much of their own debt (about 95%) and many of the shares in Tokyo-listed corporations. This wraps the country in a soft insulation blanket that in turn absorbs the impact of attacks by foreign investors. What cannot be disguised is the unhealthy state of Japan's economy. As in much of Europe, welfare demands are growing as sources of income are drying up. Big firms refuse to pay high wages and are moving jobs abroad. Lower profits over the last three years have also cut corporate tax receipts. With a post-tsunami reconstruction plan to pay for and an ageing middle class reluctant to pick up the tab, the government plans to borrow even more cash, despite debt as a proportion of GDP already standing at about 200%. Moody's singled out the inability of politicians to make decisions as the main reason for the downgrade. Japan will soon elect its sixth leader in five years to replace the unpopular prime minister, Naoto Kan, who is under fire for his handling of the response to the tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster. A poll found Kan's approval ratings slipping to a new low of 15.8% at the weekend. Kan is undoubtedly a novel character in Japanese politics. A product of civic grassroots movements rather than party machines, he came to prominence as health minister during 1996 when he took sides against the government bureaucracy when it denied responsibility for HIV-tainted blood. However, his suspicion of civil servants was his undoing when he tried to bypass them following the tsunami and pull together a rescue operation almost single-handed. Kan's frustration during 14 months in the top job has only increased as the yen has strengthened, making exports more expensive and tax increases, which he favours, a distant prospect. The end result is that Japan remains one of the biggest losers from the financial crisis with GDP still 5% below its 2007 level. Some Japanese pundits believe the dysfunctional nature of the country's democracy has reached a new low and the parliament is unlikely to get a grip on government finances until the markets refuse to lend any more money. With ordinary households unlikely to use their savings to buy more debt, foreign investors will play a greater role. Digging for gold Which brings us neatly to the European debt crisis, which took a new twist yesterday when the Austrians said they wanted a cash deposit from the Greeks before agreeing to further EU loans. To be fair, the Austrian message was a little more nuanced. The argument ran that a deal last week between Athens and Finland that will oblige the Greeks to deposit cash in a Helsinki bank account should be scrapped or Austria be given the same terms. Austria set out its argument a day after the vice-chairman of Angela Merkel's CDU party argued the Germans should go further and demand Athens stump up gold as an insurance policy against the prospect of a default. Officially, the Netherlands, Germany and other rich eurozone countries oppose the deal, since it would be financed through Greece's €109bn bailout. However, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Slovakia have indicated behind the scenes that they would like a similar side deal with Athens (without specifying a preference for gold or cash). This manoeuvring shows the burghers of Amsterdam, Ljubljana and Bratislava fear that a second bailout for Greece will fail. No wonder Greek borrowing costs went back to record levels on Wednesday night. Ireland, on the other hand, is quietly growing its way out of trouble. A €4bn trade surplus in June was its highest on record, and something to make Portugal and Greece salivate. Exports were up 5.6% on 2010. Sales to the US jumped 11.8% to €9bn. But there can be only one Ireland; not everyone can cut corporation taxes to 12.5% (or less if the company is Google). If they did, Ireland's attraction would evaporate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/30/wind-farms-less-controversial-blackouts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-30T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Support windfarms?

It would be less controversial to argue for blackouts","bodyText":"Why do those who oppose wind power insist on spoiling their case with gibberish? In his column on Friday, Simon Jenkins claimed that onshore windfarms were being planned \"with no concern for cost\". But the only reason for building them is a concern for cost. If it weren't for this issue, they would be the last option governments would choose – God knows they cause enough trouble. As the government's Committee on Climate Change reports, large onshore windfarms are \"already close to competitive\" with burning natural gas, and are likely to get there by 2020. They are the cheapest renewable sources in this country by a long way. Offshore wind costs roughly twice as much, and its costs have been escalating. After attacking the high cost of wind power, Jenkins argued that we should instead invest in \"sun and waves\". The committee shows that while the expected price of electricity from onshore wind in 2030 is between 7 and 8.5 pence per kilowatt hour, solar power is expected to come in at between 11 and 25p, and wave between 15 and 31p. Talk about no concern for cost! Incidentally, the cheapest low carbon option, the committee says, is nuclear power, at 5-10p. But, because of public objections, new plants are likely to be confined to existing sites, which means a maximum of about 20 gigawatts (a quarter of our current power capacity). Planning objections also restrict the spread of onshore wind. The only viable means of getting carbon off the grid, the committee suggests, is a mixture of sources: renewables, nuclear and carbon capture and storage. But those who oppose wind power can't help themselves. In parliament earlier this month, Glyn Davies, the MP who is leading the fight against windfarms in mid-Wales, insisted that \"Welsh windfarms have a load factor of just 19% – the lowest ever recorded\" and that \"the carbon impact of the development can never be compensated for by any possible carbon benefit\". Rubbish again. The capacity factor for Welsh wind (the amount the turbines produce as a proportion of their idealised output) is 26%. Professor Gareth Harrison of Edinburgh University estimates that the carbon payback time for the wind developments in mid-Wales will be roughly 12 months (all references on my website). Davies, like Jenkins, also claimed that \"so much more\" could have been done with the same money had it been spent on wave and tidal power, offshore wind and solar photovoltaics. Should MPs not be obliged to do some research before they open their mouths in parliament? Anti-wind campaigners are also highly selective. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, obsessed by windfarms, says nothing about the opencast coalmines ripping south Wales apart. Nor do you hear a word about the destruction of the ecosystems of upland Wales (and England and Scotland) by sheep grazing. These champions of the countryside want to save it from only one threat. For all that, it's a real one. While the windfarms themselves divide communities, everyone hates the new power lines required to connect them to the grid. Here in mid-Wales, I have yet to meet anyone who will speak up in favour of them. Because they have to march across so much countryside, their visual impact is greater per pound of investment than that of any other technology. Though you could see this issue coming as clearly as the pylons themselves, the green movement is completely unprepared. Greenpeace tells me \"we haven't done any work on pylons\". Hardly anyone seems to be aware of how perilous this situation is: how easily renewable energy could be killed by the power lines issue. This is about to become a national struggle, in which opponents of the new pylons will be cast as heroes. Promising direct action, reminding us of the great battles against the reservoirs supplying England, those who marched against the new lines in Wales last week will put us, unless we act quickly, in a dangerous position. Green activists will be outflanked by green activism. The same battle will then be fought all over the United Kingdom, wherever a new power line is planned. Many of the areas affected by proposals for new lines are either Tory constituencies or Lib Dem seats the Tories will hope to take (all of which are now contestable). It is hard to believe that the Conservative commitment to low-carbon energy could withstand a major rebellion within the party: Tory environmentalism is easily uprooted. The greens need to decide where they stand. The only position that makes sense to me is unequivocally to support the campaign against overhead lines. Where new powerlines are built they must go underground. If they can't go underground, they shouldn't be built. If we are not against pylons marching over stunning countryside, what are we for? But here too there's a problem. Like the windfarms, overhead lines are favoured by the government because of its concern for cost. According to the National Grid, burying the lines connecting the turbines in mid-Wales to the rest of the system would cost 3.2 times as much as putting them on pylons (£562m vs £178m). But how much does that add to the cost of electricity? Calculating this is easy (there's an explanation on my website) – as long as you know the capital costs of the whole project. But neither the National Grid nor anyone else I've spoken to is prepared to hazard a guess about the cost of the rest of the infrastructure, so I can't yet tell you whether burying the power lines makes onshore wind here more expensive than competing technologies. In fact my efforts to obtain relevant data of all kinds from the government, the National Grid and the wind industry reveal that, like the environment movement, they are completely unprepared for this backlash. Dismayed by the collective failure to address the pylons issue, the campaign against windfarms now confidently tells the same story about this technology as others do about nuclear: the turbines are erected by big, greedy corporations; they are unfairly subsidised by the government; they will cause untold damage to human health. In view of the flack you get for supporting any power technology, I'm beginning to think it would be less controversial to argue in favour of blackouts. So this is where the United Kingdom stands. We cannot keep burning fossil fuels without cooking the biosphere. We don't like nuclear power. We don't like onshore wind. We won't like the costs of the other technologies. We reject all the means by which electricity is generated. Yet no one is volunteering to stop using it. • A fully referenced version of this article can be found on George Monbiot's website"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/15/shingle-plan-dungeness","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-15T00:06:00Z","webTitle":"Dungeness's strange beauty under threat from shingle plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/15/shingle-plan-dungeness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/15/shingle-plan-dungeness","fields":{"headline":"Dungeness's strange beauty under threat from shingle plan","bodyText":"The view from the windows of Ken and June Thomas's black-tarred cottage is extraordinary. The largest expanse of shingle beach in Europe is dotted with rare plants and desert flowers. Birds screech as they flock beneath the vast sky. Ken Thomas's fishing boats are pulled high above the tide mark as giant tankers pass by in deep channels scored close to the shore and anglers huddle along the water's edge, their tents hidden in the ridges of shingle. Strain to the right and you can see a lighthouse, built with a unique pigmented, spiralled concrete. Beyond is the weathered shack where Marconi sent the first radio messages across the Channel, and along to the left is Derek Jarman's celebrated Prospect Cottage, with its driftwood garden and John Donne's poetry carved in wood on its wall. At the tip of the promontory is the Dungeness nuclear power station. It is no ordinary backyard. This week residents of the 99 Dungeness houses – many of them built on top of Victorian railway carriages dragged on to the shingle a century ago – will attend a public meeting with Kent county council and EDF, the company operating the Dungeness B plant, to discuss a controversial planning application that would see this landscape change dramatically. The proposal, from EDF and the Environment Agency, is to have between 50 and 100 quarry lorries a day, each weighing 30 tonnes and three metres wide, coming along the 3.1-metre wide unmade road for five days a week, trundling right past their front doors. Diggers will be out too, along a 300-metre stretch of seafront, pulling out up to 30,000 tonnes of shingle a year to dump it back into the sea a few miles away down the coast. The idea is to \"recycle\" the shingle by piling it on to the eroding coastline on the Kent-East Sussex border and prop up the beach in front of the power station. Anglers who come to Dungeness from miles around for its cod and bass fishing have already been getting up petitions over the quarry works fencing, which would cut off access to some of the best fishing spots. Now residents have started a campaign against the plans. They say it is a waste of time and money, because not all the shingle is washed back to its original location. Residents also fear that the huge dumper trucks will destroy the fragile ecosystem and turn away the growing numbers of tourists who have been starting to visit their stretch of the Romney marshes. Dungeness is also of international importance, designated as a national nature reserve, a special protection area, a special area of conservation and a site of special scientific interest. A similar scheme of quarrying the eastern side ended in 2007 over concerns for the environment, and since then the Environment Agency, responsible for England's coastline defences, had been buying in shingle from inland quarries. But that costs three times as much as digging out the beach – or \"borrow pit\", as the area to be excavated is known. In a statement, the Environment Agency said: \"Recycling shingle has an effect on the Dungeness special area of conservation, and in 2007 we stopped using the borrow pit and started to explore how we might minimise this effect while still maintaining the defences. Recycling shingle from the borrow pit provides the best value for money for the taxpayer and means that we can stretch public funds further to reduce the risk of flooding to more homes and businesses.\" It would seem to go against the Department for Energy and Climate Change which, in a recent report on sites for a new nuclear facility, rejected Dungeness, stating: \"If shingle had to be sourced from Dungeness for sea defence purposes, then this could impact this nationally and internationally important conservation site\". For local people it could also radically set back the area's growing popularity as a tourist destination. \"Since they stopped quarrying here in 2007 the tourists have been coming. We get coachloads of schoolchildren, students on photography courses, bird watchers, photographers, the anglers of course. With the power station going out of commission we need the tourism for the local economy,\" said June Thomas. \"You can't expect anyone to come here when there are giant lorries constantly going up and down. It's not safe.\" She can see the \"borrow pit\" from her windows. \"I dread it. As they load the lorries the sound will be awful, a mass of shingle being dropped from a height into a metal container, all day, every day, awful.\" Her husband Ken, 60, is from a family who have fished here for generations. For him the plan itself doesn't make sense. \"They will just change the profile of the beach and the channels, but do nothing to stop coastal erosion. None of them has any idea of how shingle moves. They had no idea how the shingle would shift when they built the power station and they wouldn't listen to the fishermen who told them this would happen, that they were building it in the wrong place. 'Now they're not listening again. They haven't done basic research to see what works and what doesn't by way of coastal defences. They stopped it once, when the conservationists stepped in and said that method can't be done. Now they want to save money and they've come back to it. They think Dungeness is a dump, a wasteland. Well, they're out of date, it's recognised now for what it is, somewhere special.\" Paul Schwartfeger's house is built around a Victorian railway carriage, complete with parquet floor. He has been busy making up \"No to Quarrying\" posters that almost all the homes have in their windows. He says the EDF and Environment Agency proposals are short-sighted and won't provide any long-term defence against the longshore drift that affects the stretch of coast from Kent into East Sussex. \"The quarrying at Dungeness is a cheap way of trying to tackle a major problem but all the expertise points to it not working. The Environment Agency says itself that flood defence strategies we need to be working with are those which manage risk – protecting and restoring and copying the natural regulating function of rivers, floodplains and coasts.\" Mudflats and salt marshes provide a natural \"sponge\" for rising sea levels rather than hard barriers like shingle, while lifting the shingle also allows more water into the land – raising the water table and, in effect, raising the flood risk. \"What makes me feel really angry is the hoops we have to jump through, and rightly so, about planning and the environment. We can't touch the land in our garden or put up a fence. It's a privilege to live here, but then the council can come along and decide quite arbitrarily to dig it all up. It's extraordinary,\" says Schwartfeger. The protesters also make the point that EDF and the Environment Agency could dredge shingle offshore for a similar cost but without the noise and disruption. That's not something the owner of the fishing tackle shop in the nearby village of Greatstone is keen on. Tony Hills is chairman of Dungeness Angling Association and a Shepway district councillor. He believes the government's rejection of Dungeness as a nuclear site could still be overturned and is in favour of a quarry to provide the necessary shingle. \"We need jobs desperately. Economic advantage shouldn't be put off by environmental needs. If we don't get sea defences, we don't get a power station, and vice versa.\" He adds: \"What's going to happen if we don't do this? For starters, you're leaving the 30,000 people living in the marsh area to drown.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/may/20/honda-swindon-factory-two-day-week","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-20T08:13:02Z","webTitle":"Honda's Swindon factory on two-day week until August","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/20/honda-swindon-factory-two-day-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/may/20/honda-swindon-factory-two-day-week","fields":{"headline":"Honda's Swindon factory on two-day week until August","bodyText":"The restricted supply of car parts caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami is continuing to hit car production at Honda's Swindon plant.

Readings from reactor two at the site have been made public by the Japanese authorities and Tepco, the utility that operates it. Richard Lahey, who was head of safety research for boiling-water reactors at General Electric when the company installed the units at Fukushima, told the Guardian workers at the site appeared to have \"lost the race\" to save the reactor, but said there was no danger of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe.

At least part of the molten core, which includes melted fuel rods and zirconium alloy cladding, seemed to have sunk through the steel \"lower head\" of the pressure vessel around reactor two, Lahey said. \"The indications we have, from the reactor to radiation readings and the materials they are seeing, suggest that the core has melted through the bottom of the pressure vessel in unit two, and at least some of it is down on the floor of the drywell,\" Lahey said. \"I hope I am wrong, but that is certainly what the evidence is pointing towards.\" The major concern when molten fuel breaches a containment vessel is that it reacts with the concrete floor of the drywell underneath, releasing radioactive gases into the surrounding area. At Fukushima, the drywell has been flooded with seawater, which will cool any molten fuel that escapes from the reactor and reduce the amount of radioactive gas released. Lahey said: \"It won't come out as one big glob; it'll come out like lava, and that is good because it's easier to cool.\" The drywell is surrounded by a secondary steel-and-concrete structure designed to keep radioactive material from escaping into the environment. But an earlier hydrogen explosion at the reactor may have damaged this. \"The reason we are concerned is that they are detecting water outside the containment area that is highly radioactive and it can only have come from the reactor core,\" Lahey added. \"It's not going to be anything like Chernobyl, where it went up with a big fire and steam explosion, but it's not going to be good news for the environment.\" The radiation level at a pool of water in the turbine room of reactor two was measured recently at 1,000 millisieverts per hour. At that level, workers could remain in the area for just 15 minutes, under current exposure guidelines. A less serious core meltdown happened at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in 1979. During that incident, engineers managed to cool the molten fuel before it penetrated the steel pressure vessel. The task is a race against time, because as the fuel melts it forms a blob that becomes increasingly difficult to cool. In the light of the Fukushima crisis, Lahey said all countries with nuclear power stations should have \"Swat teams\" of nuclear reactor safety experts on standby to give swift advice to the authorities in times of emergency, with international groups co-ordinated by the International Atomic Energy Authority. The warning came as the Japanese authorities were being urged to give clearer advice to the public about the safety of food and drinking water contaminated with radioactive substances from Fukushima. Robert Peter Gale, a US medical researcher who was brought in by Soviet authorities after the Chernobyl disaster, in 1986, has met Japanese cabinet ministers to discuss establishing an independent committee charged with taking radiation data from the site and translating it into clear public health advice. \"What is fundamentally disturbing the public is reports of drinking water one day being above some limit, and then a day or two later it's suddenly safe to drink. People don't know if the first instance was alarmist or whether the second one was untrue,\" said Gale. \"My recommendation is they should consider establishing a small commission to independently convert the data into comprehensible units of risk for the public so people know what they are dealing with and can take sensible decisions,\" he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2011/jun/23/countdown-to-zero-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-23T21:20:01Z","webTitle":"Countdown to Zero – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/23/countdown-to-zero-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2011/jun/23/countdown-to-zero-review","fields":{"headline":"Countdown to Zero – review","bodyText":"When Lucy Walker's throat-grabbingly brilliant documentary about nuclear weapons first surfaced last year at the Cannes film festival, it seemed like the best horror film of all time. I spent most of it softly bleating with fear. Walker wakes us up to our willed, consensual torpor about nuclear weapons, and the unexamined post-cold war fiction that they somehow don't matter, that the threat doesn't exist and that worrying about it is passe. On the contrary, Walker makes a stomach-churningly plausible case that a nuclear explosion could still be caused by terrorists or rogue states with stolen material, or by an old-fashioned Strangelove cock-up. These two ideological halves of the Armageddon-argument mean that she has secured interviews with heavyweight commentators from both left and right; including Mikhail Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter and Tony Blair, who, remarkably, appears finally to rediscover some of his progressive roots with a guarded call for \"zero\" nuclear weapons. There is chilling footage of J Robert Oppenheimer – the father of the A-bomb – gazing into the camera with his Mona Lisa smile, as if amused by man's imminent annihilation. But those hoping for nostalgic black-and-white footage of Michael Foot in his duffel coat at Aldermaston will be disappointed. Walker does not interview anyone from CND or even mention CND, perhaps afraid that her film will be written off as old-style Spartist agitprop. A good deal has happened since Walker's film was made. Osama bin Laden has been killed by US forces inside Pakistan's borders without, so far, any retaliation – which colours some of the film's probing of Pakistan as a querulous, hair-trigger nuclear power. The Arab Spring is ongoing, which arguably makes Iran's pro-nuke theocracy more isolated than Walker implies, and her film was made before the inconclusive military adventure to unseat Libya's Colonel Gaddafi by a new Coalition of the Semi-Willing, exposing us to jibes that the Allies are in effect assisting al-Qaida in north Africa – the same al-Qaida who are reportedly keen to purchase lumps of enriched uranium from former Soviet states. But her film is basically not out of date. In fact, it is still screamingly urgent and contemporary. The vast panoply of annihilation-technology is incredible. The secret history of preparation for the apocalypse induces a kind of spiritual vertigo. Perhaps the most gobsmacking anecdote is that concerning a Strangelove near-miss in the 1990s. The Russians mistook some innocuous American aircraft for a nuclear attack. The Kremlin's generals marched into Boris Yeltsin's office and demanded a response. Yeltsin simply refused to believe the Americans would do such a thing, and the world was saved. One commentator says it was because he was sober. It may have been because he was drunk. Very few films can be classified as unmissable, but this is one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/30/editorial-climate-change-iea-birol","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-29T23:05:53Z","webTitle":"Global warming: Bleaker and bleaker | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/30/editorial-climate-change-iea-birol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/30/editorial-climate-change-iea-birol","fields":{"headline":"Global warming: Bleaker and bleaker","bodyText":"Sometimes a quotation really does say it all. As chief economist of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol is not given to overstatement – so his comment in our paper today that the latest figures on greenhouse gas emissions are \"the worst news\" should be taken seriously. It is not just that the statistics showing another record leap in carbon output – 30.6 gigatonnes of CO2 over 2010 – to make the highest annual total in history are grim. They also come at a point when the old centrist certainties about how to tackle climate change are palpably out of date, and yet no new ideas have come along as replacement. Over the past half-decade, three global-warming orthodoxies have pertained: the first diplomatic, the second economic, and the third industrial. The diplomatic orthodoxy was this: the best way to negotiate reductions in carbon emissions was the UN. That was the fairest forum, which allowed poorer, smaller countries a platform alongside the old economic behemoths. It could be effective, too: the 1989 Montreal protocol to phase out the use of CFCs and other ozone-harming substances had been described by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan as \"perhaps the single most successful international agreement\". Even the Kyoto treaty could be seen as a success, if you squinted hard enough. But then came Copenhagen in 2009, which was a flop. More negotiations take place at Durban this December, and already the British and the Americans are warning observers not to get their hopes up. Economically, the optimists argued that the great recession of 2008-09 would give governments and industrialists a vital breathing space. A contracting world economy would naturally reduce carbon emissions, meantime, public and private sectors could strike a green new deal that would begin a shift towards low-carbon growth. Today's figures give the lie to all that: the link between GDP growth and greenhouse gases remains overwhelming. True, the distribution may have shifted eastwards since the Kyoto protocol – but that is partly because the west increasingly imports its manufactured goods. Finally, industrially, the great bet was that rich countries would wean themselves off fossil fuels and on to a mix of nuclear and renewables. Yet Fukushima has prompted Germany, Italy and Switzerland to mothball their nuclear power projects. Today's figures, then, show a world still hurtling towards dangerous climate change – at a time when policymakers are out of solutions for slowing this process. \"A nice utopia\" is how Mr Birol describes the hope of keeping a rise in global temperatures below 2C. And if he thinks that, we should all be alarmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/2009/apr/15/nuclear-sites-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-15T08:12:26Z","webTitle":"Potential sites for UK nuclear power stations revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/15/nuclear-sites-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2009/apr/15/nuclear-sites-revealed","fields":{"headline":"Potential sites for UK nuclear power stations revealed","bodyText":"A list of potential sites for new nuclear power stations was unveiled by the government today. Nine of the locations have previously been home to nuclear reactors – including Dungeness in Kent and Sizewell in Suffolk – while two others are close to the former Sellafield reactor site in Cumbria. The sites have been nominated by companies interested in building the stations and have been initially approved by the government. The list of potential locations is: Dungeness in Kent; Sizewell in Suffolk; Hartlepool in Cleveland; Heysham in Lancashire; Sellafield in Cumbria; Braystones in Cumbria; Kirksanton in Cumbria; Wylfa Peninsula in Anglesey; Oldbury in Gloucestershire; Hinkley Point in Somerset and Bradwell in Essex. The proposals form part of the government's plan to build a new generation of nuclear power stations to help close what has been described as a \"generation gap\", which is expected as existing nuclear and coal-fired stations shut down. Members of the public are now being asked for their views during a month-long consultation period. The energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"This is another important step towards a new generation of nuclear power stations. \"I want to listen to what people have to say about these nominations and I encourage people to log on to our website, read the information and let us have their comments. Nuclear power is part of the low-carbon future for Britain. \"It also has the potential to offer thousands of jobs to the UK and multi-million pound opportunities to British businesses.\" The sites have been nominated by the energy giants EDF, E.ON and RWE, and by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which owns some nuclear sites. None are in Scotland or Northern Ireland, where planning is a devolved issue. Matthew Riddle, South Gloucestershire councillor for the Severn area, said plans to bring the Oldbury site, near Thornbury, back into use would bring jobs and a boost to the local economy. \"The general reaction from people here is that they are fairly happy about a power station at Oldbury, there is no great groundswell of opposition to it,\" he said. \"Nationally we need more power generation in this country. \"My concern is what will happen during the construction in terms of extra traffic and the increase in people coming to live in the area to work. \"E.ON have bought more land around the site than they need and I would like to ensure that land is managed as farm land and not just left to become wasteland.\" Charles Barnett, chairman of the Shutdown Sizewell Campaign, in Suffolk, said: \"The government is going down the wrong path in proposing that we should have more nuclear power stations. They are not safe. With the heightened risk of terrorism, it's fool-hardy to build more. \"They are very expensive and they leave a legacy of dangerous waste. We shall be resisting the plans. The way forward is benign energy forms – wind, waves, solar and biomass.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-stock-markets","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T20:03:03Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake rocks London stock market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-stock-markets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-stock-markets","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake rocks London stock market","bodyText":"The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan led to a flurry of activity on the London stock market and further afield , as investors digested the impact of the disaster on British and global companies. The explosion at the Fukushima nuclear plant caused particular financial upheaval, as investors moved money from companies exposed to the nuclear sector and into other forms of power generation. The biggest riser among the top 100 stocks was Aggreko, the fast-growing temporary power supplier. A company spokesperson said the business was \"ready to help Japan and its people in any way it can by supplying temporary power if asked\". Its shares rose more than 8%, finishing 116p up at £15.23. The FTSE index of 100 leading shares fell 53 points, or nearly 1%, to 5775 – its lowest point since the beginning of December last year. Shares in companies linked to nuclear power fell around the world, particularly after the Swiss government took the decision to suspend approvals for new nuclear projects. American group General Electric was down in early US trading, while French company EDF, which is among those looking to build 12 proposed new nuclear power stations in the UK over the next few years, saw its shares fall 5%. London-listed Amec, which also has a big nuclear business from new build to decommissioning, was also hit, falling 3.2%, or 37p, to reach £11.15. A number of uranium explorers listed on the London markets were also suffering. Kalahari Minerals, an AIM-listed miner that specialises in uranium, gold, copper and other base metals in Namibia, saw its shares fall 7.7%, wiping £60m from its market value. Spanish uranium explorer Berkeley Resources was also down, by 15%. Solar energy companies, by contrast, were up. First Solar, a US solar specialist, saw its shares rise almost 7%. As well as weighing up the impact on energy generation, investors were moving their money out of the luxury goods sector. Japan is the third largest market for luxury goods, with the consultancy Bain suggesting the market there was worth €18bn (£15.6bn) in 2009. An expectation that the Japanese economy, if not just consumer spending, would be hit, pushed Burberry's shares down. The market generates 7% of Burberry's sales, and as a result it was the largest faller among FTSE 100 stocks , losing 4.3%, or 51p, to finish at £11.23. That trend was replicated worldwide too, with the top European luxury goods companies all reeling from the impact. In Paris, shares in LVMH were down more than 3% while Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner PPR was off 2.5%. Analysts at MF Global suggested demand for luxury goods could be \"badly impacted\" in the short term. The effect on insurers was also worrying investors. Though few UK insurers have bills to pick up from the Japanese disaster, the effect on reinsurers and a potential hardening of the insurance market were of concern. Shares in Aviva fell in particular, with the UK's largest insurer down 3%, or by 14p, to 440p. One Lloyds insurer that did insure Japanese assets, Chaucer Holdings, was at pains to point out the limits of its involvement. Its specialist nuclear syndicate provides cover to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the Fukushima nuclear plants. Chaucer said its policy specifically excludes earthquakes and tsunamis. Insurers will only be called on to cover commercial losses, since the Japanese government covers residential losses from earthquakes. Kathy Fear, an insurance analyst at UBS, said in a note that some of the share price drops for the insurers were probably overdone: \"Given the scale of the earthquake and the global spread of insurers and reinsurers in the region, it is too early to estimate either the total industry loss or the individual company losses.\" Coming on the back of the New Zealand earthquake and the Australian floods, global reinsurers are expected to be under pressure to meet their profits figures as a result of the unprecedented sequence of natural disasters. Reinsurers Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re have collectively lost €3.1bn (£2.6bn) in market valuations since the disaster on Friday. All three were falling further, with declines of about 3-4%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/07/japan-earthquake-tsunami-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-07T17:41:00Z","webTitle":"New earthquake shakes Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/japan-earthquake-tsunami-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/07/japan-earthquake-tsunami-warning","fields":{"headline":"New earthquake shakes Japan","bodyText":"North-eastern Japan has been shaken by its biggest aftershock since the 11 March earthquake and its immediate aftermath. Authorities warned people to flee some coastal areas as a result of the offshore quake, which was centred in the same area as the original. Nearly 12,700 people died and another 14,700 are missing as a result of the 11 March disaster. The latest quake shook buildings hundreds of miles away and authorities issued a warning that waves of up to two metres might hit the coast of Miyagi prefecture. People were told to \"evacuate immediately\" to a safe place away from the shore. Neighbouring provinces were advised coastal areas might experience half-metre waves. The quake was measured at magnitude 7.1 with an epicentre 40 miles off the coast of Sendai and 30 miles under the sea. Announcers on Japan's public broadcaster NHK told coastal residents to run to higher ground and away from the shore. But the Japan Meteorological Agency cancelled its tsunami warnings and advisories within 90 minutes. Officials at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant said there was no immediate sign of new problems. Japan's nuclear safety agency said workers there retreated to a quake-resistant shelter in the complex and no one was injured. The plant has been in crisis mode trying to stop reactors melting down after the original quake and tsunami knocked out its cooling systems. The latest quake knocked out several power lines at the Onagawa nuclear power plant north of Sendai, which has been shut down since the tsunami. One remaining line was supplying power to the plant and radiation monitoring devices detected no abnormalities. The plant's spent fuel pools briefly lost cooling but an emergency diesel generator kicked in.

As well as poring over the parties' manifestos, we have compiled a series of questions with the help of Brian Cox, Simon Singh, Ben Goldacre, Petra Boynton and David Nutt to explore the politicians' attitudes to science. We start with the Liberal Democrats (because they were first off the starting blocks with their answers). You can find the party's complete, unedited responses here. Even before the Liberal Democrats burst onto the election scene with the first televised leaders' debate, the party had gained a lot of credibility within the scientific community thanks to the efforts of Evan Harris, an MP who has made it his mission in recent years to campaign alongside scientists on a range of issues from libel reform to quack medicine. Harris answered our questions in person. The party came out well in our European Elections feature last year. How do they measure up in the run-up to the general election? Three policies in the Liberal Democrats' manifesto are particularly welcome: a commitment to closing the gender gap in science; a pledge to open up public access to research results; and a promise to ensure the independence of science advisers in the wake of the David Nutt affair, a debacle that has turned many in the scientific community away from Labour. However, their policies on energy and climate change are unconvincing. Professor Brian Cox: Science funding Do you plan to maintain Britain's science budget below the European average? \"Britain's future depends on a vibrant research base and the ability of innovators to exploit the country's intellectual capital to generate new home-grown, high-tech industries.\" From a reading of their answers here and their manifesto commitments, the Liberal Democrats seem genuinely keen to ensure that the research budget is preserved and independent, aiming to reduce Whitehall interference and moving sharply away from the business-oriented approach that has prevailed in the Labour years, with its emphasis on commercial benefits. They won't commit to anything beyond preserving the budget for the next year, however, preferring to see how the economy performs in that time. This is frustrating but fair enough. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? Evan Harris achieved heroic status among sceptics for his performance during the Science and Technology Select Committee's homeopathy evidence check last year, and the Lib Dems take a suitably scientific and rational line on alternative medicine. They would actively seek a full review of complementary and alternative therapies and, \"[if] NICE's advice was that the treatment did not perform better than placebo, then of course it should not be supported by the NHS.\" That's the quack vote lost, then. Dr Simon Singh: Libel reform What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Currently there is no statutory public interest defence, so scientists risk running the gauntlet of London's High Court if they publish material they believe to be in the public interest, but that a major corporation or litigious charlatan believes to be libellous. Simon Singh's epic court battle with the British Chiropractic Association highlighted serious flaws in the British legal system: flaws that saw an organisation promoting bogus treatments engage a scientist in a battle over the meaning of a word (\"bogus\") and costing the best part of half a million pounds to resolve before even reaching trial. The BCA decided to cut its losses. The Lib Dems make a commitment to libel reform in their manifesto, with pledges to protect statements made in the public interest or in peer-reviewed work, end libel tourism, and reduce costs. They say they would also ban large corporations from suing individuals, in order to prevent \"imbalance\" in the system. Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? \"We would prefer to use the enormous subsidies that would be needed for nuclear to invest in renewable energy and insulation, which would be a cheaper and quicker way of reducing emissions.\" With all three of the main parties firmly committed to large CO2 reductions, the political debate over the need to act on climate change has long since passed, and the question for the next parliament is how we achieve those targets. Key to this is energy, and the Liberal Democrats are notable among the main three parties for their opposition to nuclear power, which they regard as too expensive, and too slow to bring online. Instead, they want to invest in renewables and in reducing energy consumption through efficiency measures, for example programmes to improve home insulation. While this is all very good in theory, I'm sceptical about their ability to achieve this in practice, especially given that their \"fully-costed manifesto\" sets aside just a little over a billion for this in 2010-11, with more than half of that to be spent on replacing buses and insulating public buildings, and only around £400m invested in upscaling renewable energy supplies. Is this a realistic plan? Professor David Nutt: Drugs policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? The Lib Dems have been praised for their progressive attitude to drug policy, and what's remarkable – but shouldn't be – is that they are committed to putting evidence first, rather than basing regulation on the views of Daily Mail columnists. Under the Liberal Democrats, drug classification would be based on independent scientific advice for the first time, with a focus on implementing policies that can be demonstrated to reduce harm. Dr Petra Boynton: Public health campaigns How will your party ensure public health/education campaigns are underpinned by evidence, and how will you evaluate their success? \"We would ... use polling data collected before and after campaigns to evaluate their success in order to inform future campaigns, as well as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or other rigorous ways of evaluating the success of interventions.\" The idea of using properly controlled trials to test government policy is an excellent one, and shows a real commitment to basing policy on evidence over ideology. Ben Goldacre: Pharmaceutical regulation Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture? \"Yes, they should. Studies have shown a publication bias whereby positive results of drugs trials are disproportionately represented. Public health depends on a good evidence base, and a publication bias clearly skews that evidence base.\" In their manifesto, however, the Lib Dems fall a little short of a commitment to making this happen, which is a shame as it would have complemented their pledges on open research. Pandemic readiness Do you believe the swine flu pandemic posed a significant risk to Britain? What action would your government take if a similar situation emerged in the future? The Lib Dems say they will draw on the best available advice from independent scientists and international bodies. Refreshingly, they say that \"we reject the idea that if a worst case scenario does not come to pass then the advice or policy was wrong,\" which will probably cost them Simon Jenkins' vote. Best parliamentary candidate Evan Harris, Oxford West and Abingdon, a strong campaigner on scientific issues. Worst parliamentary candidate David Ord, North Tyneside, who in a response to the website Skeptical Voter suggested that Darwinian evolution wasn't supported by evidence, and compared homeopathy to diluted aspirin. Conclusion While I'm not convinced by their policies on energy, the Liberal Democrats have set a very high standard, with their engagement with the scientific community, and their commitment to evidence-based policy informed by advice from independent experts. Science funding would be reasonably safe, and public health policy would be firmly based on evidence, both of which would make a refreshing change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/dec/06/sir-jeremy-heywood-civil-servant-profile","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-06T20:00:01Z","webTitle":"Sir Jeremy Heywood: the civil servant propping up the government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/06/sir-jeremy-heywood-civil-servant-profile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/dec/06/sir-jeremy-heywood-civil-servant-profile","fields":{"headline":"Sir Jeremy Heywood: the civil servant propping up the government","bodyText":"Minutes after planes hit the twin towers in New York an anxious Tony Blair telephoned the one person he felt could reassure him that London wouldn't come under similar attack, and asked him: \"Are you sure there aren't any aeroplanes flying towards us?\" Seven years later Gordon Brown sat with the same man as the global banking system came close to collapse, and consulted him on how to avert disaster. More recently, David Cameron has grown to depend on him as he grapples with the crises facing the government. Until the last few weeks, if he were mentioned at all, Sir Jeremy Heywood was billed as the country's most powerful man you've never heard of. Lately it's possible that people may have become dimly aware of him, as he has been pushed, unwillingly, into the limelight. The cabinet secretary has been described variously as a Machiavellian figure who wields unconstitutional power, as \"Wormtongue\" (the Tolkien villain) and Rasputin-like, thriving in the \"chaos\" at Downing Street, feeding off an apparent power vacuum in No 10 to accumulate his own power, cheerfully killing off policies for which he has no affection, \"seeing off\" political aides he sees as unhelpful. Friends of Heywood, who is on a £190,000 salary, say he is bemused and embarrassed by the barrage of pieces that, among other things, have questioned the propriety of his role in failed merger negotiations between the British defence company BAE Systems and the European aviation firm EADS, accused him of meddling on European policy, and claimed he has been voicing scepticism behind the scenes about key government programmes, from universal credit to NHS reform – all of which he rejects as untrue. He believes, they say, that reports of his power are overstated and the very suggestion that he might be making decisions on behalf of politicians makes him \"cringe\". He prefers to describe himself, they say, as simply very influential. But this week he has once again played a critical role, attending key meetings ahead of the autumn statement, and taking a leading role in Cameron's so-called L-team – the group of senior advisers helping the prime minister respond to the Leveson inquiry. Heywood is a workaholic who keeps two BlackBerrys in his pocket in case one breaks, and friends describe him as an \"adrenaline junkie\". But he also has a bust of Gandhi on his desk, a reminder of the Indian leader's calm effectiveness and his moral authority. \"He is by some margin the most talented and effective civil servant I have worked with,\" says Lord (Andrew) Adonis, the former head of the Downing Street policy unit under Blair and later Brown's transport secretary. Adonis is not alone in this view. \"In my experience, most top civil servants are in the Sir Humphrey mould and regard it as their job to water and slow down a government's reform programme, as if that were their constitutional duty. They also give advice which is poorly informed and thought through,\" Adonis says. \"Jeremy is in a different league. He makes change happen, while giving good and frank advice on how best to do it and indeed whether to do it all.\" Heywood's predecessor, Lord (Gus) O'Donnell, believes the sudden focus on Heywood is inevitable when things aren't running smoothly. \"When the government is going through tough times, people will look around and think, who can we blame? It's one of the reasons why you need a skin like a rhinoceros to do these jobs.\" His analysis is echoed by Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell: \"If you can't attack the king, you attack the courtiers – that's the whole point of courtiers.\" Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP and the chairman of the public administration select committee, which has been scrutinising civil service reform, also wonders if the criticisms are more to do with the government's weaknesses than with Heywood. \"It is a problem of coalition: all the evidence we have received is that there is no national strategy, there is a lack of coherence at the centre. He has no agenda, but in the absence of clear policy and direction, like the best civil servant, he will fill it in. … He will see it as his job to provide that coherence and strategic direction. Some people will regard that as sinister and some people will see it as a good thing.\" A hint of Heywood's power comes in the nervousness with which most people approach a conversation about him. Most of the two dozen people interviewed for this piece were anxious not to be named, even if they had only overwhelmingly positive things to say about him. Conversations trailed off, with a sudden regretful afterthought: \"Oh dear, I do hope I won't get myself into trouble by talking to you.\" Most intriguing, to anyone outside the civil service machine, is Heywood's extraordinary staying power. His ability to work very closely with successive prime ministers – with Brown as principal private secretary to the chancellor, then to move to the role for Blair while prime minister, then to chief of staff to Brown as prime minister, and then the first Downing Street permanent secretary and then cabinet secretary under Cameron – seems an incredible feat. He has stood by the side of the prime minister who raised taxes for the richest in society, and now assists the prime minister who is cutting them back. He co-operated with Labour's public spending programme, and now stands listening as Tory MPs berate their predecessors for allowing the deficit to spiral. He had a close, affectionate relationship with Blair, later was a calm presence alongside Brown, and within half an hour of waving him out of the building he was clapping in Cameron, forcing himself into a completely different political mindset, a shift he acknowledges required mental agility. Many say making the leap between the Blair and the Brown administrations was the more taxing move. Insiders see nothing unusual in a senior official moving seamlessly from one administration to another – that is the whole point of the civil service. Former colleagues say it's not surprising that successive prime ministers want him there, because over the years he has made himself indispensable. Far from being seen as an unpleasant hangover from the old era, Heywood was welcomed with delight by Cameron's team when they arrived in Downing Street. \"We thought, here's this great, useful, brilliant person who can help us to do what we want,\" a Tory aide says. And when O'Donnell was preparing to leave his job as cabinet secretary late last year, Cameron was certain he wanted Heywood to replace him. \"He completely had faith in him,\" O'Donnell says. The two have known each other since the start of their careers, when Cameron was a special adviser to Norman Lamont as chancellor and Heywood was his private secretary. Cameron has enormous respect for Heywood's economic expertise and Whitehall experience. One observer wonders if there is a danger that Cameron wants to impress Heywood, has a desire to look good in his eyes and secure his approval that he has done the sensible thing – and that he may, as a consequence, be a little too deferential. This can lead to sensible but indecisive behaviour, the observer says. Adonis says: \"He defines the concept of the professional civil servant – free of political bias yet utterly dedicated to helping the elected government implement its programme. Without Jeremy Heywood, Tony Blair's No 10 operation would have been severely weakened and Gordon Brown's would have been highly precarious. He appears to be equally vital to Cameron's No 10. A future Labour government will badly need his talents and the public service is lucky to have him.\" Another Labour-era aide says: \"I've never seen anyone else in his league for getting things done. He can broker things through short emails and phonecalls forcing decisions. He's amazing at deal-making.\" Born in Yorkshire in 1961, Heywood went to a private Quaker school in York, Bootham, before studying history and economics at Oxford. He also studied at the LSE and Harvard, and spent time with the International Monetary Fund. His long service in Whitehall means he is extremely knowledgeable on a range of themes, from the economy to defence procurements, nuclear power, the welfare system, and public services. \"He knows about institutional resistance and understands the art of the possible. He has a very strong sense of what is likely to succeed and not to succeed in the politics of Whitehall,\" says Matthew Taylor, who succeeded Adonis as head of Blair's policy unit. Taylor adds that Heywood's extraordinary competence can make everyone around him relax a little too much. \"There's always a danger, when you've got someone as powerful as him, that other people can end up abdicating responsibility. In the end, you're not submitting ideas which may or may not be approved by the prime minister, you're submitting ideas which Jeremy will judge first. He exudes natural authority. He is just someone you don't want to look stupid or lazy in front of. He's someone whose authority comes from his brain – there's no throwing mobile phones around.\" His work ethic is a key part of what makes him so dependable. \"Jeremy is a Stakhanovite to put Stakhanov to shame; a remarkably swift worker. If Gordon Brown wanted six policies drafted by tomorrow, the one person who could do that is Jeremy,\" Powell says. His day begins around 7.30am, when he and Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service – who took much of the cabinet secretary's management duties when the job was carved up in January – share a car from Clapham in south London. They usually get through three or four important agenda matters en route. Heywood lives in the road parallel to O'Donnell in Balham, and also used to share a car with him into work. Occasionally he comes in with the prime minister's chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, who lives close by. Heywood's wife, Suzanne, is a senior figure at the management consultants McKinsey. The couple have spent some effort and money on upgrading their home, partly so it can accommodate his mother, who is in her 80s, and has moved in. He lists childcare as one of his interests in Who's Who, but finds it hard to see much of his nine-year-old twins and 11-year-old son during the week, unless there's a piano recital or school play, which he tries to slip away to catch. At the weekend, he chauffeurs them around to diving, swimming and fencing classes. He is an obsessive Manchester United fan, likes playing chess and the piano with his children, and is interested in opera. His wife has recently become a member of the Royal Opera House's board of trustees. In January, on becoming cabinet secretary, Heywood moved from a desk outside Cameron's office to a vast, stately room in the Cabinet Office overlooking Horse Guards Parade. Downing Street is still accessible through a back entrance, without the need to step outside the building, and Heywood still attends the prime minister's daily 8.30am and 4pm meetings. He also goes to cabinet meetings, and to the quad, the meeting of the prime minister, his deputy, the chancellor and the chief secretary to the Treasury. Because of the division between the politicians and their advisers, he is not invited to the preparation for prime minister's questions. An onlooker at the 8.30am meetings says that Heywood sits close to Cameron, an informal display of power within the hierarchy. Although schedules vary, his office estimates that he spends between two and three hours in the prime minister's company on an average day. Blair's aide Lady (Sally) Morgan cites Heywood's capacity to work long hours as the key to his success. She wonders if his decision to go into banking, leaving the civil service to work for Morgan Stanley for a few years in 2003, as MD and co-head of the UK investment banking division, was partly motivated by a desire to work shorter hours, because by the standards of Downing Street a banker's hours may seem relaxing. She pays tribute to his decision to return to public service at Brown's invitation in 2007, despite the salary reduction. Other friends suggests he found banking dull, compared with the excitement of government. \"He has a reputation for discretion, which means that people talk to him and don't feel that it's a dangerous thing to do,\" Morgan says. A family friend who has known him for more than a decade reports with amused frustration that it is virtually impossible to get anything interesting out of Heywood about the dynamics of life inside Downing Street. \"I would try to find out if Gordon Brown was a psychotic boss, but he would never go there at all. He barely talks about his job, except once when he was working for Brown and we were there for Sunday lunch, and he said he had had 40 emails from him over the space of three hours; he was laughing.\" Several former colleagues pay tribute to his readiness to have blazing rows over policy, to tell politicians he thinks a policy is \"barmy\" or \"crazy\", but note that if a decision is made to go ahead in spite of his advice, he will be ready to pull the necessary levers to implement it with the same vigour he would have shown if it had been his own idea. \"I used to be amazed listening to flaming rows where he would say all sorts of unsayable things to Ed Balls. Things like 'That's a completely idiotic idea! How can you possibly think that would work?'\" a Labour colleague says. He can provoke fear among colleagues who haven't done their homework and has sharp antennae for bluster. A junior political adviser under Blair remembers being sent back a policy document, with comments from Heywood that in effect stripped out much of the content of the policy. \"I wrote back saying, 'I don't think we'll include those changes.' He wrote back: 'I'm acting on the prime minister's say-so. I could go and pull him out of a European council meeting to make your point, but that would be unfortunate.' He was very understated, but you knew that what he said would go.\" This quiet confidence doesn't project very well, and he is less keen on public appearances than O'Donnell was. The Labour MP Paul Flynn, who sits on the public administration committee, was underwhelmed after his first appearance this year. \"We were so used to GOD [O'Donnell]; he was a bit more leaden-footed. We were expecting to meet pure gold. He turned out to be just another obfuscating civil servant. There was no real thrill.\" Colleagues can't remember him ever cracking a joke. But they note that he's always the first person on the dance floor at the No 10 Christmas party. Heywood has collected a lot of friends, and organises dinner parties where he mixes well-known politicians with old university friends. \"He throws a good party, where you find [Lord] Mandelson dancing like John Travolta in the middle of the floor,\" a neighbour says. On reflection, friends say the guest list tends to be slightly more left-leaning than right, although they wonder if this might simply be out of a reluctance to bring the current inhabitants of Downing Street home at the weekend, rather than hinting at his political inclinations. He does vote in elections, but his friends and colleagues say they would never dream of asking who for, and can detect few clues. His children are educated privately, although this is a decision he has described as a matter of regret. His parents were not involved in politics – his father was a schoolteacher, and his mother is an archaeologist. One former colleague says: \"It's as though the political part of his brain has been cut out of him. It's quite extraordinary.\" In conversation with civil service colleagues, he has a habit of disowning decisions by prefacing instructions with the curiously old-fashioned phrase: \"What our political principals want is this … \" Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, says: \"With some people, their views are reasonably transparent, but Jeremy doesn't reveal his politics even to his closest friends.\" A few weeks ago Portes suggested to his old friend that the government was neither very competent at formulating economic policy, nor at implementing it. \"He spent the evening explaining why the policy was perfect and the implementation wonderful. I wouldn't take that as his belief; he would have said the same three years ago, but he sees it as his job to defend the government even on a social occasion,\" he says. An observer from the current administration says Heywood might agree with him before a meeting, telling him: \"You're totally right; thank God someone is saying that!\" only to change his position during the meeting, as it became clear that the idea did not have the prime minister's support. \"They [prime ministers] like to feel as though you're on their side, in terms of trying to help them achieve what you want them to achieve. You have to show that you've got no particular personal bias yourself,\" a close colleague says. So why all the reports of him snatching power? Some recent No 10 staffers argue that structural changes in the way Downing Street is run, implemented by Cameron – particularly the abandonment and the later reinstatement of the policy unit – have helped create political weakness that has allowed Heywood to strengthen his hold on power. \"In a vacuum he will be an influential person. If there isn't an agenda, he may make an agenda. He's not the kind of person to sit in a room for two hours and say, 'Well, I don't know what to do either.'\" The nature of coalition government has certainly handed him more power, because both sides need help in negotiating their position. One of the things Heywood is most proud of in the current administration was the successful brokering of the coalition agreement. Now he is regarded as the grownup responsible for making sure the structure he built doesn't collapse. Heywood tells colleagues he didn't go into the civil service to exercise power that rightly belongs to democratically elected politicians, and adds that it's not a civil servant's job to ask: \"What do I think about this policy?\" He acknowledges that for much of the time civil servants have to swallow their own views. The suggestion that he's an obstructive figure, willfully slowing down projects to entertain himself, may come from a failure to grasp how difficult it is to implement policy, a current colleague suggests. \"People who see him as the person putting the brakes on things, don't realise that the reason things don't happen quickly is that it is really, really hard to make things happen. You need to be plugging away, grinding away at things, lots of meetings and lots of phone calls. This is all long-term, difficult stuff.\" O'Donnell says: \"If there is a political vacuum, and I'm not saying there is, that's an issue for the prime minister to deal with … I think Jeremy will be very careful not to overstep the mark.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/04/japan-nuclear-plant-release-radioactive-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-04T12:54:47Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear plant releases radioactive water into sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/04/japan-nuclear-plant-release-radioactive-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/04/japan-nuclear-plant-release-radioactive-water","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear plant releases radioactive water into sea","bodyText":"The operator of Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant has started breaking its own regulations by discharging 11,500 tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific to make space for more highly radioactive liquid. The release of water that is 100 times the legal limit is an unprecedented breach of operating standards, but it is considered necessary so workers can concentrate on containing more severe leaks. The government justified the action as the lesser of two evils. Recent samples of contaminated seawater from the leak show radiation levels at 4,000 times the legal standard. \"We didn't have any other alternatives,\" the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, told reporters. \"This is a measure we had to take to secure safety.\" The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric, said it would discharge 10,000 tonnes of water from its waste treatment facility and a further 1,500 tonnes that have collected in pits outside reactors No 5 and No 6. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been notified of the discharge. On a website update, it said the Japanese authorities explained the move was necessary \"to have sufficient capacity to store highly contaminated water found in the basement of the Unit 2 turbine building\". Tokyo Electric estimates the potential additional annual dose to a member of the public would be approximately 0.6 millisieverts if they ate seaweed and seafood caught near the plant every day for a year. The annual permissible level for the general public in Japan is one millisievert. Workers have been battling to control radiation leaks since the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami crippled the plant's cooling system on 11 March, leading to a partial meltdown of the reactor. Earlier attempts to cool the reactor by hosing water from fire engines and helicopters have left pools of contaminated water and flooded basements, hampering the containment operation and efforts to restart the cooling pumps. Highly radioactive water is seeping from at least one point at reactor No 2, where a 20cm crack has been found in a concrete pit. It is thought to be leaking into an inflow conduit for seawater, but there may be other paths of contamination. Plant workers have started to dye the water a milky white colour so they can trace its route. At the weekend workers tried and failed to plug the crack by using 80kg of highly absorbent polymer (more commonly used in nappies) mixed with shredded newspaper and sawdust. A previous attempt to use concrete had a similar outcome. Edano said the situation must be stabilised as soon as possible because a long-term leak \"will have a huge impact on the ocean\".Critics of Japan's nuclear industry said the authorities were confronted with a dilemma that was unique in the history of nuclear power: whether to keep cooling the reactors and spent fuel or reduce the water being pumped into the plant, which is overflowing the capacity of the trenches. \"As a result of Tokyo Electric's desperate but failed efforts to cool the reactors, they are about to release perhaps an unprecedented amount of radioactivity into the environment,\" said Shaun Burnie, a nuclear consultant to Greenpeace Germany. \"If the Japanese government were to take a cupful of this water and take it outside their territorial waters it would be illegal under the law of sea dumping convention.\" As a temporary measure to ease the leak, Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency has recommended the construction of an undersea silt barrier.\"A silt fence ensures that mud down deep doesn't seep through,\" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, Japan's spokesman on nuclear safety. Officials said the situation is unlikely to be under control for several months. Independent analysts warn it might take years. Giant concrete pumps are being sent to the area from overseas. The government has also asked Tokyo Electric to look into the possibility of covering the plant with sheets pinned to a steel frame. But the more radioactivity that enters the air and water, the harder such countermeasures become. Tokyo Electric has said the plant will never recover and some areas are so contaminated that workers cannot get near them. \"I don't know if we can ever enter the No 3 reactor building again,\" Hikaru Kuroda, the company's chief of nuclear facility management, said on Sunday. The situation dominated a meeting in Vienna of signatories to the convention on nuclear safety, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the disasters at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.\"I know you will agree with me that the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi has enormous implications for nuclear power and confronts all of us with a major challenge,\" Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told participants. \"We cannot take a 'business as usual' approach.\" Although the nuclear threat has yet to claim a life, it has overshadowed the severe humanitarian crisis faced by survivors of the tsunami, which killed 12,157 people and has left 15,496 missing. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their homes and millions are still affected by shortages of electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/jan/21/green-challenge-government-nuclear-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-21T18:17:54Z","webTitle":"Green group threatens legal challenge to government's nuclear plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/21/green-challenge-government-nuclear-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jan/21/green-challenge-government-nuclear-plans","fields":{"headline":"Green group threatens legal challenge to government's nuclear plans","bodyText":"Friends of the Earth has threatened to launch a legal challenge against the government over its \"fundamentally flawed\" plans to approve hundreds of new nuclear reactors, power plants, wind farms, electricity pylons and pipelines. The group has written to energy secretary Ed Miliband warning him that government planning statements issued in November breach environmental regulations and had not followed proper consultation. Friends of the Earth said it was also supported by conservation groups, the WWF and RSPB. The energy industry and ministers have been braced for a legal challenge for months, particularly over plans to build as many as 10 new nuclear reactors. Friends of the Earth said it believed the statements, which new planning commission the IPC will use to block or approve applications, would result in Britain \"locking-in\" to a high-carbon energy infrastructure. It said the IPC should have to directly take into account the carbon emissions resulting from individual applications. Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"The government's draft national planning statements on energy are fundamentally flawed.

Tokyo government workers on the earliest shift start at 7:30am and leave at 4:15pm. By better exploiting the early daylight hours this summer, city officials hope to use less air conditioning and office lighting at night. \"It should be a good thing, and it doesn't require any cost,\" Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, said on Friday. \"I think all of Japan should shift to the summer time hours.\" To prevent blackouts in the wake of the 11 March disaster, which knocked out Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima nuclear power plant, Japan's central government has asked companies and government offices to cut electricity usage by 15%. It wants companies to limit air conditioning and set room temperatures at a warm 28C (82F). Officials are also encouraged to follow a new dress code called \"Super Cool Biz\" launched last week that urged employees to wear lighter clothing, such as polo shirts, Aloha shirts and even sneakers instead of the traditional tie and jacket. Households across Tokyo are advised to use electric fans instead of air conditioners, unplug appliances when not in use, and raise temperature settings on refrigerators. Tepco expects to supply 53.8m kilowatts (kW) for Tokyo and its vicinity in July, which is short of an estimated demand of 60mkW. Tokyo uses one-third of Tepco's output. Ishihara has set a more aggressive target of 25% reduction in energy use for Tokyo, and officials are hoping that government workers' new hours will spill over to the private sector. \"To set a good example, we shouldn't keep lights on at our offices until late,\" said city official Hideo Ishii. Some 9,500 employees at the city's headquarters will be fully participating by the end of the week. By July, that number will grow to 25,000. It will exclude teachers, police, firefighters and medical experts. While employees will start work earlier, the clocks inside the city hall won't change. Still, Ishihara would like to take the experiment a step further and establish a yearly daylight saving time, shifting clocks forward during summer as many Western nations do. Changing the clocks in the summer is debated in Japan, with most sentiment opposed. Daylight saving time was imposed in 1948 under the US occupation after Japan's defeat in world war two, but lasted only four years because it was so unpopular and has since been for years remembered negatively. More importantly, corporate culture in Japan is such that many workers feel obligated to work until it is dark outside – no matter what their starting time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/07/japan-doubles-fukushima-radiation-leak-estimate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-07T12:34:49Z","webTitle":"Japan doubles Fukushima radiation leak estimate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/japan-doubles-fukushima-radiation-leak-estimate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/07/japan-doubles-fukushima-radiation-leak-estimate","fields":{"headline":"Japan doubles Fukushima radiation leak estimate","bodyText":"The amount of radiation released by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the days after the 11 March tsunami could have been more than double that originally estimated by its operator, Japan's nuclear safety agency has said. The revelation has raised fears that the situation at the plant, where fuel in three reactors suffered meltdown, was more serious than government officials have acknowledged. In another development that is expected to add to criticism of Japan's handling of the crisis, the agency said molten nuclear fuel dropped to the bottom of the pressure vessel in the No 1 reactor within five hours of the accident, 10 hours earlier than previously thought. By the end of last week, radiation levels inside the reactor had risen to 4,000 millisieverts per hour, the highest atmospheric reading inside the plant since the disaster. The agency also speculated that the meltdown in another reactor had been faster than initially estimated by the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). It is not clear whether the revised account of the accident, the world's worst since Chernobyl in 1986, would have prompted Tepco to respond differently at the time. But it is expected to raise questions about the ability of Japan's nuclear authorities to provide accurate information to the public. According to the latest estimates, 770,000 terabequerels – about 20% as much as the official estimate for Chernobyl – of radiation seeped from the plant in the week after the tsunami, more than double the initial estimate of 370,000. In a possible sign that the contamination is more widespread than previously thought, a university researcher said at the weekend a small amount of plutonium had been identified a mile from the front gate of the Fukushima plant. It is the first time plutonium thought to have originated from the complex has been detected in soil outside its grounds. However, Masayoshi Yamamoto, a professor at Kanazawa University, said the level of plutonium in the sample was lower than average levels observed in Japan after nuclear weapons tests conducted overseas. The release of findings coincided with the start of an investigation on Tuesday into the accident by a 10-member panel. Last week, a fact-finding team from the International Atomic Energy Agency criticised Tepco for failing to acknowledge the risk to the plant from a tsunami, despite warnings from government experts and its own scientists. The panel, led by Yotaro Hatamura, a human error expert from Tokyo University, will issue an interim report by the end of the year. \"I think it is a mistake to consider [the plant] safe,\" he said. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, said he would be willing to undergo questioning in the hope that the report \"stands up to scrutiny from around the world\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/jun/17/bonn-climate-summit-diary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-17T15:17:09Z","webTitle":"Bonn climate summit diary | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jun/17/bonn-climate-summit-diary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/jun/17/bonn-climate-summit-diary","fields":{"headline":"Bonn climate summit diary","bodyText":"Biocarbon Fund figures don't add up The World Bank's flagship Biocarbon Fund project is billed as a triple win for more food production, cash for the poor and climate resilience. Really? The reality is that Africa's first \"soil carbon\" project – which will involve 60,000 Kenyan farmers planting trees, manuring the land, and farming in \"sustainable\" ways to save around 600,000 tonnes of carbon over 20 years – also exhibits the sheer madness of the carbon markets. The excellent US-based Institute for Agriculture Trade Policy (IATP) has now analysed the fine print and found (PDF) that the project expects to earn $2.5m from the carbon markets. But to set it up, to employ advisers and consultants and to monitor it will cost $1.05m. The 60,000 farmers will then share the remaining $1.4m. This sounds good, but works out at a lowly $23.83 each over the 20 years, or just a little more that $1 per year. Moreover, they will only earn this if they change the way they farm and record precisely what they plant, burn and put on the land. Given that the poverty line in Kenya is around $1 a day, the chance for Africans to earn a tiny amount a year – while Swedish and other advisers earn massive amounts – is likely to end in tears. Shefali Sharma, the IATP researcher who uncovered the figures, is succinct: \"Why pay over 40% of the total project cost towards development of carbon offset when it could go directly towards climate adaptation and food security?\" Wooden spoon for the Saudis The country which has done most to delay the talks and prevent a resolution in the last two weeks has been named by the NGOs here as Saudi Arabia. The kingdom frequently earns itself \"fossil of the day\" awards, but this time excelled itself by arguing that countries did not need to agree on activities for another 18 months and then blocking any moves by countries to let the public see what actually goes on in meetings. Tying in second place were Japan and Canada. The latter somehow neglected to include its tar sands in its national inventory emissions report and also refused to accept a legally binding target under a second phase of Kyoto. Japan, to everyone's surprise after the Fukushima accident, argued that nuclear power should be allowed to earn carbon credits. Young at heart Whoops. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said clearly in its daily programme yesterday that youth groups (Youngos) and environment groups (Engos) were not open to the public or the press. But they were wrong, I am assured, and Friends of the Earth International, Via Campesina and many others insist that they welcome participation in their meetings. The youth groups were furious: \"You can come on the condition you feel young at heart,\" said one.

The central charge of the report, from the environmental audit committee, is that \"the UK's finance ministry has undermined public trust in green taxes by appearing to use them as a revenue raising tool rather than a serious attempt to change environmentally damaging behaviour.\" It cites in particular the cutting of a penny from fuel duty in the last budget, which I called \"shaking an impotent fist at rising global prices\", while providing no extra money to support public transport. There are more examples in our news story. The chair of the EAC, Joan Walley, has a solution: \"The Treasury should start to rebuild trust in environmental taxes by ring-fencing some of the revenues raised from fuel duty to cut soaring train and bus fares.\" She is quite right. Consider the contempt in which many motorists hold speed cameras, or \"government cash machines\", as they like to call them. The evidence that speed cameras save lives is incontrovertible, yet the failure to use the revenue to cut the costs of motoring means a righteous fury can take hold and destroy reason. The report could have also mentioned the straight smash-and-grab with which the Treasury converted the revenue-neutral carbon reduction commitment into a tax. But, as important as the tax issue is, the real sting of the report is in the broadside it delivers against a battery of Treasury policies. • Subsidies for new nuclear power: The government denies these exist, but the report states: \"The government's definition of a 'subsidy' in relation to nuclear ... does not hold up to scrutiny. Nuclear will be subsidised in the same way as renewable energy sources, which have no adverse environmental impacts, and nuclear will benefit the most.\" • The bank that can't borrow: The green investment bank \"could be a driver for the green economy but preventing it from borrowing will limit its impact on renewables and the support it can provide for the Green Deal. Fresh consideration should be given to when ... the bar on the Bank's lending powers might be eased.\" • Green growth: The Plan for Growth \"did not provide the much needed step change to aid the transition to a low-carbon economy, and in some areas - e.g. the zero carbon homes standard - the Government has taken a backwards step. The forthcoming Roadmap to a Green Economy must dispel any suggestion that a green economy is an 'add-on' rather than an integral part of the Government's sustainable development plans.\" Ouch. Those I talk to in and around government repeatedly cite the Treasury, and its politically-astute chancellor George Osborne, as the roadblock to a world-leading green economy. The department sits obstinately in the way, brandishing the outdated orthodoxy that \"green\" and \"growth\" cannot be paired. Some of the trolls protest: \"We're pretty radical compared to most finance ministries,\" one told me. But with China, Germany, Korea and others racing ahead towards the low-carbon economy that represents the only sustainable economic future, that's just not good enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/jul/28/centrica-british-gas-profits-refuel-row-over-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-28T13:03:00Z","webTitle":"British Gas owner Centrica attacked over £1.3bn profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/28/centrica-british-gas-profits-refuel-row-over-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/jul/28/centrica-british-gas-profits-refuel-row-over-prices","fields":{"headline":"British Gas owner Centrica attacked over £1.3bn profits","bodyText":"The parent group of British Gas unveiled profits of £1.3bn on Thursday but insisted that its recent 18% increase in some domestic power prices was entirely justified, despite consumer anger. Centrica's \"adjusted\" first-half profits, achieved on revenues of £11.5bn, were 19% lower than 2010 – but they were deemed sufficient to justify a 12% increase in the dividend payment to shareholders. The company said that the residential arm of British Gas had recorded a 54% slump in operating profits to £270m and argued that the business would have been driven into a loss in the second half of the year without the recently announced 18% increase in gas prices and 16% rise in electricity bills for many of the company's nine million UK consumers. Nick Luff, Centrica's finance director, said that domestic energy prices were largely driven up by rising wholesale costs, while the group needed profits to invest in the future. \"We made operating profits of £1.3bn but we also invested £1.3bn, and if we are not going to invest in future oil and gas projects then the country will only see even higher energy prices,\" he added. Luff added that British Gas's net profit margin fell to between 6% and 7% in the first six months of 2011, down from about 8% a year ago. It is expected to remain between 6% and 7% for the next six months, as the higher prices kick in. Responding to Centrica's results, Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said energy companies such as British Gas always seemed to benefit when the UK householder did not. \"Centrica seems to win whether wholesale costs are high or low,\" she said. \"Retail profit margins may have been reduced by recent increases in wholesale prices – but as they are also major gas and electricity wholesalers, they can still make healthy profits at the other end. \"Consumers will be more worried by their increasing bills than [by] which part of an energy company makes the most money. Given that Centrica profits remain strong, consumers are bound to question whether recent large price hikes were necessary.\" The energy regulator, Ofgem, is currently undertaking a review into whether the dominance by the \"big six\" energy providers, including British Gas, EDF and E.ON, distorts the market and allows for profiteering. Luff denied this was the case, adding: \"We have had 15 different reviews in the past 10 years and none has concluded that Britain was anything other than a competitive market.\" He accepted British Gas had been recently rapped over the knuckles over its complaints-handling service but said that it was always looking for ways to improve the way it worked. Stephen Fitzpatrick, founder and managing director of the independent energy company Ovo, argued there was a lack of transparency in energy company accounts which enabled the big six to hide their profits while passing price increases on to consumers. \"Centrica's profits announcement, hot on the heels of its 18% price hike, is another blow to consumers. Until the big six providers fully explain to bill payers where their money is going, consumers will never trust energy companies,\" he argued. Centrica has been under fire from some analysts for its involvement with Electricité de France (EDF) in an expensive plan to build four new nuclear power stations in Britain. On Thursday it said that the timetable had slipped from its original 2018 start date and insisted it would only proceed if it made commercial sense to do so. Luff said that a whole range of issues still needed to be clarified, including the detail and impact of the government's electrical market reform. But EDF said in a separate statement that it had received the go-ahead from West Somerset district council to start preparatory work at Hinkley Point and would formally submit applications for a nuclear site operating licence on Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/sep/09/thorium-weinberg-foundation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-09T11:33:10Z","webTitle":"Thorium advocates launch pressure group | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/09/thorium-weinberg-foundation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/09/thorium-weinberg-foundation","fields":{"headline":"Thorium advocates launch pressure group","bodyText":"Parliamentary events are often dull affairs, but Thursday night's launch of the Weinberg Foundation – a new pressure group advocating thorium nuclear energy – was quite the opposite. I can't remember the last time I stood in a room full of people concerned about climate change that was so full of optimism. Part of the warm glow may have been the result of a small pang of pride at the Guardian's involvement. Two of the key people behind it all – the host, Bryony Worthington, and the keynote speaker, nuclear engineer Kirk Sorensen – met at the Manchester Report, a Guardian event on climate solutions. Worthington was on the judging panel; Sorensen was advocating a little-known nuclear reactor design based on liquid thorium fuel. In the two years since, Worthington has been appointed to the House of Lords and Sorensen quit his day job to set up FLIBE energy, a company dedicated to commercialising liquid-fluoride thorium reactors. Their collective enthusiasm for the technology played a key role in the creation of the Weinberg Foundation, which was set up \"to drive awareness, research and commercialisation of cleaner and safer nuclear technologies, fuelled by thorium.\" The idea is to create a new generation of nuclear reactors based on the element thorium, as opposed to the uranium used to produce nuclear power today. Thorium, its advocates claim, is beneficial not only because it's far more abundant and widely distributed in the Earth's crust than uranium; in addition, liquid-fluoride thorium reactors (LFTRs) could theoretically be much smaller, much cheaper and much safer than conventional nuclear reactors. The waste they produce would remain dangerous for a far shorter period and, crucially, couldn't be used to create nuclear weapons. As a bonus, these fourth-generation nuclear plants could even burn up the dangerous plutonium stored in existing nuclear waste stockpiles, using it as a fuel. The Weinberg team is already talking to Sellafield about this idea. LFTRs aren't the only way to use thorium to create energy. In a solid-oxide form, thorium can be used in existing, conventional light-water reactors. But that has a number of downsides, including the fact that it converts only a tiny proportion of the energy in the fuel into electricity. Particle physicists such as Nobel-prize-winner Carlo Rubbia have also advocated the use of sub-critical accelerator-driven thorium reactors, but this remains in the realm of scientific theory rather than nuclear engineering. By contrast, liquid-fluoride thorium reactors are not just efficient but also proven – albeit some time ago. The US military produced a working prototype more than half a century ago at the Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee. It ran for a number of years before the programme was suddenly shut down and the US government's stocks of thorium buried. The most likely reason for this decision, it seems, is that LFTRs – unlike uranium reactors – didn't go hand-in-hand with nuclear weapons production. The speakers at last night's launch included Richard Weinberg, son of Alvin, the new foundation's namesake and the man who led the Oak Ridge thorium project until its untimely demise. He is also credited with designing the uranium pressurised water reactor that dominates today's nuclear industry, being one of the first scientists to warn about the risks of CO2 emissions and writing eloquently on how science and policy connect. There's no way to know whether LFTR technology will live up to its promoters' vision of safe mini reactors rolling off production lines in the 2020s at low enough prices – and in sufficient quantities – to completely change the global energy and emissions picture. But what I've found striking discussing and reading about the technology over the past few years is that no one seems to disagree that it's a good idea. There's no obvious scientific case why it couldn't work, and even many of the traditionally anti-nuclear green groups seem to be cautiously in favour – a point emphasised last night when Craig Bennett, policy and campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said he supported thorium research and wished the Weinberg group the best of luck. However, the NGO's head of science, policy and research wrote in a blogpost earlier this year that \"thorium nuclear reactors aren't going to be ready in time [to avoid dangerous climate change].\" Launching an advocacy group and winning support in principle is only a first step, of course. The harder bit will be persuading governments or investors to stump up the millions or billions needed to get the technology back up and running in prototype – and then commercialised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas-uk-davey","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-13T10:43:00Z","webTitle":"Fracking: is the UK right to go ahead? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas-uk-davey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/dec/13/fracking-shale-gas-uk-davey","fields":{"headline":"Fracking: is the UK right to go ahead?","bodyText":"My views on shale gas have not materially changed since I last examined the environmental impacts of fracking back in May. I'm not against it per se - I believe it can be part of the UK's energy mix, if it helps us to relinquish coal - but I do think we need to proceed with caution. I am, therefore, pleased to see in today's announcement by the UK government that in allowing the resumption of test drilling in Lancashire it can only do so with tight oversight and regulation. It appears obvious that we are still many years away from reaching the stage where shale gas is exploited commercially in the UK - and even when, or if, that moment arrives it will unlikely ever be on the scale seen in the US. Those that try to directly compare the US situation to the UK are, in large part, misinforming this important debate. There appear to be far more differences than similarities, in my view. An important next step after the excitement and anger that has greeted today's new is to establish much more information about precisely how much shale gas is recoverable. Until we do so, this debate will continue to be hindered by a fug of contradiction and confusion. And then we must digest the all-important report commissioned today by Decc that will examine the full carbon life-cycle of shale gas. What the government does with that information will present a far bigger decision than it has made today. As I referenced back in May when I last examined shale gas in the Eco Audit, it's worth recalling the report on shale gas published by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in January 2011 and updated late last year: Irrespective of whether UK shale gas substitutes for coal, renewables or imported gas, the industry's latest reserve estimates for just one licence area could account for up to 15% of the UK's emissions budget through to 2050. Therefore, emissions from a fully developed UK shale gas industry would likely be very substantial in their own right. If the UK government is to respect its obligations under both the Copenhagen accord and low carbon transition plan, shale gas offers no meaningful potential as even a transition fuel. Moreover, any significant and early development of the industry is likely to prove either economically unwise or risk jeopardising the UK's international reputation on climate change. Against such a quantifiable and stark evaluation, it is difficult to conclude other than the UK needs to invest in very low carbon energy supply if it is to both abide by its international obligations and support economically sustainable technologies. Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, has just posted a blog headlined: \"This fracking fantasy is the delusion of fossil fuel addiction\": This is nothing more than the delusion of addiction. Like all addictions, our fossil fuel craving tempts us to ignore inconvenient truths that threaten our next fix. The simple reality for shale gas in Europe is that no serious, independent authority, from the International Energy Agency down, thinks fracking will provide enough gas to dent its price in Europe. As the government's own advisers set out today, over-reliance on gas exposes consumers to far higher hikesin bills. Those memorably dubbed frack-heads by Andrew Rawnsley tend to ignore climate change but the prime minister did not. Instead, he prescribed the equivalent of a drug user dealing with a wild high by swallowing a fistful of downers. If the gas revolution did come to pass, Cameron said, then capturing and burying the emissions would deal with climate change. Yet fitting that expensive technology in order to burn \"cheap\" gas is like happily getting addicted to heroin because you can check into rehab later. Lawrence Carter, a Greenpeace climate campaigner, has written a piece for the New Statesman chiding the government - particularly George Osborne - for basing its pro-fracking energy policy on \"ideology rather than evidence\": So how likely is it that we’ll enjoy a US style fracking revolution here? Not very, say experts. Analysts at Deutsche Bank, the International Energy Agency (IEA), Ofgem, the European Commission, Chatham House and others, have all concluded that the fall in gas prices seen in the U.S. will not be replicated in Europe. Deutsche Bank, for example, concluded that “those waiting for a shale gas ‘revolution’ outside the US will likely be disappointed, in terms of both price and the speed at which high-volume production can be achieved”. While the IEA have outlined how European shale gas will be 50 per cent more expensive to extract. Yet Osborne is betting the farm, and the UK’s energy future, on fracking bringing costs down enough to make it economic to run almost half our power supply off gas... Precisely why Osborne has chosen to ignore the facts in order to pursue his dash for gas is for others to speculate. But for consumers up and down the UK, not to mention our attempts to tackle the urgent threat of climate change, it would be infinitely more reassuring if our energy policy was based on evidence rather than ideology. Cuadrilla, the private company given permission today to resume its fracking exploration in Lancashire, has, unsurprisingly, welcomed the news: Today’s news is a turning point for the country’s energy future. Shale gas has the potential to create jobs, generate tax revenues, reduce our reliance on imported gas, and improve our balance of payments,” said Francis Egan, CEO of Cuadrilla Resources. “Our exploration has shown that under Lancashire there is a belt of gas-filled shale over one mile thick. Today’s decision will allow continued exploration and testing of the UK’s very significant shale resources in a way that fulfils the highest environmental and community standards. Cuadrilla is pleased that Decc has recognized the major improvements it has made. The company is ready to move ahead with its plans, involving the hydraulic fracturing and flow testing of a number of wells in Lancashire in 2013. Before these further exploration and testing plans can proceed, Cuadrilla will work closely with Decc and its representatives, Lancashire County Council, the Environment Agency, the HSE, the local communities and other relevant parties to obtain regulatory approvals and planning permission. In cooperation with Decc, Cuadrilla has already taken a number of steps to further reduce environmental risk. Key among these is an advanced system for seismic monitoring that allows Cuadrilla and DECC to closely monitor and regulate hydraulic fracturing activity. The Wall Street Journal also has an interview with Cuadrilla's Francis Egan: Mr. Egan said that Cuadrilla, which obtained a license to explore in Lancashire in 2008, but had to halt fracking last year following minor earthquakes in the area, is spending \"several million pounds\" on advanced systems for seismic monitoring. It must also get approval from local authorities, a process that is likely to take several months, Mr. Egan said. Cuadrilla is expected to start fracking in the first half of next year in two or three wells, he said. There's lots of talk about how the shale gas \"revolution\" has caused natural gas prices in the US to plummet in recent years - and how it might/might not do the same in the UK. The US Department of Energy website has a useful section which lets you see industrial prices, wellhead prices and, crucially, residential prices across various time periods. Here's another indication that protestors will try to block any company seeking permission to frack for shale gas in the UK. A statement just released by Lilly Morse, a Frack Off campaigner: The long expected announcement that the government will allow fracking companies to continue attempts at exploitation of unconventional gas is the start of a major battle over what sort of world we will leave to our children. The government and industry’s promises of cheap, abundant gas are deluded. In the US the gas bubble has already burst with fracking companies on the verge of bankruptcy. Drilling has ground to a halt and gas prices have doubled since the beginning of the year. The governments strategy of relying on fracking to fuel a new wave of gas fired power stations is utterly insane. Fracking is dirty, destructive and extremely expensive, and could never deliver the quantities of gas envisaged. In the last year and a half, a growing number of communities have begun organising to oppose fracking. Those communities can now clearly see that if they do not win this fight they will be sacrificed for the profits of vested interests. The evidence from the US and Australia that fracking destroys water supplies, air quality, ecosystems, and people’s health has been mounting for years, and is now too strong to ignore. Waiting for even more impacts to be discovered is not an option. Dissent in the shires (namely, key constituencies for the Conservative party) is already surfacing at the news of fracking being allowed to resume. Here's some reaction in Sussex: Vanessa Vine, a Balcombe resident, of Frack Free Sussex (FFS), fears for the ecological future around the site as it is near the London to Brighton railway line, the River Ouse, Ardingly Reservoir, and a Grade II listed viaduct. “The threat is not only to our seismic security, but puts in jeopardy our wild ecology, our farmland and thereby our health, through industrialisation of our landscape and resultant contamination of soil, air and groundwater,” she said. “It beggars belief that our legislators appear set to allow hydraulic fracturing to be carried out.” Meanwhile, Paul Miner, senior planning officer at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: Before commercial scale extraction happens, there must be a full and transparent planning process. The government doesn’t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level. If fracking is to happen, it must be with the support of local communities, who are most at risk if things go wrong, and without damaging the countryside. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), which \"carries out world-class research into sustainable future energy systems\", has put out a press release containing reaction to Davey's announcement. It says the announcement \"should not be interpreted as a green light for wide spread commercial development of shale gas in the UK\": UKERC gas expert Professor Michael Bradshaw says: \"Only an exploratory drilling programme can provide the information needed to arrive at a better assessment of the reserve base, but the US experience suggests that even that will provide limited understanding. It is only by extensive drilling that commercial levels of production can be guaranteed. Any further decisions must assess the commercial viability of shale gas in the UK, against the regulatory costs and tax regime, the environmental impacts (both direct in relation to the drilling activity and indirect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions) and the wider societal acceptance of the industry. In short, shale gas will remain a conditional resource in the UK for some-time to come.\" Christophe McGlade helped conduct a UKERC review into shale gas resources, he reinforces this view saying: \"Estimates of technically recoverable resources are significantly more useful than the much more speculative and rather less helpful estimates of gas in place. Drilling will also aid estimation of the potential for economic recovery of these resources. Exploratory drilling will hence reduce the uncertainties that currently exist over the size of the UK resource base and allow a more evidence based discussion on the potential role of shale gas in the UK energy system.\" Professor Robert Mair, chair of the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering review of shale gas published earlier this year, has commented on today's announcement: We are pleased to see the government recognise the importance of the joint Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering report on the geological and environmental risks of shale gas extraction in the UK. We welcomed the opportunity to discuss our recommendations with the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Health and Safety Executive and Environment Agency recently and commend their commitment to implementing the recommendations set out in our report. Our report concluded that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation. It is now up to the government, regulatory bodies and operators to ensure that these responsibilities are met. Safeguarding well integrity is at the heart of ensuring that risks associated with hydraulic fracturing can be managed effectively. Our report highlighted the need for continued monitoring by independent experts to ensure that each well is designed, constructed and operated in a safe and responsible manner. We strongly encourage both the government and the operators to implement a properly independent examination and onsite inspection programme so that the public can have confidence in the process. The decision by Ed Davey to commission a study of the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change should be welcomed. There are few reliable estimates of the carbon footprint of shale gas extraction and potential methane leakages during the extraction process have been highlighted as a concern, as methane is a potent greenhouse gas. The findings of this study will be important in deciding the future of large scale extraction of shale gas in the UK. At the time the review was published, I wrote an article asking why it had failed to investigate the potential climate impact of exploiting shale gas reserves. I still find the omission rather mystifying, given its obvious significance. If you want a better sense of where other than Lancashire shale gas could be fracked in the UK, it's worth taking a look at these maps and charts produced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change last year. (The British Geological Survey has a handy page on all this, too.) When I spoke to the BGS earlier this week, it said that it is currently only producing an estimate of the gas potentially recoverable in the Bowland Shales. This geological formation spreads from underneath Lancashire out to the eastern Irish sea and across to the western section of the North Sea. The BGS believes that it is \"thickest\" under the Irish Sea, but, to date, fracking is only being considered onshore. The BGS also admitted to me that its previous reserve estimates (as much as 150bn cubic metres) had been \"back of the fag packet\" in comparison to the report it is preparing for Decc at the moment. It is worth noting, though, its conclusion when it produced its 2010 estimate (pdf): Even if one assumes that the American shale gas producing analogies are valid, many of the operating conditions are different in the UK. In the UK, land owners do not own mineral rights, so there is less incentive to support development, and local authorities must grant planning consent. The US has relatively permissive environmental regulations, low population densities, tax incentives, existing infrastructure, well developed supply chains and access to technology. Cumulatively, these factors mean that it is far from certain that the conditions that underpin shale gas production in North America will be replicable in the UK. The BGS also told me that it is possibly better to look at how shale gas is being exploited in Poland, rather than the US: \"It's a window into where the UK might be in 5-6 years.\" Here's a video of Ed Hough, a BGS geologist, talking about shale gas in the UK... And if you really want to, er, drill down into this subject, here's a 40-minute presentation about shale gas in the UK given in June by Prof Mike Stephenson, the BGS's head of energy... The International Energy Agency is not due to launch its \"Medium-Term Coal Market Report-2012\" until next Tuesday. (Yes, don't tell me: you all had it in your diaries already). However, a press release giving a taster of the report has already surfaced online: The international coal market is experiencing dynamic changes. In 2011, China alone accounted for more than three-quarters of incremental coal production, while domestic consumption was more than three times that of global trade. Low gas prices associated with the shale gas revolution caused a marked decrease in coal use in the United States, the world’s second-largest consumer. This led US thermal coal producers to seek other markets, which resulted in an oversupply of coal in Europe and a significant gas-to-coal switch. Is the IEA report really going to argue that the US shale gas \"revolution\" (a term David Cameron was keen to adopt this week when discussing the UK's shale gas prospects) has, somewhat perversely, led to an increase in coal use in Europe?! If so, that would be an unfortunate - and unforeseen - side effect. Michael Liebreich, CEO of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, published some interesting analysis on shale gas at the end of October and, in particular, its likely impact on UK energy prices: There is no reason to believe that it will push gas prices down in the UK in the same way as they have recently in the U.S. Shale gas has been an astonishing success story there, within a few years shifting the country from being a long-term gas importer to a potential exporter, and pushing prices down from $6-11 per mmBtu to as low as $1.73 in April. There are caveats. The U.S. gas price has rebounded by over 90 percent from its lows, and is now around $3.50 per mmBtu. Some wells can make money at very low prices, though most cannot. As Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil Corp.’s chief executive, recently said of the U.S. shale gas miracle: “We are all losing our shirts today. You know, we’re making no money. It’s all in the red.”  The fact is that shale gas operators in the US need a gas price of around $5 per mmBtu in order to justify continuing to drill, frack and build pipelines. All analysts expect the U.S. natural gas price to rise to $5 or $6 per mmBtu. Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s own predictions are for a price of $5.50 by end-2015. And that is in the US, where conditions are ideal for shale gas: great geology, low population density, an existing pipeline network, a fragmented regulatory environment, landowners with sub-surface mineral rights and a liquid market for rigs and drilling services. Given conditions in the U.K., it is hard to see shale gas coming to market at much below $8 per mmBtu – around the same as the wholesale prices that have been driving up utility bills in recent years.  He continues: In order to replace the decline of UK Continental Shelf gas production through 2030 – before starting to replace any coal or nuclear power – you would need 2,400 fracked wells. Assume 10 wells per pad, and that is 240 pads. Each one is an industrial development in the countryside, and this number would extend over an area the size of Lancashire. In terms of production per well, at its peak, one fracked well can produce enough gas to match the output of 50 onshore or 15 offshore wind turbines. However, the decline curve of a fracked well is so steep that within two years, each well could replace as few as four onshore or one offshore turbine (and yes, these figures are adjusted for the efficiency of gas generation and the intermittency of wind). Here's Ed Davey making his Commons statement earlier on the resumption of fracking... And here's the BBC News channel discussing the news with Mark Wallace of the Institute of Directors, who says the \"government has made the right decision\"... Over on the Guardian's Comment is Free, a Debate of the Day has just launched. Much like this Eco Audit, it is asking: \"Fracking for shale gas: the right way forward?\". It features Mark Lynas, the environmental author, and David Santillo, senior scientist for Greenpeace. Here's a taster... Lynas: Gas is a cleaner fuel than coal, but because coal is currently cheaper than gas the UK's carbon emissions are higher than they need to be. Shale gas could reverse this situation as it has in the US, where coal is in decline and emissions are falling. In the longer term, however, gas-fired power stations should be required to capture their emissions through carbon capture and storage technologies. Santillo: It appears that the greenhouse gas \"footprint\" of shale gas may be significantly greater than for conventional gas and has even be claimed by some to be worse than coal. Greenpeace is therefore opposed to the exploitation of unconventional gas reserves until the impacts are fully investigated, understood, addressed and regulated. We call for significant more effort to be put into understanding the full impacts of fracking. It is becoming clear that any company seeking to frack for shale gas in the UK will be met with resistance from local campaigners and environmental groups. This seems to be reflected in a recent report (pdf) on \"anti-fracking activisim\" published by Control Risks, an \"independent, global risk consultancy specialising in helping organisations manage political, integrity and security risks in complex and hostile environments\". On pg 15 of the report it describes the risk in the UK as \"significant\". It describes \"significant\" as meaning: Activist groups are well-organised and actively network internationally. Campaigns are directed specifically against unconventional gas development. Social activism poses considerable political risks and moderate operational and security risks to unconventional gas development. Meanwhile, I've just been sent this note by the Fuel Poverty Action: Shame on Ed Davey for caving in to the Big Six energy companies and George Osborne. People across the UK will suffer at the hands of Davey's spinelessness. Fracking means higher fuel bills, earthquakes and cancer, as well as spelling disaster for the climate. In contrast, renewables are clean, safe and would save the average household £500 off their fuel bills over the coming decades. There is overwhelming public support for renewables over gas - our democracy is being trampled over while we're ripped off and left to freeze. We're furious and we're going to fight back. If you missed the fracking debate on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, you can listen here. It included David Kennedy, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, and John Hofmeister, a former Shell executive in the US and founder of Citizens for Affordable Energy. And with handy timing, the Committee on Climate Change has published a report today examining the impacts of meeting carbon budgets on energy prices and bills. It doesn't seem to be sold on the idea that fracking automatically leads to cheaper energy bills (nor that it would help the UK meet its carbon targets): The value of a low-carbon portfolio will depend on future gas prices, which are not expected to fall in the UK, and carbon prices, which are expected to rise: • The International Energy Agency’s projections for European gas prices in the 2020s suggest that these would be in line with DECC’s central scenario (i.e. slightly higher than currently and broadly flat from 2020, at around 70 p/therm) under a world with significant utilisation of unconventional (e.g. shale) gas resources (Figure 5.1). If the extraction of unconventional gas is more limited, then costs would rise to 2030 (i.e. to reach around 85 p/therm in 2030). • The Government’s carbon price underpin implies an acceleration in carbon prices in the 2020s (i.e. this is set to rise from £32/tCO2 in 2020 to £76/tCO2 in 2030. Beyond this, the Government’s carbon values assume rising carbon costs to around £200/tCO2 in 2050, whilst global carbon price modelling suggests significantly higher prices are also possible (e.g. modelling for the Committee by UCL suggests that carbon prices in 2050 could reach around £500/tCO2 even with an active global carbon market taking advantage of trading opportunities to minimise global abatement costs, see Figure 5.2). (Go to pg 55 of the PDF of the report for the figures referenced above.) Earlier this week, Boris Johnson, London's mayor, came out firmly in favour of fracking with characteristic aplomb and verve in his Telegraph column: In their mad denunciations of fracking, the Greens and the eco-warriors betray the mindset of people who cannot bear a piece of unadulterated good news. Beware this new technology, they wail. Do not tamper with the corsets of Gaia! Don’t probe her loamy undergarments with so much as a finger — or else the goddess of the earth will erupt with seismic revenge. Dig out this shale gas, they warn, and our water will be poisoned and our children will be stunted and our cattle will be victims of terrible intestinal explosions. Damian Kahya at Greenpeace's Energy Desk has now produced a rather handy fact-checker analysing Johnson's 10 key claims. Many thanks to all those who've already posted comments below. Plenty of interest and debate already... DoctorChris: The critical issue will be how much fugitive methane escapes when the gas is produced, and how much CO2 will be released when the gas is burned. Shale gas from fracking should have to pay for any climate change impacts that these cause, at about £60 per tonne for the CO2, and perhaps 20 times that for any methane released. londonlandlord: If the country starts capturing the global warming gas carbon dioxide from coal power plants and injecting it underground, there is a potential for a larger quakes given the amount of the heat-trapping gas that would have to be buried That's an issue that needs more study. When are we going to hear \"concerns\" about the above? EnviroCapitalist: It seems to have taken an awful long time to reach this decision. Britain is going to be reliant on gas for a long time to come. This is even more the case if there is a substantial investment in renewables, which will need substantial backup capacity. Even the technical people at FoE and Greenpeace accept this - though their political people don't mention this. The only way to escape gas would be to go all out for nuclear power, which isn't going to happen. At the same time, Britian is currently producing 40% of its electricity from coal. Replacing this with gas is an instant environmental win. Replacing this with local gas is an instant economic win. We also use a lot of gas for heating - heating with anything else is a long way off. Better that our gas is locally produced gas rather than Russian gas or Qatari gas. Yes, standards of production need to be high and verified. Caudrilla say all the right things on their website, but this will need to be verified. The gas won't be very cheap, but that is because of the work needed to extract it - which means jobs. I've spotted some details within the various statements and documents released by Decc that are likely to further fuel the debate over fracking in the UK. For example, here are a few snippets from Davey's statement that caught my eye: So far as Cuadrilla’s current exploration programme in Lancashire is concerned, the remedial action level for the traffic light system (that is, the “red light”) will be set at magnitude 0.5 (far below a perceptible surface event, but larger than the expected level generated by the fracturing of the rock). I consider that this is an appropriately precautionary approach. We received representations in our consultation that this is too cautious. Given that Cuadrilla caused a 2.3 magnitude tremor during its previous wave of test drilling (and it lobbied for a 1.7 limit), how will this new 0.5 \"red light\" affect its forthcoming exploration? Other concerns which have been expressed are not to do with the current phase of exploration work but with the implications of a possible future move to production operations, if the exploration is successful. It is by no means certain that any such operations will ever be proposed, but if they were, a different set of considerations would arise... This is a big reminder by Davey that he has only granted the resumption of exploration, not production. A big difference. In other words, there are still many hurdles to clear before the UK sees fracking on the scale currently seen in the US. So far as the use of chemicals is concerned, the environment agencies take a risk-based approach to the regulation of the use of chemicals in shale gas fracking activities. The hazard potential of all substances proposed to be injected into the ground will be assessed and the use of substances hazardous to groundwater will not be permitted. The identity of all substances proposed for injection, and the agency’s conclusions on their hazard potential, will be publicly available. In the US, the secrecy by some companies about the chemicals they use during fracking has caused considerable disquiet and distrust. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the UK government will insist such information is made public. Concern has also been expressed about the quantities of water used in fracking, or the disposal of waste water from the process. The water used may of course be obtained from licensed suppliers, but if directly abstracted by the operators, requires a licence from the environment agency. Licences will only be given where the agency is satisfied that a sustainable supply is obtainable. Equally, disposal of waste water is subject to scrutiny by the agencies and will require a permit. The waste water from the operations in Lancashire has been found to contain low levels of radioactivity. A case-specific radiological assessment is required in support of any application for a permit for the disposal of radioactive waste. The agency will critically review any such assessment, and will only issue a permit if satisfied. Expect the issue of water contamination to be a key battleground for environmentalists and local communities keen to stop fracking. DECC has come to the conclusion that Cuadrilla’s response to the occurrence of the tremors demonstrated some weaknesses in its management of environmental risks. This conclusion has been discussed with the company, and they have in consequence reinforced their overall management structure, including by assigning to one board member specific responsibility for health and safety measures, and by reinforcing technical skills within the operational team. The effectiveness of these changes, and the resulting revised structure, is at present being reviewed for Cuadrilla by external consultants. Davey is clearly indicating that Cuadrilla has been placed on the naughty step and will be watched very closely indeed by regulators. One further slip up by Cuadrilla could be disastrous for the prospects of fracking in the UK. I intend to commission a study into the possible impacts of shale gas extraction on greenhouse gas emissions. This will consider the available evidence on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from shale gas exploitation, and the need for further research. I have invited Professor David Mackay, my Department’s Chief Scientific Adviser and Dr Tim Stone, the Expert Chair of the Office of Nuclear Development to undertake this work. Arguably, this is the key environmental question hanging over fracking. This study should have, perhaps, been commissioned before the green-light was given by Davey, but, nonetheless, plenty of attention and scrutiny will be give to the Mackay and Stone report when it is published. We are also taking steps to prepare the way for any future production phase, though this is likely to be some years away. We have commissioned more detailed work on the shale gas resources of Great Britain from the British Geological Survey (BGS) and this will be published early next year. I emphasise that this will provide only an estimate of the resource, the gas in the ground, and not the reserves, the amount of gas which can in practice be produced economically from that resource. Until more exploration work has been done, a significant number of wells fracked and production patterns established over time, it will not be possible to make any meaningful estimate of likely economically recoverable resources of shale gas in the United Kingdom. Again, another key part of Davey's statement. There is currently lots of noise being generated, particularly by shale gas enthusiasts, about the \"game-changing\" amounts of it under the ground waiting to be exploited. But it is little more than optimistic guesswork, at present. Until Decc publishes the BGS report in, as I've been told, January, treat any firm statements about the quantity and quality of \"gas in place\" and \"recoverable reserves\" (there's a huge difference between the two) with extreme caution. And even then, the BGS is telling me that its report will still be an estimate based, in part, on Cuadrilla's \"gas content\" figures from its 2-3 test rigs. The BGS admits it needs data from dozens, if not hundreds, of wells to make a more accurate estimate. Finally, I haven't had a chance to fully go through this Q&amp;A on fracking (pdf) posted by Decc, but I did spot this on pg 31: Why would the UK exploit shale gas when it is clearly not aligned to managing global warming? Shale gas production would in the first place replace declining offshore gas production and reduce reliance on external supplies. Beyond that point, use of gas could displace use of coal in generation, with a positive effect on GHG reduction (provided fugitive emissions are subject to proper controls as outlined above). Investment in shale gas must be at the expense of investment in renewables? It is too early to say whether shale gas will be able to contribute significantly to our sources of gas supplies for the future. But the recently published gas generation strategy confirms that the government sees a significant role for gas into the future; while continuing development of renewable supply will be essential to meeting our targets for renewables and wider climate change goals. I don't know about you, but I find these answers far too vague to be reassuring. Reaction to Davey's announcement is arriving at a furious pace. I will try to include as much as I can as the day continues, but here's a taster: Dr Nick Riley, head of science policy (Europe) at the British Geological Survey: Drilling and testing for shale gas will allow Britain to assess whether we have an economic resource and how it can be accessed with minimum impact to the environment. Gas is the greenest of the fossil fuels and may have a role in reducing carbon emissions in countries which are dependent on coal for electricity generation, but shale gas also has high emissions from all the energy used in drilling and fracking. If gas power generation is connected with carbon capture and storage the convenience of home grown gas can be combined with very low emissions to help keep Britain within its emissions targets. Prof Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh: The UK undoubtedly has some shale gas resource and, if the relevant environmental regulations and monitoring are enforced, this can be a lower carbon source of fossil energy than imported gas. Fracking is well established in the subsurface industry, and monitoring should greatly reduce the risk of earth tremor. High quality well casing and sealing of drilling fluids and gas production from surrounding aquifers is equally important, as is control of fugitive emissions. However, I expect the rollout of shale gas in the UK to be a lot slower than the Treasury hope for, and not to control the price of domestic gas supplies. Mónica Cristina, spokeswoman of Shale Gas Europe: We welcome unreservedly this momentous decision which has potential to create jobs and enhance energy security in Europe. While there continues to be intense speculation around risks, there is now substantial scientific evidence to support the UK government’s decision. In June 2012 the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering concluded that the health, safety and environmental risks associated with the technique can be effectively managed. There are significant potential opportunities, as the British Geological Survey estimates UK shale gas resources maybe 50 per cent larger than conventional gas resources. Today’s announcement follows the European Parliament’s rejection of a Europe-wide moratorium on shale gas development on 21 November 2012. It highlights that the UK is ready to move forward with the sustainable development of its domestic natural gas resources following a thorough review of its impact. The UK now has the opportunity to further secure its gas supply, boost jobs and economic activity while reducing CO2 emissions when replacing higher carbon content fuels. Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth: Giving the green light to fracking for shale gas will send shock waves across the UK. Communities up and down the country will be disturbed by this reckless decision which threatens to contaminate our air and water and undermine national climate targets. George Osborne’s short-sighted dash for gas will leave the country dependent on dirty fossil fuels – MPs must stand up for a safe and affordable future by insisting on clean British energy from the wind, waves and sun. Ben Caldecott, head of policy, Climate Change Capital: Fracking will continue to generate significant local opposition, which will undermine long term political support and the investment case for a UK shale gas expansion. This is fortunate, as it's clear from the latest Committee on Climate Change findings that another dash for gas will expose us to higher and more volatile fuel prices. Before we start in earnest, here are the essential links that have been uploaded onto Decc's website this morning following Davey's announcement... Written Ministerial Statement by Edward Davey: Exploration for Shale Gas Update 13 Dec 2012 - New controls on seismic risks permit a resumption of shale gas exploration Government response to Royal Academy of Engineers and Royal Society report on “Shale Gas Extraction in the UK: a review of hydraulic fracturing” Synopsis of main questions raised in responses to DECC consultation on mitigation of seismic risks from hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, with government responses Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has set out this morning why he is allowing the resumption of fracking for shale gas in UK. He said that fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - can only resume with new safeguards to address the risk of seismic activity: Having carefully reviewed the evidence with the aid of independent experts, and with the aid of an authoritative review of the scientific and engineering evidence on shale gas extraction conducted by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society, I have concluded that appropriate controls are available to mitigate the risks of undesirable seismic activity. Those new controls will be required by my Department for all future shale gas wells. On that basis, I am in principle prepared to consent to new fracking proposals for shale gas, where all other necessary permissions and consents are in place. This opens the way to a resumption of work on exploration for shale gas, though I stress the importance of the other regulatory consents, and planning permission, which are also necessary for these activities, and which must be in place before my Department will consider consent to individual operations. In practice, it will be well into next year before any new exploration work has all the necessary consents to proceed. Whether any production operations may be proposed will depend on the success of the exploration work, but, in any event, this is likely to be some years away yet. The widely expected move comes amid a fierce debate in the UK about the merits and dangers of fracking. Some say it is safe and will lead to cheaper energy. Others say it presents too many environmental hazards and is unlikely to force down gas prices, as it has done in the US. Is the UK government right to give the green-light - with conditions - to fracking exploration in Lancashire and, potentially, beyond? Please leave your thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/feb/17/breakeven-low-carbon-barrel-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-17T16:28:00Z","webTitle":"Break-even for low-carbon economy is $100 a barrel oil, says Chris Huhne | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/feb/17/breakeven-low-carbon-barrel-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/feb/17/breakeven-low-carbon-barrel-oil","fields":{"headline":"Break-even for low-carbon economy is $100 a barrel oil, says Chris Huhne","bodyText":"The UK's ambitious low-carbon energy plans will mean energy consumers paying lower bills in 2020 if oil is over $100 per barrel, compared to a fossil-fuelled future. That price is the break-even point, said the energy and climate change secretary, Chris Huhne, today. I think it is an important number, because it clearly shows why a failure to invest the large sums of money needed into renewable energy, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage would be a false economy. Here's what he told a conference at the Royal Geographical Society in London today. Bear in mind the price of oil (Brent crude) is $104 as I write: If we relied on oil and gas, and the price stayed relatively low at $80 a barrel then consumers will pay more under our policies – about an extra 1% on their bills by 2020. At the oil price reached this month - $100 a barrel or more – consumers will pay less through the low carbon energy policies than they would pay for fossil fuel policies. And if the US administration is right, and the price is $108 a barrel in 2020, then our consumers are winning hands down. So, as Huhne put it, when people say the energy policies his government are pursuing are far too costly, the reply is \"hang on, what is this other world?\" Predicting oil prices is a black art of course, but the question is do you think the price of oil is going to remain flat for the next nine years? He also made another argument for low carbon energy investment: insulation from oil and gas price shocks. He said: I asked economists at DECC to look at how a 1970s style oil price shock would play out today. They found that if the oil price doubled, it could lead to a cumulative loss of GDP of around £45 billion over 2 years. [The oil price rose fivefold in the 1970s]. And this is not just far-off speculation: it is a threat here and now. The Office of Budget Responsibility forecast that if oil prices rose by 20% - as they have since October – the total cost to the economy would be £4.5bn. Oil and gas will play an important role in the low-carbon shift. But in the long term, getting off the oil hook will make our economy more independent, more secure and more stable. We rightly hear a lot about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and are promised that the UK's economic recovery should include an industrial resurgence based on clean technology. In terms of the three crucial tests of energy policy - low carbon, security and cost - it's the latter that had been least convincing, making the arguments above significant. One other part of the speech stuck out for me: more startling numbers from China, which just might change the world with its new five year economic plan. China is undoubtedly running fastest in the race for leadership in green technology. Huhne reeled the numbers off - China's $34bn pumped into the low-carbon economy in 2009 - by way of arguing that even if the UN climate talks look like dragging on for years, some countries were acting anyway. These two stuck out for me: China will build 24 nuclear power stations in the time it takes us to build one. By 2020, their nuclear capacity will have increased tenfold. They will complete 16,000km of high-speed rail in the time it takes us to go from London to Birmingham. Does a low carbon future really look so scary? Note: I'm off on holiday, so there'll be no blogposts next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/01/isle-of-wight-windfarm-dogma","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-01T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Isle of Wight proposal exposes dogma of windfarm argument","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/01/isle-of-wight-windfarm-dogma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/01/isle-of-wight-windfarm-dogma","fields":{"headline":"Isle of Wight proposal exposes dogma of windfarm argument","bodyText":"The trouble with wind, said Dave Green, is it polarises opinion. \"People get dogmatic,\" said the man whose job it is to make the Isle of Wight energy self-sufficient within a decade. \"They fixate on the wrong things. It all gets very confrontational.\" He's not wrong. In Wellow and Thorley, adjoining ribbons of attractive stone cottages and neat1970s bungalows strung along a quiet country B road in West Wight, half the buildings sport protest signs and a dozen more are for sale. South lies a broad sweep of open field rising to the windswept ridge of Tapnell Down. North is the Solent, studded with white sails. It is as fine and as English a landscape as you could wish for, bordered on three sides by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. And on this field a firm called Infinergy, a subsidiary of the Dutch renewable energy group KDE Energy, has submitted proposals to build five wind turbines standing 65 metres tall to the top of their towers. The blade tips will rotate 100 metres above ground level. Together, Infinergy says, the turbines will generate up to 12.5 megawatts – enough to meet the electricity needs of 6,400 homes a year, 11% of the island's households. The figures do not interest the residents of Wellow and Thorley. \"The nearest one to us will be in line with that,\" says Steve Pearce, gesturing at a telegraph pole just outside his house. \"And from where we're standing, it'll look about as big. A hundred metres to blade-tip? Think about it.\" Pearce's wife, Mandy, was concerned about the strobe effect in the front garden. \"Look at the afternoon sun now, the length of our shadows,\" she says. \"Now imagine it flickering, constantly. That's what it'll be like. Imagine.\" Down the road, Anthony Hayter, a Thorley resident since 1963, was worried about the noise (\"We stopped at a windfarm in France and listened; shoosh, shoosh, shoosh\") and the upheaval: \"For each one, you need a concrete base the size of an Olympic swimming pool.\" Cathy Gibbs is pruning her hedge. \"They're just way too big for here, way too big for the island,\" she says. \"All this has put a blight on both villages – it's like people's lives are on hold. None of these houses on the market are selling.\" Local opposition to the Vectis windfarm project, the second on this site (an earlier proposal was rejected in 2006) seems, essentially, aesthetic. Few residents are swayed by the charges so often levelled at wind power: intermittent, unreliable, inefficient, expensive. Tales of spectacularly exploding turbines and blades turning either too fast or not at all leave them unmoved. They're all in favour of renewable energy, they say: in the right place, wind turbines can look \"quite beautiful\", says Gibbs. And on an island scoured by powerful, harnessable tides and bathed in more sun than anywhere else in Britain, Steve Pearce adds, much more could and should be done: \"Even with four kids, we're now generating at least half our electricity from solar.\" They just don't want five 100-metre turbines half a mile from their front door. \"The landscape's the prime objection,\" says Malcolm Peplow, chair of the island's vocal and well-organised opposition group ThWART (The Wight Against Rural Turbines), whose house stands 530 metres from the proposed site of the nearest windmill. \"We believe there's no benefit to the local community, and considerable potential to damage the tourist trade. But primarily, we feel turbines of this size are totally out of scale with the intimate landscape of the island.\" It is a stance the project's supporters cannot stomach. Jude Ashley-Walker, 64, says she may well be \"the only person in Wellow\" who backs the project (she feels so strongly about it that she summoned me to her post-operative hospital bedside in Newport to talk about it). She doesn't trust ThWART's motives. \"Their real beef is money. They're worried about property values. A lot of them are my generation, and we're the ones who've pillaged the planet,\" she says. \"It's shameful that we can be sitting there now saying, 'I don't care, I won't be around to see the consequences.'\" Wind energy, Ashley-Walker says, \"isn't the answer, but it is part of the solution. And we have to start, now. This isn't like the nuclear missile threat in the 70s, this isn't a 'maybe'. We're heading for lights out. How can people be more worried about their bank balances than their grandchildren's future?\" In the George Inn in Newport, half a dozen supporters have gathered. There's bitterness and ill-feeling; claims that ThWART are \"rich bullies\" and \"professional agitators\"; claims that the protest group, which has campaigned vigorously against several onshore windfarm proposals on the Wight, has commercial reasons for opposing wind power on the island. (It is true, it seems, that a number of former ThWART directors are now involved in proposals for a biomass plant on the island. Peplow says they are no longer members of the protest group's board; ThWART, he adds, is a genuine, grassroots organisation with 3,000 perfectly ordinary members– and perennially strapped for cash.) Mainly, though, those assembled in the George do not buy its argument. \"My son's 18, and I don't want his future risked because we've run out of energy,\" says Lois Prior, who regularly spends her weekends in the main square in Newport handing out letters in support of wind power for passersby to sign and send to the council's planning committee. \"The writing's on the wall. If we carry on as we are, we'll be looking out at the landscape from pitch-black homes. Frankly, I'd rather have turbines for 25 years, then they'll be gone. Technology will have moved on.\" Stewart Blackmore, manager of Ventnor golf club, agrees. He has submitted a proposal for a single 70-metre high turbine on its 40 hectares (100 acres). The proceeds, estimated at around £300,000, could pay for a much-needed refurbishment of the clubhouse, and holiday chalets to provide jobs and secure the club's future. The landscape, Blackmore says, \"has always changed. Once it was covered in forest; 200 years ago there were thousands of windmills.\" No energy source is ever 100% efficient, he says, nor entirely unsubsidised. Wind power \"isn't expensive taken in the round, and certainly isn't expensive if you take into account the consequences of not doing it\". It would be madness, he adds, not to capitalise on \"one of the best wind profiles in the country outside west Scotland. The wind doesn't stop blowing, and it's free. In Ventnor, it blows at nine metres a second; the cut-in for a viable wind turbine is 4.5.\" There are more cautious voices; Tanja Rebel says what is need most is \"a sea change in the way we use energy. I believe in small scaleness, in everything we do\". But many here – a majority of 10 to 1, according to a poll for the island radio station – agree with Dave Arbuthnott, a former employee and occupier of Vestas, the wind turbine manufacturer that controversially closed its blade production facility on the island in 2009. \"It's not whether,\" he says, \"it's what. If I had to choose between 20 wind turbines on the Downs or a nuclear power station, I know what I'd go for. Wind isn't ultra efficient, but it's getting more efficient all the time, and it's clean. We need it now.\" Try telling that, though, to the people of Wellow and Thorley. As Dave Green says, when it comes to wind power, \"people get dogmatic; entrenched\". Bearded and boundlessly enthusiastic, he heads the ambitious and pioneering EcoIsland project that aims to make the Isle of Wight Britain's first truly sustainable region: self-sufficient in energy, water, food and fuel. Even Green agrees there are \"questions about embedded energy, carbon footprint, what actual windfarms produce, the total cost-benefit equation\". But wind, he says, has to be part of the energy mix we need if we are not to face a future of rationing and blackouts. \"The problem here,\" he said, \"is not the concept, but the location. If five turbines in West Wight could keep the lights on in Yarmouth, I'd be hard pressed to say no to them. But of course I see this is sensitive. I can't argue with the residents' right to say they don't want those turbines so close to their homes.\" His main fear is that \"petty squabbles\" over \"20-year-old technologies\" will take our collective eye off the ball. \"We can't get caught up. The technology is advancing; sustainable solutions are round the corner. But people must wake up to the imperative, find what's right for them. They shouldn't be arguing, they should be coming up with ideas.\" In the meantime, Infinergy's proposal is with the planning services department of the Isle of Wight council. No date has been set for a decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/feb/05/sweden-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-05T17:16:49Z","webTitle":"Sweden lifts ban on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/05/sweden-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/feb/05/sweden-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Sweden lifts ban on nuclear power","bodyText":"Nuclear power received a significant boost today when the Swedish government announced plans to overturn a near 30-year ban on atomic plants as part of a new drive to increase energy security and combat global warming. Ministers said they would present a bill on 17 March which would allow the construction of nuclear reactors on existing sites and introduce a new carbon tax as part of a programme to cut carbon emissions by 40% on 1990 levels by 2020. The decision is significant because Sweden was at the forefront of anti-nuclear sentiment following the Three Mile Island accident in America in 1979 and voted in a referendum a year later to phase out its existing stations. It also coincides with a statement today from Fortum Corporation that it wanted to build a second new atomic plant near Helsinki in Finland. The company is already building the first new nuclear station in Europe for more than 30 years. Fredrik Reinfeld, the Swedish prime minister, said he did not feel bound by his nation's previous referendum result because it did not specify how the power from the nuclear stations should be replaced, but the government must still convince parliament before it is turned into law. The proposal was made possible after a compromise by the Center party, a junior coalition member which has long held a sceptical stance toward nuclear power. \"I'm doing this for the sake of my children and grandchildren,\" said Center party leader, Maud Olofsson. \"I can live with the fact that nuclear power will be part of our electricity supply system in the foreseeable future.\" This follows a series of public opinion polls indicating a change in sentiment as the country becomes increasingly dependent on energy imports from Norway and climate change has become a matter of increasing concern. Sweden's 10 nuclear reactors at three plants – Oskarshamn, Ringhals and Forsmark – supply roughly half of the country's electricity, while two other reactors at the Barseback site have been closed over the past decade. The country has been at the forefront of efforts to find ways of burying the highly toxic waste produced during the nuclear cycle. The current generation of nuclear generating plants around the world came into operation between 1972 and 1985 but the industry fell into disrepute with the public following the Three Mile Island accident and the image of nuclear was further tarnished when there was a meltdown at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine seven years later. But since then there have been no scares and climate change has risen up the global agenda. Nuclear power emits virtually no carbon although critics claim significant amounts of CO2 are released if one takes into account the mining of uranium and other aspects of any full-lifecycle programme. Finland is the first to European country to start to construct a new nuclear plant, and has been followed by France. Britain is preparing for new reactors to be constructed to replace those coming to the end of their useful lives. Germany - like Sweden - has been seen as a firm opponent of atomic power but chancellor, Angela Merkel, has made clear that she too thinks a new debate should take place on whether new plants should be constructed. Environmentalists opposed to nuclear power said the decision in Sweden was one taken by a small majority in parliament and did not represent a significant swing back to favour for atomic power. \"No way can this be seen as a ringing endorsement given the parties concerned only hold 180 of 349 seats. The largest party in Sweden is still against nuclear and the people are not enamoured by it either,\" said Jean McSorley, a senior nuclear adviser at Greenpeace. McSorley believed the construction of an new nuclear plants would be hampered by the long lead times and huge expense at a time when the global recession means money is in short supply. \"There are very long lead times for new nuclear plants giving plenty of time for faults to emerge,\" she explained, noting that the Finnish reactor, Olkiluoto 3 currently under construction, has already fallen behind schedule and is over cost. Nuclear consultant John Large said it was not very surprising that Sweden should want to recommit to nuclear. \"If you looked at the wording of the moratorium it was was pretty liberally worded. I think [the latest decision] is as much to do with being overly dependent on Norway for power than the fight against climate change.\" But Swedish ministers also outlined plans to lift the proportion of renewable energy consumption to 50% of the total.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has decided to give up on its aim of returning the seabed near the plant to a \"pristine condition\". To do so, it said, could cause \"more harm than good\". At a board meeting in Stirling on Tuesday, the Scottish government's environmental watchdog opted to encourage remediation \"as far as is practically achievable\" but to abandon any hope of removing all the radioactive pollution from the seabed. Tens of thousands of radioactive fuel fragments escaped from the Dounreay plant between 1963 and 1984, polluting local beaches, the coastline and the seabed. Fishing has been banned within a two-kilometre radius of the plant since 1997. The most radioactive of the particles are regarded by experts as potentially lethal if ingested. Similar in size to grains of sand, they contain caesium-137, which has a half-life of 30 years, but they can also incorporate traces of plutonium-239, which has a half-life of over 24,000 years – meaning that is the time period for half of the material to break down. The particles are milled shards from the reprocessing of irradiated uranium and plutonium fuel from two long-defunct reactors. They are thought to have drained into the sea with discharges from cooling ponds. In 2007, Dounreay, which is now being decommissioned, pleaded guilty at Wick sheriff court to a \"failure to prevent fragments of irradiated nuclear fuel being discharged into the environment\". The plant's operator at the time, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, was fined £140,000. Since 2008, over 2,300 radioactive particles have been recovered from the seabed, with 351 removed by a remotely operated underwater vehicle this summer. Since 1983, over 480 particles have also been found on three local beaches and the Dounreay foreshore. Sepa recommended in 1998 that the seabed around Dounreay should be returned to a \"pristine condition\". Since then, it pointed out, the contamination had been extensively investigated and new regulations on radioactively contaminated land had come into force. \"It is now widely accepted that a literal return to a pristine condition is a far from simple or even achievable concept,\" a Sepa spokeswoman told the Guardian. \"Trying to achieve it might also cause more harm than good. There is the potential that ecosystems may be destroyed on trying to get to something which does not pose a significant hazard.\" An expert committee set up by Sepa warned in 2006 that disturbing the seabed could cause particles to escape and be swept ashore, putting members of the public at risk. The most radioactive particle found \"could have had life-threatening consequences if it had been ingested\", the committee said. Sepa's board agreed to change its policy to encourage further remediation \"provided that this achieves more good than harm and accepting that at some sites it will not be practical to return the land to a pristine condition\". Dounreay, which is now managed by a consortium including the UK engineering firm Babcock, welcomed Sepa's new policy. It was still aiming to remove \"the majority of the most hazardous particles, together with the removal of any other particles encountered,\" said the site's senior project manager, Phil Cartwright. \"The best practicable environmental option, which was welcomed by the government agencies, is focused on doing more good than harm and was publicly discussed on the basis that it would never be possible to retrieve every particle.\" Friends of the Earth Scotland, however, attacked the development. \"Once again, we see the nuclear industry causing a problem it can't solve, and dumping the cost and consequence on the rest of us,\" said the environmental group's chief executive, Stan Blackley. \"Nuclear power is neither safe, clean, cheap nor low-carbon and it continues to cause problems and cost the taxpayer a hidden and open-ended fortune.

Nevertheless, on my \"Big Winter's Day\" at the start of the new year, it proved surprisingly productive for birds. The rising tide was pushing little flocks of waders up the beach, including oystercatchers, redshanks and turnstones, the latter beautifully camouflaged as they fed on the exposed rocks. Just offshore some mallard and pintail – birds usually found on fresh water – were bobbing up and down on the waves, along with two truly marine ducks, an eider and a common scoter. A movement caught my eye. Close by, perched on a pile of rocks, was a plump, robin-sized bird with sooty plumage and a rusty-orange tail. A black redstart: a bird whose natural habitat is rocky hillsides, but which in Britain is often seen around industrial sites like this one. It bobbed up and down as it watched me warily with its beady, black eyes. \"Big days\" are always a challenge, especially in winter. With barely eight hours of daylight, there's always a compromise to be made: how many different locations should I visit to see the maximum possible number of species? I decided on eight sites within 20 miles of my home, and ended up with a respectable total of 77 species, although not quite the ones I had expected. I began in my garden at dawn, listening out for any songsters brave enough to join the winter chorus. Only a robin actually burst into song, but a few other birds revealed their presence by calling. As the sky gradually lightened, squadrons of rooks and jackdaws flew overhead, the rooks gathering by their nests in the tall ash trees at the end of our lane – the first sign of spring, perhaps. Then a real surprise: a flock of five goosanders, a scarce winter visitor, flying low overhead. My next stop, Cheddar reservoir, produced more ducks: a female smew and a pair of ruddy ducks among them. By the time I left, just before 10 o'clock, I had reached 45 species, and a quick stop at Tealham Moor brought this to 50. But I had begun to notice that I wasn't seeing many smaller birds, and that skylarks and meadow pipits – usually easy to see – were simply nowhere to be found. The coldest December on record had driven them to warmer climes, and during the day I managed to miss goldfinch, greenfinch, dunnock and song thrush as well. But many larger species were still around. So at Shapwick Heath I caught up with five Bewick's swans, all the way from Siberia, and a great white egret, once a rare visitor from eastern Europe, but now resident here in Somerset. And at the new RSPB reserve at Greylake, I enjoyed the splendid sight of a merlin shooting low towards me, in front of the hide. But the best moment of the day was still that momentary yet intimate encounter with the black redstart, perched against a backdrop of rocks, sea and a nuclear power station."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/14/jaopan-leader-redemption-naoto-kan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Japan's leader has been given a last chance for redemption | Masahiro Matsumura","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/jaopan-leader-redemption-naoto-kan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/jaopan-leader-redemption-naoto-kan","fields":{"headline":"Japan's leader has been given a last chance for redemption","bodyText":"News of the disaster hit the nation like a bolt from the blue. At first 11 March had been one of those ordinary days. The issues that concerned Japan were relatively mundane: the economic problems of deflation and unemployment, the inertia of a government unable to improve people's lives a year and a half after being voted in on rosy pledges. The country's politics were gridlocked; there was the familiar sense of things going wrong. Then the earthquake struck, devastating the northeastern coastal region of Japan's main island, Honshu, with an extraordinary toll of lives – possibly tens of thousands – and creating up to half a million refugees. The seismic energy overwhelmed all the precautions and measures Japan had put in place: all its experience, knowledge and technology was no match for this earthquake and tsunami. Little wonder that the government is more than willing to accept any help from rescue teams abroad. The whole nation is transfixed by the magnitude of the devastation inflicted on regions once noted for their beauty. People still cannot tear themselves away from TV news programmes broadcasting around the clock. Many are still trying to contact parents, children, friends, trying to make sure of their safety. Many are determined to volunteer for disaster relief work, to do whatever they can; others are starting to collect donations for victims. And yet, despite repeated TV images of the catastrophe, the nation of more than 120 million people still stands firm, with major metropolitan areas intact, including Tokyo and Osaka. Certainly, the greater Tokyo area is still experiencing significant electric power shortages; the spectre of a \"China syndrome\" hangs over us with the damage done to major nuclear power plants; and the economy is in turbulence, with the Nikkei diving. For all that, the difficulties are manageable, and cannot be compared with the annihilation suffered during the second world war. The nation is today equipped with the talent and the economic and industrial capabilities essential for reconstruction. Japan does not need any foreign economic aid because private-sector finance and individual savings remain large enough to finance reconstruction projects – although with deflation, a fiscal deficit and snowballing national debt, the government has to present viable policies to the financial markets. While this crisis will heighten a sense of unity and solidarity, our highly homogeneous nation will soon confront economic-policy issues sparked by the financing of gigantic reconstruction projects. The cost will probably reach some 50tn yen – 10% of Japan's GDP, and almost equal to the GDP decline triggered by the deflationary spiral following of 2008, which the Japanese economy has been trapped in ever since. Reconstruction could be just what is needed to jump-start the economy. Acting decisively has proved difficult for the government of Naoto Kan, the prime minister. At a time when most major economies are fighting inflation, Japan's is almost the only one that has been bogged down in deflation. This makes the Kan government more conservative than necessary; its actions may be too little, too late to drive reconstruction projects. Piecemeal public spending may be a platform for reconstruction per se, but it won't revitalise the national economy, nor the local economies of the devastated regions. Japan's biggest problem will be the old issue of the quality of the national leadership. The government has been driven into a corner by political donor and funding scandals, the mismanagement of the US-Japan alliance (centred on the relocation of a marine base in Okinawa) and, most recently, allegations about public pension programmes . The earthquake and tsunami may in fact prolong the life of the Kan government, at least for the next few months: the cabinet had been on the verge of resigning en masse, and the prime minister was almost forced to dissolve the lower house. Now, however, opposition parties will have to assist the Kan government in its disaster relief and reconstruction measures, with the spirit of a grand coalition. In the oriental tradition, a natural disaster is believed to be an omen, one that signals the disqualification of a ruler by heavenly mandate. The collective unconscious of the Japanese people is certainly aware of such an omen. To overcome this, the Kan government will have to excel in the coming crisis management, including getting the nuclear power plants under control. Until that outcome is clear, the world cannot know what the earthquake and tsunami means."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"theguardian/2011/may/16/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-15T23:05:15Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/may/16/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2011/may/16/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A report said that \"a brown puddle containing plutonium five times the legal safety limit leaked from an old ventilation duct at Sellafield nuclear complex in Cumbria\". Sellafield complained that this wrongly suggested it had breached a radiation safety limit for site workers or others. To clarify: the reading did not involve a legal dosage limit for people; rather, it was the threshold at which the operator must by law notify the Health and Safety Executive of the reading from such a leak; the HSE in turn reports this to ministers. \"In this case (plutonium), the reportable level is 1m becquerels,\" a Sellafield spokesman explained. \"The liquid, though small in volume, had a reading of just over 5m Bq.\" Had our piece actually been talking about a breach of the legal limit for nuclear industry employees exposed to ionising radiation, then that limit would have been 20 millisieverts per annum (Leaked nuclear report reveals three incidents at British plants, 21 April, page 13). On a different point: while the online version of this article was updated later on publication day to include responses from Sellafield and from EDF Energy – which owns several British nuclear power stations – these responses were lost when the piece was cut for space in the subsequent newspaper version. Regarding a leak of radioactivity at Torness, for instance, an EDF Energy spokeswoman had been quoted in the web version saying: \"One would have to drink one tonne of the fluid found to receive a dose equal to 30 minutes' flying time in an aeroplane\". • In a piece describing US President Barack Obama's recent visit to the World Trade Centre site in New York, this line appeared: \"...

Energy market reform, which the government is embarking on, is needed to create the right incentives to invest in renewable power generation and encourage a viable energy mix, according to Steve Holliday. \"This is a very important year – it will be pivotal,\" he told journalists on Monday said. \"We are seeing huge changes, and we urgently need to rejuvenate the UK's energy infrastructure. We need joined-up government and real commitment.\" For instance, he pointed to the current \"lack of coordination\" over a national strategy for offshore wind. At present, there is little attempt to coordinate how new offshore windfarms are connected to the National Grid, and plants are likely to be connected on an ad hoc basis. If there were a more coherent plan in place to reduce the number of connections needed, the cost of the connections would come down by about £3bn-£5bn in total, he estimated. That money could be spent instead on making the grid \"smarter\", he said, by installing new communications technology that would enable utilities to manage electricity demand by taking an element of control over household electrical appliances. Many of the UK's current fleet of power stations, including coal-fired and nuclear power plants, are coming to the end of their useful lives and must be replaced. This represents a unique opportunity to \"green\" the UK's power generation, Holliday will argue, but this will only happen if the government takes action to create the right conditions in the market. \"Greening the energy mix is an optional extra, but I believe it is affordable and it would generate jobs. Now is the time to be grasping this infrastructure opportunity.\" Holliday will also warn at tonight's Royal Academy of Engineering lecture that a serious shortage of skilled engineers is threatening the UK's ability to meet its climate change targets. A shortage of skilled staff may mean that UK employers must import talent from overseas in order to push through the transformation of the UK's energy infrastructure that is required in the next decade. \"We are importing skills, when there is a big opportunity to create the skills we need ourselves,\" he said. Holliday will predict that the UK will need to increase its installed capacity of electricity generation from 75GW today to 100GW by 2030, in order to meet the rapidly rising demand for electricity that will result from the move to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport and heating - switching vehicles from petrol to electric, and to use electricity for heating rather than gas. One of the results will be an even greater reliance on imports of foreign gas, a fuel in which the UK was until recently self-sufficient. But gas will be used for electricity generation in a different way, he predicts. At present, gas-fired power is used as the backbone of electricity generation. In future, it will be needed as a back-up for the massive expansion of offshore wind, because gas-fired power stations can be turned on and off very quickly, unlike alternatives such as nuclear plants. Holliday also envisages a growing role for nuclear power, with new plants coming on stream as the current power stations are gradually retired. He urged the government to press ahead with its plans to support pilot projects demonstrating carbon capture and storage technology, which he said represented a \"unique opportunity\" for the UK to develop \"exportable expertise\". Holliday also dismissed fears that the UK's electricity grid could be vulnerable to solar storms, as the Sun's activity reaches a new maximum after years of quietude. He said National Grid had done a great deal of work on the phenomenon, and concluded there was little to fear. \"We do not believe this poses a huge risk to the system,\" he said. But he did warn that cyber attacks could pose a more serious problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-venezuela-chavez-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-09T13:13:19Z","webTitle":"WikiLeaks cables dismiss Hugo Chávez's nuclear ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-venezuela-chavez-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-venezuela-chavez-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"WikiLeaks cables dismiss Hugo Chávez's nuclear ambitions","bodyText":"The US has privately scorned Hugo Chávez's nuclear ambitions as empty bluster despite Venezuela's energy deals with Iran and Russia. US diplomats in Caracas played down the socialist leader's plans to build nuclear reactors, saying the government was too shambolic and cash-strapped. A confidential cable from John Caulfield, the deputy chief of mission, said Washington had little reason to fear Venezuelan plans to exploit uranium with Iranian help and build a reactor with Russian help. \"Although rumours that Venezuela is providing Iran with Venezuelan-produced uranium may help burnish the government's revolutionary credentials, there seems to be little basis in reality to the claims,\" said the 2009 cable. A well-placed Venezuelan nuclear research scientist told Caulfield the government did not trust scientists, and that supposedly hi-tech laboratories lacked nitrogen and had broken equipment. He called Venezuela's nuclear deals \"political theatre\". Caulfield said that at one point Venezuela may have been able to make good on Chávez's promise to purchase multi-billion dollar nuclear power plants from Russia. \"But even that ... is doubtful due to the Venezuelan government's current financial difficulties.\" US diplomats in Bolivia played down the prospect of Venezuela providing nuclear materials to allies. \"Similar to the conclusions drawn by La Paz ... it is highly unlikely that Venezuela is providing Venezuelan uranium to third countries,\" Caulfield said. Chávez has abjured interest in nuclear weapons but his oft-cited plans for nuclear energy co-operation with Moscow and Tehran alarmed US hawks such as John Bolton, a former ambassador to the UN. On a visit to Moscow last month Venezuela's leader signed a deal with the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, for a nuclear reactor to be built over the next 10-15 years. Its cost and location were not revealed, presumably keeping US scepticism intact. The US state department's official position is that it is aware of Venezuela's nuclear power intentions and is watching \"very closely\" to ensure compliance with international agreements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/27/scientists-answer-toughest-energy-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-27T11:01:10Z","webTitle":"Top scientists answer your 'toughest' energy questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/scientists-answer-toughest-energy-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/27/scientists-answer-toughest-energy-questions","fields":{"headline":"Top scientists answer your 'toughest' energy questions","bodyText":"Can the world shift entirely from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind, solar and marine power?

The cows had been fed on rice straw containing high levels of the radioactive isotope that was harvested after the 11 March tsunami triggered a core meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. While officials said consuming the meat did not present an immediate threat to health, the incident has highlighted concerns over food safety in the wake of the crisis, which has caused contamination in milk, tea, leaf vegetables, fish and water. The government is expected to announce the suspension of cattle shipments from Fukushima, and possibly other areas nearby, on Tuesday. \"The most likely outcome is that we will ban beef shipments,\" Goshi Hosono, a special adviser to the prime minister on the nuclear clean-up, said on a TV programme. \"We are discussing the matter along these lines. We have to ensure food safety.\" Authorities in the prefecture confirmed that 84 head of cattle from five affected farms had been shipped to eight locations, including Tokyo and Osaka, between late March and mid-July. Local media reported that the contamination risk could be more widespread, affecting farms 60 miles from the power plant. Kyodo news agency said it had calculated that as many as 143 cows sent to all but 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures may have been exposed to radiation via feed. \"We may need to increase our response by checking the distribution of contaminated straw,\" said Kohei Otsuka, the senior vice-minister for health. \"We are currently considering Fukushima prefecture, but we may have to consider the need for a further response by checking the distribution of contaminated straw.\" Retailers said it was highly likely that some of the contaminated beef had already been eaten. On Sunday, the Aeon chain of supermarkets said 319kg (703lb) of beef from a farm in Asakawa in Fukushima, had been sold at 14 of its stores in Tokyo and the surrounding area between late April and the middle of last month. Tests on straw at a farm in Koriyama city in Fukushima prefecture showed caesium levels as high as 500,000 becquerels per kg. Those readings are about 378 times the legal limit set by the government. Farmers in the area said they had not been told about a government warning, issued days after the nuclear accident, not to give their animals feed that had been stored outside. The Tokyo metropolitan government said on Sunday that high levels of radioactive caesium were detected in meat from a cow shipped to a packing plant in Tokyo from a farm in Koriyama. The meat contained radioactive cesium at measurements as high as 2,400 becquerels per kg, nearly five times the government-set safety limit of 500 becquerels per kg. Efforts to track down exposed cattle began earlier this month after meat from cows at a farm in Minamisoma, about 15 miles from Fukushima Daiichi, were found to have been fed with contaminated straw. Authorities in Tokyo said they had detected radiation levels in beef originating from the farm of up to 2,300 becquerels per kg. Government officials and some experts played down the risk to health. \"This is not a number that would clearly cause abnormal effects on health even if the beef was eaten,\" Ikuro Anzai, honorary professor of radiation protection at Ritsumeikan University, told Kyodo. But he added: \"It would be better to refrain from eating it until the situation becomes clear.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/sep/16/glasgow-favourite-location-hollywood-filmmakers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-16T17:27:18Z","webTitle":"Glasgow: the unlikely favourite location for Hollywood film-makers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/16/glasgow-favourite-location-hollywood-filmmakers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/sep/16/glasgow-favourite-location-hollywood-filmmakers","fields":{"headline":"Glasgow: the unlikely favourite location for Hollywood film-makers","bodyText":"Glasgow in the chill air of autumn may not be your idea of a dead ringer for northern California. But the makers of Cloud Atlas, the film adaptation of David Mitchell's 2004 novel, disagree. This weekend film crews begin shooting San Francisco-set scenes in the city with Oscar-winner Halle Berry; the film also stars Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon and Ben Whishaw, and is co-directed by the Matrix trilogy's Wachowski brothers and German filmmaker Tom Tykwer. It is only weeks since Glasgow was the location for another high-profile shoot, as scenes from World War Z, a zombie film starring Brad Pitt, were shot around the city's grandiose George Square, doubling as Philadelphia. Unlikely as it may seem, Glasgow appears to have become the latest favourite location for Hollywood producers. Just north of the city centre runs Douglas Street, its stomach-churning downhill descent from the heights of Blythswood Hill briefly interrupted by crossroads terraced out of the hillside. Partway down, it becomes the Cloud Atlas film set, renamed, with a characteristically San Franciscan green road sign, Spring Street. An elaborate graffiti mural has been created, which seems to hint at some of the other stories in Mitchell's Russian-doll sequence of six narratives, which forge through time from the 1860s to the post-apocalyptic future. A 1970s Lincoln Continental Mark IV is parked up at an angle in the middle of the road. Everything is primed and ready to tell the story of Berry's Luisa Rey, a 1970s investigative journalist working on a story of corruption at a nuclear power plant. In fact, it is easy to see how these streets can stand in for San Francisco the layout's \"decidedly San Franciscan effects\" are even noted in Andrew Gomme and David Waller's book, Architecture of Glasgow. According to Grant Hill, Cloud Atlas's co-producer: \"While it wouldn't necessarily be a natural imperative [that Glasgow could become the northern coast of California] actually it has some very good examples of the architecture we needed. And then, all important is the willingness of the city authorities to co-operate. Hard though it is to believe, it's difficult to find straight, centre-city streets that can been closed off.\" According to Hill, word-of-mouth on the co-operative attitude of the council to the World War Z team helped. \"Once a film goes somewhere and has a good experience, word gets around.\" But are such events good for the city? Pitt's appearance in Glasgow caused great excitement, with crowds gathering in Glasgow Central station to get a glimpse of the actor and his partner, actor Angelina Jolie, as they disembarked from their specially chartered train from London, and around the set itself. Some enthusiasts even enrolled into \"zombie school\" to become one of a 100 or so local extras. It was, according to Creative Scotland's locations manager Belle Doyle, \"almost a carnival atmosphere\". Not everyone was so positive, though: taxi drivers complained of having endured traffic disruption; commuters who usually had 20-minute daily journeys found they had expanded into hour-long treks. As one local writer said: \"It's a bit depressing. We used to be a city that made things, and exported them. Now we are a raddled old drag queen, dressing up in someone else's clothes.\" In a post-industrial age, however, the city's growing role as a Hollywood star is seen to make good economic sense. Gordon Matheson, leader of the council, points to an estimated extra £150m poured into the local economy by filmmaking in the city over the past decade. But according to Doyle it's not just about economic benefit: \"It's also about supporting our local skills, our local crews – and in that way, we also support indigenous film production.\" Over the past 30 years, the City Chambers, an elaborately Italianate building with mosaic floors and marble staircases, has done service – with an irony perhaps not lost on Glaswegians – as both the Kremlin (An Englishman Abroad) and the Vatican (Heavenly Pursuits). Terence Davies's The House of Mirth made Kelvingrove Art Gallery into New York's Grand Central Station. There is even, points out Dr Jonathan Murray, lecturer in film studies at Edinburgh College of Art, a Jet Li vehicle called Unleashed, \"which features the bizarre spectacle of Morgan Freeman doing his weekly shop in a Glaswegian branch of Spar\". Matheson also believes that Glasgow's Hollywood role has a positive impact on tourism; though, as Murray points out, in reality the most powerful image of Glasgow in film is quite different from these elegant Hollywood shoots, in which the city appears in heavy disguise. Think of Glasgow in cinema and one is more likely to think of uncompromising, sometimes grim indies: Lynne Ramsay's Ratcatcher, Andrea Arnold's Red Road, Ken Loach's My Name Is Joe or the recent Neds, by Peter Mullan. Broadly, the image of the city projected by this kind of film is, says Murray, \"hypermasculine, and somewhere on the tightrope between workless and working class … an image that the city authorities would prefer to dispel\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2011/apr/24/nuclear-waste-storage","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-24T20:31:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear waste: Keep out – for 100,000 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/24/nuclear-waste-storage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/24/nuclear-waste-storage","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear waste: Keep out – for 100,000 years","bodyText":"Ceremonies will be held around the world on Tuesday to mark the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster but, in truth, Chernobyl is one event we’re in no danger of forgetting. For one thing, the earthquake in Japan has given the world a second Level Seven incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale, refreshing public fears with almost cosmic timing. For another, the legacy of Chernobyl will be remembered for much, much longer than anyone would wish. According to estimates, this area of northern Ukraine will be uninhabitable for decades, if not centuries. We like to think of our architectural treasures as milestones of human progress. The Egyptian pyramids, say, or the Eiffel Tower. Perhaps we imagine a Planet of the Apes-like scenario where our ruined monuments will stand as testament to our civilisation long after we’re gone. But what will most probably outlive anything else we have ever built will be our nuclear legacy. Whatever its pros and cons as an energy source, one thing that’s non-negotiable about nuclear power is the construction it necessitates. Less than a century after we first split the atom, we’re now coming to appreciate the vast technological, engineering, financial and political resources nuclear technology demands. In terms of scale, complexity and longevity, much of this stuff makes Dubai’s Burj Khalifa look like a sandcastle. It is too early to know what will be done about Fukushima. A 20km exclusion zone has been imposed and radiation levels will not be brought down to safe levels for at least another six months. Even at Chernobyl, the 1986 accident is by no means dealt with. Immediately afterwards, the Soviets hastily cobbled together the most effective structure they could to contain further radioactive contamination. Unromantically named the Object Shelter, it was a concrete and steel sarcophagus resting on the remains of the ruined reactor. Owing to the high levels of radioactivity, it had been impossible to bolt or weld the Object Shelter together, so within a decade it was on the verge of collapse. Given that 95% of reactor four’s nuclear materials are still inside, another nuclear disaster remains a possibility. Hence the current longer-term plan, called the New Safe Confinement. This €1.6bn (£1.4bn) project calls for the erection of an arch-shaped hangar, bigger than a football pitch and high enough to fit the Statue of Liberty inside. Because of the radiation levels, it must be built 500 metres away then slid over the top of the reactor and the Object Shelter. At 32,000 tonnes, it is just about the heaviest object ever moved. “In some ways, this is how the engineers of the pyramids must have felt,” says Eric Schmieman, chief technical adviser on the New Safe Confinement. “The steel structure has a design life of 100 years, so there are very rigorous requirements to demonstrate all the materials will last that long. The Eiffel Tower has been around that long but it’s been protected from corrosion by painting. You can’t repaint this because of the radiation.” The structure of the New Safe Confinement is carbon steel, protected by inner and outer layers of stainless steel cladding. Its purpose is not to shield radioactive emissions but to prevent the release of radioactive dust and other materials, and to keep out rainwater, which could carry contaminants into the water table. Work is currently proceeding on the foundations, and the arch will be assembled and slid into place by 2015. Then huge, remote-controlled cranes inside will dismantle the Object Shelter and begin retrieving the hazardous materials inside. The structure will be visible from space, a hulking shell of steel in the midst of a landscape of industrial devastation. By the time it reaches the end of its 100-year life span, it is hoped that all the radioactive material will have been removed, but then comes the problem of where to put it. At the beginning of the nuclear era, the emphasis was very much on the power stations, including Basil Spence’s heroic 1950s design for Trawsfynydd, in Snowdonia. But very little consideration was given to what came after. Those early power stations became obsolete: Trawsfynydd was decommissioned in 1991. What’s more, the industry has so far generated nearly 300,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, and counting. To be safe, it must be isolated from all living organisms for at least 100,000 years. Current opinion is that the best thing to do with nuclear waste is put it underground in what is known as a “deep geological repository”. At present, there are no such repositories in operation anywhere. In Britain, all the nuclear waste produced since the 1940s is stored above ground in Sellafield. Preliminary moves have been made towards finding a site in Cumbria but there’s a powerful local resistance to such schemes, and no long-term solution is expected before 2040. In the US, a site was earmarked decades ago at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, 100 miles from Las Vegas, but the Obama administration finally abandoned the scheme last year. Some countries are further ahead, though. Sweden’s nuclear operation presents itself as a model for the rest of the world, and shows how much effort a fully joined-up operation requires. After cooling on site for a year, spent fuel from Sweden’s three coastal nuclear sites is transported in purpose-built casks, on a specially designed ship, to a central interim storage facility. There, robotic arms transfer the fuel into storage cassettes underwater. These cassettes are then sent to another storage pool 25 metres beneath the facility to cool for at least another 30 years. Then the waste is moved to another plant to seal in copper canisters before it arrives at its final resting place in the geological repository. Sweden has numerous other nuclear facilities, including the Äspö hard rock laboratory, an underground research laboratory open to visitors. Bizarrely, Äspö’s surface buildings could be mistaken for a traditional farmstead: a collection of buildings in red and white timber. The folksy tweeness only points up how alien the rest of the nuclear landscape is. This is the heaviest of heavy industries, and it is often the least visible: a hidden parallel realm of anonymous industrial facilities, restricted zones, clinical chambers and subterranean vaults. Sweden has identified a site for its deep geological repository, in Forsmark, but the Finns have been building theirs since 2004. Situated on the northwest coast, a few miles from its Olkiluoto nuclear power stations, it consists of a 5km-long tunnel spiralling 400m down to the bedrock, where a honeycomb of storage vaults fans out. Named Onkalo, whose literal translation is “cavity”, it was the subject of a documentary last year, Into Eternity. Retitled Nuclear Eternity and broadcast on More4 tomorrow, the film fully appreciates the Kubrickian visual aspects of the nuclear landscape and the staggering challenges the project presents to our notions of permanence, history – even time itself. Onkalo will be ready to take waste in 2020, and then will be finally sealed in 2120, after which it will not be opened for 100,000 years. By that time, Finland will probably have been through another ice age. Little trace of our current civilisation will remain. The prospect of designing anything to last even 200 years is unlikely for most architects; the Egyptian pyramids are “only” about 5,000 years old. Plan like an Egyptian This longevity poses Onkalo’s custodians, and others in their position, with another unprecedented design issue: what sign should you put on the door? As one expert says in Into Eternity, the message is simple: “This is not an important place; it is a place of danger. Stay away from the site. Do not disturb the site.” But how to communicate with people so far in the future? Put up a sign in a language they don’t understand and they are sure to open it just to see what’s inside. Ancient Egyptians on the pyramid planning committee probably grappled with the same issues. One of the Finns suggests using an image of Munch’s The Scream; another suggests a series of monoliths with pictographs and an underground library explaining the tunnel; another wonders if it is better not to tell anyone Onkalo is there at all. When a team pondered the same issue in the US in the 1990s, they came up with proposals for environments that communicated threat and hostility. They imagined landscapes of giant, spiky, black thorns or menacing, jagged earthworks, or vast concrete blocks creating narrow streets that lead nowhere. If architecture is about designing spaces for human habitation, this is practically its opposite. These subterranean cities are places no human will ever inhabit or see, places designed to repel life and light. They are a mirror image to our towering achievements above ground and, like the pyramids, they are both monument and tomb. Every nuclear nation is compelled to build them, at great effort and expense, and to continue building them until we find a better way to deal with nuclear waste or a better alternative to nuclear power. Until then, we must live with the thought that in some unimaginable future aeons hence, this could be all that remains to prove our species was ever here. • This article was amended on 25 April 2011, to correct the translation of the word onkalo. The original article gave its meaning as “hiding place”.

Friends of the Earth is calling on MPs to block the government's prime energy policy statement, which comes before parliament on Monday amid a deluge of new planning applications or consents. Some plans are already queuing up in the public planning system. Scottish Power wants to construct a 1.2GW station at Avonmouth, near Bristol, while RWE npower is building a 2GW gas plant at Pembroke, south Wales, and a 2.4GW station at Willington in Derbyshire. It is also looking at a smaller facility at Fawley, near Southampton. Smaller schemes include ones by Welsh Power, which wants to construct an 850MW plant at Fleetwood in Lancashire, and Trafford Peaking Power is developing one in Manchester. The Guardian has unearthed as many as 30 potential gas schemes , which are either in late development stage or very early proposals, and which – if built could lock Britain into a higher carbon future at a time when it is trying to promote renewable power to cut emissions. Simon Bullock, a campaigner with FoE, says the national policy statement which will be debated in the Commons today would allow gas projects to be fast-forwarded on the basis that the UK has an \"urgent\" need for all new capacity to replace old nuclear and coal plants. \"Instead of there being an 'urgent' need for new gas, there is in fact no need for new gas – beyond the capacity already being built or with planning permission. The new capacity the government says is needed by 2025 is already either under construction or has planning permission,\" he argues. London-based consultancy, New Power, argued regulatory and financial uncertainty had slowed a dash for gas but it still believed \"interest in new gas-fired plants remains high\". Gas is seen as attractive by developers because plants are relatively cheap and quick to construct but consumer groups are worried about soaring gas prices. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman voting through the national policy statements were a vital part of the move to set Britain on a new course and rebuild out-of-date infrastructure. \"The transition to low carbon energy can't just happen overnight. Gas in particular will be needed to provide vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply,\" he explained. \"In the long term there is likely to be a role for gas plant equipped with carbon capture and storage, which is why new gas plants are required to be built carbon capture ready and the carbon capture and storage demonstration competition is open to gas plant as well as coal plant.\" RWE npower, which The Guardian calculates could have nearly 9GW of gas-fired plants in action by 2020 and which revealed last week it was in wide-ranging talks with Gazprom of Russia, insists it has made no decisions on facilities such as Willington or Fawley. A spokesman said: \"I would not say this a dash for gas as we are progressing renewable and other projects but we do believe in diversity because the future of energy is uncertain.\" RWE said talks with Gazprom were at a very early stage but it admitted it could include an equity stake being released to the Russians and combined gas projects in the UK. Gazprom was at one stage linkled with the potential purchase of British Gas, something that caused political concern among some MPs. RWE is also among the companies looking at building nuclear power plants but said there was no question of Gazprom being involved in those schemes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/nov/22/is-angela-merkel-europes-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-22T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel: Europe's saviour – or biggest problem?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/22/is-angela-merkel-europes-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/nov/22/is-angela-merkel-europes-problem","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel: Europe's saviour – or biggest problem?","bodyText":"On 22 December 1999, a letter appeared on the front page of Germany's leading conservative daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. It contained a searing attack on the country's most highly regarded statesman, Helmut Kohl, recently retired chancellor and much-feted architect of reunification. Kohl, then mired in an ugly party funding scandal, had to be cut loose, the letter urged, as teenagers must jettison their parents to grow into adults. The only way forward for his Christian Democrats was a complete break with their past. It was a remarkable letter, a clinical and very public coup-de-grace delivered to an eminent, mortally wounded elder. What made it more remarkable was that the person who signed it was not one of the obviously thrusting young pretenders to Kohl's CDU throne, but a moon-faced and oddly unmemorable protege whom he used to refer to, dismissively, as das Mädchen: the girl. Some like to see in this episode – which duly launched Angela Merkel on the stratospheric trajectory that would see her elected head of the centre-right CDU the following year and Germany's first woman chancellor barely five years after that – proof positive that she is a sharp, maybe even a ruthless opportunist, eminently capable of bold, decisive and, if necessary, dirty deeds to achieve her ends. Others construe it more as an uncharacteristic moment of madness from a politician who otherwise has constructed an entire career on caution and consensus; a public figure so superficially unremarkable, so singularly lacking in passion or charisma that in nearly 25 years in politics she has (as her biographer puts it) \"not made a single speech that stayed in the memory\". A moderator, not a leader; a tactician, not a strategist. She could, of course, be both. But what's becoming increasingly clear, as the euro teeters on the precipice and economic disaster beckons, is that if she is, a great many people – most of them, it has to be said, outside Germany – would actually quite like to see a bit more of the former, and rather less of the latter. A touch more of the bold and decisive, somewhat less of the calm and methodical. If possible. Merkel is, after all, about the most important person in the world right now. As leader of the eurozone's undisputed economic powerhouse, she in effect holds the future financial wellbeing of all of us in her hands. And the worry is she's not up to the job. For all her undoubted qualities and undimmed domestic popularity (the pollsters, certainly, see no hint of a rival who could threaten her re-election in 2013, for a third successive term), Merkel – a pale, irredeemably frumpy, maddeningly hard-to-pin-down shadow of an Adenauer, a Brandt, a Kohl – is totally not what's needed, say her critics. Some are downright damning. \"Since the very beginning of this crisis, in 2007-8, Angela Merkel has not ceased providing us with the proof that she is really not the stuff of which great leaders are made,\" says Jean Quatremer, longstanding Brussels correspondent of the French daily Libération and a veteran observer of European affairs. \"She's navigating by sight, with no real political vision, and no authority. So much sluggishness, so much incapacity to grasp the gravity of the situation, takes the breath away ... Angela Merkel has now become Europe's principal problem.\" Others are not quite as scathing, but no less despondent. Merkel's greatest failing, says Charles Grant, of the pro-European thinktank Centre for European Reform, is that she's either unwilling or unable to question prevailing German orthodoxies. \"Truly great political leaders, real statesmen – they can change the weather,\" Grant says. \"They're prepared to think the unthinkable, to say and do things that they know will be deeply unpopular. Merkel just isn't naturally quite brave enough to do a Thatcher, even a Sarkozy, and try to actually change the way people think.\" There's certainly little in the chancellor's background to cast her as a fearless challenger of the status quo. Born in July 1954 in Hamburg, she was only a few months old when her father, Horst Kasner, a dauntingly dedicated Lutheran pastor, and his wife moved to the parish of Templin in east Germany, not far from Berlin, where Kasner helped train other priests. The church was also next door to a centre for handicapped children that took up much of his attention. Occasional visits back to the west gave Angela and her younger brother and sister a glimpse of life the other side of the Iron Curtain. But unlike many of her contemporaries, she never got itchy feet: perhaps uneasy at having a pastor for a father in an unambiguously atheist state, Merkel positively threw herself into the system. She was a star student, at one point winning a trip to Moscow as a reward for her mastery of Russian. At the same time, she was a keen member of the socialist Free German Youth, or FDJ, organising expeditions and excursions and even, according to some, helping with publicity and propaganda. After school, it was on to Leipzig university to study physics, and eventually the East German Academy of Sciences in Berlin, as a research physicist. On the home front, a 1977 marriage to Ulrich Merkel, a fellow student, ended after five years, and on moving to Berlin she met and eventually married a quantum chemist at Humboldt university, Joachim Sauer. Sauer stays well out of his wife's spotlight, although he will, gamely, escort the leaders' wives when Germany hosts international summits. For her part, Merkel, who never had children, claims still to do her bit domestically – the odd spot of shopping, sewing and cake-baking. There's plenty in those early years, plainly, for cod psychologists to chew on. A distant, otherwise-engaged father whom she felt she could never sufficiently satisfy; a religious upbringing that valued hard work (everyone who knows her cites Merkel's prodigious appetite for that) and abhorred showiness; an academic discipline that rewards calm, methodical analysis rather than bravura out-of-the-box leaps of faith. Equally, many have remarked on the ease with which Merkel navigated the murky waters of pre-reunification East German academe. That she succeeded in pursuing a successful scientific career without ever having to join the Communist party as an adult reveals, it is said, a rare ability to keep a low profile, make oneself unthreatening, negotiate awkward compromises. At 35, she came late to politics, eventually getting involved through the burgeoning democracy movement shortly before the Wall came down in 1989. Showing impeccable timing and considerable political nous, she joined the CDU weeks before reunification. To Chancellor Kohl, she was a gift: an Ossi (former East German), a conservative, and a woman to boot. Three months later, Merkel found herself minister for woman and youth in his first post-reunification cabinet. Merkel is a CDU oddity: a Protestant from the east, she heads a party whose core vote is Catholic and whose political roots are solidly in the west. Policy-wise, too, she's something of an enigma. Her hobbyhorses are climate change and Germany's ageing and shrinking population. But her socialist predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, pushed through the painful reforms that have allowed Germany to flourish today, and in her first term as chancellor her moderate, social-market conservatism was straitjacketed in a coalition with Schröder's SPD. She has taken decisions to end conscription and, in the wake of Fukushima, to scrap nuclear power. But her second term, in a coalition with the liberal and increasingly unpopular Free Democratic party, has been largely dominated by the fallout from the global financial and economic crisis. Her response to this at home has been criticised as messy and hesitant, but it's hard to argue it did Germany's economy any actual harm. But for most Germans, policies are not the point of Merkel. For them, what they know about her character far outweighs what they don't know about her ideas. Polls have for some time now showed her to be more popular than her party; that cautious, sensible, pragmatic style – her biographer, Gerd Langguth, has said she likes to \"sit problems out\", and rather than entertain grand ideas of a \"historical mission\" or \"social vision\" seeks \"to solve today's problems, in a way that ensures she stays in power\" – clearly resonates. A large majority plainly like the image of Germany that Merkel projects. And that, when it comes to the current eurozone crisis, may be the nub of the problem. Foreign critics may like to see Merkel as devoid of imagination; for Germans, she's level-headed. We portray her as dithering; in Germany, she brings to the summit table a much-needed dose of calm and reflection. A poll two weeks ago for the state broadcaster ARD found her personal approval rating had risen by nine points since October, to 57%. And she's not about to do anything that might upset that. There's an ideological gulf, too, on the key question of economics. It doesn't help, concedes a German banker in Frankfurt who would rather not be identified, that few Germans, hardly anyone in the German government, and certainly none of Merkel's economic advisers \"have ever read Keynes, or even begin to get market economics. To some extent, they're entitled not to, of course: they have the most successful economy in Europe. The trouble is, this thing is a hell of a lot bigger than Germany.\" So it remains the Bundesbank's, Merkel's and Germany's deeply held conviction that discipline and austerity are the only ways out of the current crisis, and that any more generous solutions – collective Eurobonds, for example, or allowing the European Central Bank to act as a lender of last resort, both ideas touted in London and several other capitals – will only encourage more profligacy in Europe's irresponsible southern periphery. \"Her advisers are absolutely convinced they're right,\" says Grant, \"and they won't take lessons from Anglo-Saxons. But there's a real danger that Merkel, neither an intellectual nor an economist, will go down as the woman who destroyed the euro because of this lack of boldness, this inability to challenge the intellectual climate in which she operates.\" Moreover, many Germans believe the euro has become a kind of unfair and prohibitively expensive tax on their economic prowess. (It has also, of course, contributed greatly to their wellbeing, allowing the mighty German export machine to produce goods far more affordable in those ailing southern economies than they ever would have in Deutschmarks. But there's little political capital to be made from explaining that, and only very recently has Merkel started to make the effort. Grant confesses he has changed his mind on Merkel: \"In the beginning, I was a fan. She was brilliant at the early summits; brought everyone together, acted as peacemaker, got deals done. But since the eurozone crisis ... she's pandered to opinion. The very first Greek bailout, back in 2010, was delayed by months because of an election in North Rhine-Westphalia, which the CDU lost anyway.\" (Away from the crisis, he detects a similar pattern: \"On nuclear power, she did what she did because she faced tricky elections, especially in Baden-Wurtemburg. She's a follower, not a leader.\") In Brussels, Quatremer agrees: \"She's no doubt a good captain when the weather is calm. But as soon as the seas get rough, she's incapable. I would seriously doubt, for example, whether this chancellor would have been capable of persuading her citizens to accept the euro, as Kohl did in his day, in the face of overwhelmingly hostile public opinion.\" Constanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow with the German Marshall Fund in Berlin and former political editor of the Hamburg weekly paper Die Zeit, reckons at least one part of all this Merkel-bashing is simply misplaced. It's true, she says, that the chancellor's most striking characteristic is \"her staying power. She's just still there. Like Thatcher, except Maggie was thrilling and terrifying and Merkel is neither. Like water drilling through granite.\" Stelzenmüller also agrees that Merkel \"leads from behind. She's undeniably a master tactician, always there at the finishing line ... but she favours strategic ambiguity. She'd doubtless say people like Blair and Obama are fools for saying out loud and up front what they're going to do, then failing to do it.\" But like all German leaders, Stelzenmüller stresses, Merkel is severely constrained by the country's political structure, its Länder, coalition government, and a powerful constitutional court: \"Few leaders are as responsive to public mood as Merkel, because none sail so close to the wind.\" Robin Niblett, director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, better known as Chatham House, readily concedes the point. \"Being chancellor has some of the aspects of being US president,\" he notes. \"You're simply not as in charge as people think you are. Cameron and Sarkozy, for example, have immeasurably more concentrated power than Merkel does.\" But he too sees something deeper, more fundamental in the German leader's makeup: \"She's highly methodical and thorough, yes. And she doesn't want to be rushed. But but she's not, like some, methodical and thorough enough to then go on and be bold. In the end, Merkel will always be cautious.\" What the German chancellor seeks, Niblett reckons, is \"an equilibrium. And when she's found it, she wants to keep it. That's her guiding principle. It strikes me there's almost a sense of insecurity about where Germany sits, psychologically, as a country. And she's just very worried indeed about fracturing it.\" That patient, logical, methodical approach has sometimes appeared to pay off: forcing Greece, for example, to pledge more structural reforms, and winning a voluntary agreement from the banks to take a 50% haircut on Greek debt. And Merkel has been able to overcome her innate distaste for Nicolas Sarkozy (the French president is all she detests in a man, and in a leader: brash, flamboyant, impetuous, brimming with big but random ideas), to build a functioning relationship. But she may also have stored up trouble for herself by ruling out potential exit strategies, and by cosseting German voters, refraining for so long from telling them the truth: that Germany has not only profited from the euro, but helped cause its problems – German banks, after all, lent to Greeks, who used the money to buy German products. Ultimately, Niblett concludes, \"the worry has to be that she may be right in theory, but wrong in practice. That this crisis may turn out to be just so big and irrational that maybe a country like France, bolder, more mercurial, may have a better nose for it. The bottom line is, Merkel's style of leadership is simply not suited to the role the world needs Germany to play in the current crisis.\" Unfortunately, that style of leadership is very much the one that Germany, in times of need, wants most. \"Germans don't want ideological posturing or undue stridency or big, dramatic gestures,\" says the Frankfurt banker. \"They want a sensible, pragmatic leader who will truly represent Germany and not betray core German values, the things that matter most here: hard work, fiscal responsibility, the social market economy. For the moment, that's what we've got. And we're very happy with it, thank you.\" • This article was amended on 23 November 2011 because the original incorrectly said Angela Merkel was born in 1945."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/sep/21/huhne-green-jobs-economy-boost","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-21T19:57:11Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne announces 250,000 green jobs to boost the economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/21/huhne-green-jobs-economy-boost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/sep/21/huhne-green-jobs-economy-boost","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne announces 250,000 green jobs to boost the economy","bodyText":"A plan to create almost 250,000 jobs in green industries, including nuclear power and home insulation, will turbo-charge the economy and help offset budget cuts, the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, claimed today. The \"green deal\" will lead to thousands of workers modernising some 26 million homes to make them more energy efficient as part of the coalition's ambition to be the \"greenest government ever\". Setting out the plan, Huhne said: \"Since there is no money left, my department is pioneering new ways of turning this government into the greenest ever. \"We use more energy to heat our homes than Sweden, where it's seven degrees colder in January. We might as well be standing outside burning £50 notes. By stopping this waste, we can make big savings on bills, and use them to pay businesses for the cost of insulation. This is the green deal.\" Huhne was unable to give any news on whether there will be public funds for the proposed green investment bank or whether the Treasury will provide any start-up funds for up to four pioneering carbon capture and storage plants. There is an interval of a couple of years in which the Treasury would need to subsidise the projects before an industry levy could fund the plants. Negotiations with the Treasury are continuing, and Liberal Democrat sources said there was no guarantee that there would be an announcement by the time of the spending review on 20 October. In his set piece conference speech, Huhne pledged that by the end of the parliament Britain would boast the fastest growing renewable industry in the EU. He also promised that he would require energy firms to tell consumers before they raise prices. He said: \"In any other business consumers know the price before they buy. Energy should be no different.\" Huhne will use an energy bill this autumn to require consumers to be informed on their bill what they going to pay at current consumption levels on their existing tariff or an alternative tariff. He risked some controversy by making it clear he will go ahead with nuclear power stations so long as there is no hidden public subsidy. He does not regard a carbon floor price as a subsidy to nuclear power since it will be available to other industries, including renewables. Huhne told Lib Dem members that if they expected the chancellor, George Osborne, to support taking more low-paid earners out of the tax system, they had to respond. \"George Osborne expects me to deliver our agreement on nuclear power, which is that there is an important place for new nuclear stations in our energy mix as long as there is no public subsidy. A deal is a deal, and I will deliver,\" he said. He argued there is no need for subsidy since nuclear power is \"now a mature technology, not an infant needing nurture\". He said, \"I am fed up with the stand-off between renewables and nuclear which means we have neither – we will have both. We will have low-carbon energy and security of supply\". Liberal Democrats MPs in the coalition agreement have a right to abstain for the new nuclear power stations in line with party policy, he said. Huhne has not yet said whether he will personally abstain He also announced a new \"government-wide carbon plan\" setting out policies and deadlines for each department to \"ensure real action on climate change\". Audrey Gallacher, head of energy policy at the watchdog Consumer Focus, said: \"Getting energy suppliers to give consumers more warning of price rises is something we've called on Ofgem to do – and this announcement is a step in the right direction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/01/fukushima-chernobyl-risks-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear's green cheerleaders forget Chernobyl at our peril | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/01/fukushima-chernobyl-risks-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/01/fukushima-chernobyl-risks-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear's green cheerleaders forget Chernobyl at our peril","bodyText":"Every day there are more setbacks to solving the Japanese nuclear crisis and it's pretty clear that the industry and governments are telling us little; have no idea how long it will take to control; or what the real risk of cumulative contamination may be. The authorities reassure us by saying there is no immediate danger and a few absolutist environmentalists obsessed with nuclear power because of the urgency to limit emissions repeat the industry mantra that only a few people died at Chernobyl – the worst nuclear accident in history. Those who disagree are smeared and put in the same camp as climate change deniers. I prefer the words of Alexey Yablokov, member of the Russian academy of sciences, and adviser to President Gorbachev at the time of Chernobyl: \"When you hear 'no immediate danger' [from nuclear radiation] then you should run away as far and as fast as you can.\" Five years ago I visited the still highly contaminated areas of Ukraine and the Belarus border where much of the radioactive plume from Chernobyl descended on 26 April 1986. I challenge chief scientist John Beddington and environmentalists like George Monbiot or any of the pundits now downplaying the risks of radiation to talk to the doctors, the scientists, the mothers, children and villagers who have been left with the consequences of a major nuclear accident. It was grim. We went from hospital to hospital and from one contaminated village to another. We found deformed and genetically mutated babies in the wards; pitifully sick children in the homes; adolescents with stunted growth and dwarf torsos; foetuses without thighs or fingers and villagers who told us every member of their family was sick. This was 20 years after the accident but we heard of many unusual clusters of people with rare bone cancers. One doctor, in tears, told us that one in three pregnancies in some places was malformed and that she was overwhelmed by people with immune and endocrine system disorders. Others said they still saw caesium and strontium in the breast milk of mothers living far from the areas thought to be most affected, and significant radiation still in the food chain. Villages testified that \"the Chernobyl necklace\" – thyroid cancer – was so common as to be unremarkable; many showed signs of accelerated ageing. The doctors and scientists who have dealt directly with the catastrophe said that the UN International Atomic Energy Agency's \"official\" toll, through its Chernobyl Forum, of 50 dead and perhaps 4,000 eventual fatalities was insulting and grossly simplistic. The Ukrainian Scientific Centre for Radiation, which estimated that infant mortality increased 20 to 30% after the accident, said their data had not been accepted by the UN because it had not been published in a major scientific journal. Konstantin Tatuyan, one of the \"liquidators\" who had helped clean up the plant, told us that nearly all his colleagues had died or had cancers of one sort or another, but that no one had ever asked him for evidence. There was burning resentment at the way the UN, the industry and ill-informed pundits had played down the catastrophe. While there have been thousands of east European studies into the health effects of radiation from Chernobyl, only a very few have been accepted by the UN, and there have been just a handful of international studies trying to gauge an overall figure. They range from the UN's Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation study (57 direct deaths and 4,000 cancers expected) to the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), who estimated that more than 10,000 people had been affected by thyroid cancer alone and a further 50,000 cases could be expected. Moving up the scale, a 2006 report for Green MEPs suggested up to 60,000 possible deaths; Greenpeace took the evidence of 52 scientists and estimated the deaths and illnesses to be 93,000 terminal cancers already and perhaps 140,000 more in time. Using other data, the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences declared in 2006 that 212,000 people had died as a direct consequence of Chernobyl. At the end of 2006, Yablokov and two colleagues, factoring in the worldwide drop in births and increase in cancers seen after the accident, estimated in a study published in the annals of the New York Academy of Sciences that 985,000 people had so far died and the environment had been devastated. Their findings were met with almost complete silence by the World Health Organisation and the industry. So who can we trust when the estimates swing so wildly? Should we believe the empirical evidence of the doctors; or governments and industrialists backed by their PR companies? So politicised has nuclear energy become, that you can now pick and choose your data, rubbish your opponents, and ignore anything you do not like. The fact is we may never know the truth about Chernobyl because the records are lost, thousands of people from 24 countries who cleaned up the site have dispersed across the vast former Soviet Union, and many people have died. Fukushima is not Chernobyl, but it is potentially worse. It is a multiple reactor catastrophe happening within 150 miles of a metropolis of 30 million people. If it happened at Sellafield, there would be panic in every major city in Britain. We still don't know the final outcome but to hear experts claiming that nuclear radiation is not that serious, or that this accident proves the need for nuclear power, is nothing short of disgraceful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2011/apr/26/nikolaus-geyrhalter-abendland-stolz-review","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-26T12:59:00Z","webTitle":"Abendland - review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/26/nikolaus-geyrhalter-abendland-stolz-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2011/apr/26/nikolaus-geyrhalter-abendland-stolz-review","fields":{"headline":"Abendland - review","bodyText":"The Austrian film director Nikolaus Geyrhalter makes documentaries with neither commentary nor music, bearing witness to a sick world. Pripyat, released in 1999, described the ghost town beside the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Six years later Our Daily Bread explored the world of processed food. Presented as a curtain-raiser for the Diagonale Austrian film festival in Graz and now on general release, his latest offering, Abendland, focuses on Europe's obsession with technology and security. The word Abendland, the west in German, literally means \"evening land\", an implicit reference to our decadence. So what is so desirable about our lifestyle that makes so many people dream of partaking of it, and obliges us to raise walls to keep them out? Geyrhalter addresses this question in several powerful sequences, formed by a relentless stream of pictures – he recorded 170 hours of material, over a 14-month period, subsequently edited by Wolfgang Widerhofer. The staff at an undertaker's sort sealed and apparently identical metal urns after cremation; a nurse looks after bedridden women, offering a terrifying picture of what awaits us; police officers use a simulator to learn how to shoot at dangerous suspects; Bavarian Red Cross paramedics hold out a regulation bucket to catch the vomit of drinkers at the Munich Bierfest; shining bright in the night, the triple fence around Ceuta, equipped with electronic detectors and watched over by the Spanish Guardia Civil, protects us against immigrants. To end it all we are treated to a rave in a stadium, with a display of muscular bodies as impressive as the event is vacuous. All Geyrhalter's footage is at night because, as he explains, \"you see the structure more clearly, everything is more concentrated\". The sinister surprise party at which non-violent German environmental campaigners attempt to hold up a nuclear waste train is particularly memorable. Geyrhalter, 39, shares the Romantic fascination with twilight [something akin to Wagner's Götterdämmerung]. This pessimistic vision of the destruction of nature through human folly has gained new force since the Fukushima disaster in Japan, though Austrian public opinion was already hostile to nuclear power. But when his film was shown at Graz the director focused on the Arab revolts. Perhaps he feels that in the desert, littered with the wreckage of war, there is still some form of hope.

After the banking crisis of 2008, the cooling of the global economy had appeared to have given our wheezing, warming world pause for breath. As GDP went into reverse, so did energy use and the pumping of planet-heating gases into the atmosphere. Attempts to agree global action went into reverse at the same time, despite the 120 heads of state who burned the midnight oil in Copenhagen in 2009. But while the global economy has roared back to life, the UN's negotiations remain on life support, and with little hope of recovery. Two truths emerge from this mismatch. First, the link between economic growth and carbon dioxide must be broken. The world's economy runs on energy, and while most of that power continues to comes from coal, oil and gas, global GDP and carbon emissions will be bound together in lockstep. The latest data show a near perfect correlation, and that shows how little impact, in a worldwide context, renewable and nuclear power is making. Second, the rich industrialised world and the poor developing world must align their hopes and fears: they inhabit the same planet. All nations are united in understanding that unchecked climate change poses a grave threat in every part of the world. Citizens in London, New York and Tokyo have grown rich from a century or more of fossil-fuelled industrialisation. They have the most wealth to lose and are, with notable exceptions, the keenest to cut carbon fast. But for those in Delhi, Rio and Beijing, where economic growth surges onwards, the improvement of living standards, from electricity to education, is even more pressing than reducing emissions. Bridging that global gap between rich and poor requires a major transfer of wealth. That money, spent on low-carbon development, would fund the clean emergence of the developing world from deprivation. Put starkly, it is nothing less than using the engine of the world economy, energy, to tackle the world's poverty. It could be done by agreeing binding, global goals for cash and carbon: a top-down approach. But that would require unprecedented political leadership. Can the heating-up of the global economy thaw the diplomatic freeze at the UN talks and reignite the urgency needed? If not, a bottom-up route is all that remains. In this scenario, each government sets its own national goals and the people of the world hope they all add up to something short of calamity. The siren sounded by the IEA data is loud and clear. The world's economy is expanding again and belching out more carbon. The benign climate we have known since the dawn of civilisation looks about to blow. We are going to have to start re-engineering the global economy right now. If not, we will be forced into the even more daunting task of trying to re-engineer the Earth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/29/japan-cell-transplants-nuclear-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T20:52:58Z","webTitle":"Japanese officials consider cell transplants for nuclear workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-cell-transplants-nuclear-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-cell-transplants-nuclear-workers","fields":{"headline":"Japanese officials consider cell transplants for nuclear workers","bodyText":"Japanese authorities are considering plans to collect and freeze cells from engineers and water cannon operators at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in case they are exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. The proposal has been drawn up as a precautionary measure that could potentially save the lives of workers if they receive high doses of radiation while battling to bring the damaged nuclear reactors under control. High levels of radiation can cause serious illness and death from bone marrow failure, but the condition can be treated if patients are seen quickly enough and given transplants of blood stem cells collected before they are exposed. The procedure requires workers to take a drug for several days that causes their bone marrow to release stem cells into the blood. They are then hooked up to a machine through which their blood is passed and filtered to extract the stem cells. The procedure is already used to treat cancer patients whose bone marrow is destroyed by chemo- or radiotherapy. Alejandro Madrigal, scientific director at the Anthony Nolan transplant charity and president of the European group for blood and marrow transplantation, said the plan made sense given the risk to workers at Fukushima. He said more than 50 hospitals in Europe have agreed to help the Japanese if required. But Robert Peter Gale, a US medical researcher advising the Japanese government, said the move might cause more problems than it solves. \"It would be nifty if you could do it, but you are dealing with 800 workers and you might need these cells for only a small percentage of them.\" Another downside is that workers who have had their bone marrow cells stored might become cavalier and take unnecessary risks, Gale said. \"These cells can reconstitute bone marrow function; that is not the only target of high dose radiation, they would have damage elsewhere, to their lungs, gastrointenstinal tract and their skin. I, and a number of colleagues, feel it's not an appropriate thing to do.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/25/monbiot-live-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-25T10:59:44Z","webTitle":"Live Q&A: Monbiot on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/25/monbiot-live-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/25/monbiot-live-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Live Q&A: Monbiot on nuclear power","bodyText":"Join Britain's leading environmental commentator tomorrow to discuss one of the most divisive of green issues: nuclear power.

At first glance, President Correa looks the part of a 21st-century socialist. Yet in spite of his more progressive achievements, he has marginalised sectors of the left whose ideas he claims to champion, not least of which is CONAIE (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), arguably Ecuador's most prominent indigenous organisation. Indigenous social movements have accused Correa of criminalising dissent, stifling real democratic participation, and ignoring articles of the new constitution. Moreover, they claim the so-called \"new development paradigm\" is still fundamentally based on a neoliberal extractivist model, which rarely respects indigenous claims to land and resources. No doubt Correa's government has brought Ecuador much needed political reform and stability. However, excluding indigenous social movements from the democratic process maintains the status quo of historical inequalities and merely reproduces a scenario with which the rest of the world is all too familiar. Greg Nasmith Toronto, Ontario, Canada New lineup The arms lobby hates a foeless peace. So Iran is to take the enemy role of Saddam or the Taliban. War with Iran would be good for the arms business. Nuclear weapons are for self-protection. Iran is surrounded by nuclear states – Israel, Russia, China, Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan's ally India, not to mention seaborne American weapons. So it would be unsurprising if she really does want a nuclear bomb. Israel long ago introduced nuclear weapons to the Middle East, to deter Arab (and now also Iranian) aggression. Now it contemplates a preemptive strike to prevent nuclear competition. The US did nothing to discourage Israel's development of the bomb, but now it seems Washington might support action turning the whole region into a war zone. The US has long been Iran's Great Satan; now Iran has become hers. The region and the world will never forgive Israel and the US another war. 'A time for cool heads', as you said (20 January). Ren Kempthorne Nelson, New Zealand True costs In response to Clean energy faces 'time bomb' (3 February): the challenge of finding rare-earth metals for renewable energy is not new. A Scientific American report recognised the difficulty of sourcing low-cost Chinese neodymium for wind turbine gearboxes back in 2009. But the authors concluded \"the metals are not in short supply\" and manufacturers \"are moving toward gearless turbines ... so that limitation may become moot\". Rather than paint renewables as costly, why not focus on what is truly expensive? The \"time bombs\" that threaten our planet are coal and nuclear power. Gideon Forman Toronto, Ontario, Canada How do you know? Responsible, verifiable reporting should be the mandate of any serious journalism. In my opinion the opening paragraph in Creative answer to upheaval (3 February) fails on both counts. This is unfortunate because it detracts from what is, in its powerful simplicity, a very moving symbol of the struggles the Egyptian people are currently facing in their desire for regime change. My immediate reaction to the sentence stating that the stones in the lithographic montage were thrown by Egyptian military police at pro-democracy campaigners in Tahrir Square was to think that this must be a mistake – not because I don't believe for one minute that the Egyptian militia is a humanitarian protector of its people, but because one must surely question why such a controlling body, armed with guns and ammunition, tanks, tear gas and water cannon, would even bother to stop and gather rocks to throw at demonstrators. Then there is the inevitable question of \"How do you know?\" Did David Batty witness the event and see Foda pick up the very stones that had been thrown, and take them back to his studio to work on? Or did somebody film the incident? Or was the artist given the stones by someone else who said they had been thrown by the military? The statement would not have intruded on my appreciation of the work if Batty had simply added either \"... the artist said\" or \"... the artist claimed\". Furthermore, I should have thought that, if a greater sympathetic political dimension to the art were desired, then surely it is far more likely that the rocks were thrown at the military by the Egyptian protesters – sticks and stones seeming to be the only weapons available to the Egyptian protesters – and the David vs Goliath metaphor is a well-entrenched one worldwide. Who did the throwing is, in the end, irrelevant. The lithographic montage stands on its own merit as testimony to the ongoing courage of the Egyptian people. Just looking at the photograph moved me almost to tears; but after reading the unverifiable wording in the opening paragraph in Batty's report I felt distracted and manipulated.

I remembered when I was a kid, during the 39-45 war, our mission school in west China was being bombed by the Japanese, so we were flown over the hump to the far north-east of India, to Kalimpong to the St Andrews's Colonial Homes. During monsoon season, we sat on the veranda doing French knitting for days. I showed a sample to the third grade teacher who agreed to my teaching the children. My husband made spools for the children and I taught a few the first week. Then the teacher telephoned and asked: \"Can we skip the creative writing this week, and will you show all the others the knitting'? They are going demented waiting to learn!\" I did, and just as the article suggested, it was three boys who by the following week had knitted long enough tails for me to turn them into hats. The idea all started with that article! Betty Vander Els Shaftsbury, Vermont, US Briefly Your account of continuing human rights abuses in post-Gaddafi Libya made for depressing reading (27 January). If all that's been achieved is the replacement of one brutal regime with another, what was the point of it all?

Both events provide stark lessons about risks, and about how badly markets and societies can manage them. Of course, in one sense, there is no comparison between the tragedy of the earthquake – which has left more than 25,000 people dead or missing – and the financial crisis, to which no such acute physical suffering can be attributed. But when it comes to the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, there is a common theme in the two events. Experts in both the nuclear and finance industries assured us that new technology had all but eliminated the risk of catastrophe. Events proved them wrong: not only did the risks exist, but their consequences were so enormous that they easily erased all the supposed benefits of the systems that industry leaders promoted. Before the Great Recession, America's economic gurus – from the head of the Federal Reserve to the titans of finance – boasted that we had learned to master risk. \"Innovative\" financial instruments such as derivatives and credit default swaps enabled the distribution of risk throughout the economy. We now know that they deluded not only the rest of society, but even themselves. These wizards of finance, it turned out, didn't understand the intricacies of risk, let alone the dangers posed by \"fat-tail distributions\" – a statistical term for rare events with huge consequences, sometimes called \"black swans\". Events that were supposed to happen once in a century – or even once in the lifetime of the universe – seemed to happen every 10 years. Worse, not only was the frequency of these events vastly underestimated; so was the astronomical damage they would cause – something like the meltdowns that keep dogging the nuclear industry. Research in economics and psychology helps us understand why we do such a bad job in managing these risks. We have little empirical basis for judging rare events, so it is difficult to arrive at good estimates. In such circumstances, more than wishful thinking can come into play: we might have few incentives to think hard at all. On the contrary, when others bear the costs of mistakes, the incentives favour self-delusion. A system that socialises losses and privatises gains is doomed to mismanage risk. Indeed, the entire financial sector was rife with agency problems and externalities. Ratings agencies had incentives to give good ratings to the high-risk securities produced by the investment banks that were paying them. Mortgage originators bore no consequences for their irresponsibility, and even those who engaged in predatory lending or created and marketed securities that were designed to lose did so in ways that insulated them from civil and criminal prosecution. This brings us to the next question: are there other \"black swan\" events waiting to happen? Unfortunately, some of the really big risks that we face today are most likely not even rare events. The good news is that such risks can be controlled at little or no cost. The bad news is that doing so faces strong political opposition – for there are people who profit from the status quo. We have seen two of the big risks in recent years, but have done little to bring them under control. By some accounts, how the last crisis was managed may have increased the risk of a future financial meltdown. Too-big-to-fail banks, and the markets in which they participate, now know that they can expect to be bailed out if they get into trouble. As a result of this moral hazard, these banks can borrow on favourable terms, giving them a competitive advantage based not on superior performance, but on political strength. While some of the excesses in risk-taking have been curbed, predatory lending and unregulated trading in obscure, over-the-counter derivatives continue. Incentive structures that encourage excess risk-taking remain virtually unchanged. So, too, while Germany has shut down its older nuclear reactors, in the US and elsewhere, even plants that have the same flawed design as Fukushima continue to operate. The nuclear industry's very existence is dependent on hidden public subsidies – costs borne by society in the event of nuclear disaster, as well as the costs of the still-unmanaged disposal of nuclear waste. So much for unfettered capitalism! For the planet, there is one more risk, which, like the other two, is almost a certainty: global warming and climate change. If there were other planets to which we could move at low cost in the event of the almost certain outcome predicted by scientists, one could argue that this is a risk worth taking. But there aren't, so it isn't. The costs of reducing emissions pale in comparison to the possible risks the world faces. And that is true even if we rule out the nuclear option (the costs of which were always underestimated). To be sure, coal and oil companies would suffer, and big polluting countries – like the US – would obviously pay a higher price than those with a less profligate lifestyle. In the end, those gambling in Las Vegas lose more than they gain. As a society, we are gambling – with our big banks, with our nuclear power facilities, with our planet. As in Las Vegas, the lucky few – the bankers that put our economy at risk and the owners of energy companies that put our planet at risk – may walk off with a mint. But on average and almost certainly, we as a society, like all gamblers, will lose. That, unfortunately, is a lesson of Japan's disaster that we continue to ignore at our peril. © Project Syndicate 2011"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/08/japan-tsunami-one-year-parents-children","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-08T19:47:00Z","webTitle":"Japan tsunami: parents still praying for chance to lay their children to rest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/08/japan-tsunami-one-year-parents-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/08/japan-tsunami-one-year-parents-children","fields":{"headline":"Japan tsunami: parents still praying for chance to lay their children to rest","bodyText":"The trickle of visitors to Okawa primary school began soon after dawn. Three men in dark overcoats, their shaved heads exposed to the freezing elements, stepped out of their black sedan and bowed before a makeshift shrine that has come to symbolise the most distressing episode of the Japan tsunami disaster. Later, a woman arrived and lit sticks of incense, shielding them from the wind, then lingered in front of the tributes: paper cranes, plastic toys and dolls, a bell and bouquets of flowers. Beside them lay a stone carving of a mother cradling an infant bearing the words: \"Protect the children.\" The message carried extra poignancy for Miho Suzuki, whose two children were among the 74 pupils swept to their deaths last March, along with 10 staff. The body of her son, Kento, was discovered a week later, but after a year-long search, there is still no sign of her eight-year-old daughter, Hana. \"I can't say when or how this pain will end,\" said Suzuki, who makes daily pilgrimages to the school, its concrete shell one of the few structures left standing in Ishinomaki, where 3,097 people died and another 2,770 are still missing. \"We found our son, but we want Hana back, too. When they found my son's body I could at least rub his cold hands and wipe the mud from his face. Until Hana is back my family can't look forward. When she is with us again, perhaps that's when we can start to move on.\" The force of the waves carried bodies for miles along the Tohoku coast or out into the open sea. The official death toll from the disaster stands at 15,854, but another 3,274 – almost three-quarters of them aged 60 or over – are unaccounted for. The chances of recovering the corpses, now identifiable only by DNA samples, are receding by the day: search teams found at least 100 bodies a month soon after the disaster, but by the autumn, the number had dropped to a handful. In the fishing town of Kesennuma, police and coastguard crews conduct regular offshore searches in the hope of finding bodies trapped in cars or beneath wreckage resting on the seabed. On the morning the Guardian joined a search team aboard the patrol boat Sasakaze, divers braved icy water and low visibility but returned from the depths with nothing. Only two bodies have been recovered along the entire north-east coast since the start of the year, but coastguard officials insist that the search will go on. \"We know from experience how difficult it is to find people who have been swept out to sea,\" said Hirofumi Onodera, Kesennuma's coastguard captain, whose mother and eldest son are among the missing. \"But we've never thought for a moment of giving up.\" The lone figure of Wataru Sato stood at the water's edge, watching the divers surface briefly before they returned to the bottom of the harbour. Sato, a 68-year-old fisherman, spent weeks looking for his sister, Kiyako, after she was swept off a nearby bridge. \"I looked for her every day for 50 days, and then realised it was no use,\" said Sato, who lost 10 members of his extended family. \"I'm only just beginning to accept that she may never be found.\" The search for bodies continues against a dramatic change in the coastal landscape. Then-and-now photographs are testament to the speed with which the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima have cleared their disfigured cities, towns and villages of debris and rubble. Areas that were once a mass of shattered houses and mangled cars, and boats dragged in by the waves, are now flat, vacant spaces. Improvised memorials of stones, crockery and modest heirlooms are the only sign that these deserted tracts of land were once occupied by houses, shops and schools. But the tidy piles of debris – an estimated 23m tonnes of it – also point to an inertia that hangs over the north-east coast. So far only 6% of the rubble has been taken away to be recycled, buried or incinerated, with other regions opposed to taking in material they fear could be radioactive. Debris from Fukushima prefecture is to be stored locally. The environment minister, Goshi Hosono, admitted the current pace of disposal could derail plans to complete the job by March 2014: \"I want to speed up this process because it is a huge barrier to reconstruction efforts,\" he said. Local leaders, meanwhile, are still debating the wisdom of rebuilding in areas that history shows are susceptible to devastating tsunamis. So far not one of the municipalities affected by the disaster has submitted the necessary plans for reconstruction inland or on higher ground, blaming lack of resources and available land, and disagreement among residents. According to one survey, only about half the 6.7tn yen (£52bn) of the reconstruction budget approved last year has been spent, including less than 3% of the cash set aside to repairs roads, levees and sewers. Demand for building materials is rising, but there is little sign of the predicted post-tsunami construction boom, fuelled by government pledges of at least 19tn yen to \"reshape\" the battered coastline. Japan's new reconstruction agency, which has been given the job of slicing through the red tape delaying the recovery, was launched only last month. Yuhei Sato, the governor of Fukushima prefecture, spoke for many when he said: \"From the victims' perspective, I can't help but ask ... couldn't they have launched the agency sooner?\" No one, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has articulated a coherent vision for the Tohoku region's recovery. Officials appear reluctant to countenance anything that involves combining neighbouring towns into new, bigger entities, a measure that would sound the death knell for smaller communities but which some experts believe is inevitable. A solution to the rebuilding problem cannot come quickly enough for the 330,000 people living in temporary accommodation. Thousands of others have already left the region in search of jobs and a new start in cities such as Sendai and Tokyo. The exodus is being led by young people, who are abandoning ageing towns and villages that were afflicted by economic decline and depopulation long before the disaster. The immediate humanitarian crisis has given way to concerns about health problems associated with displacement and life in temporary accommodation – high blood pressure, pneumonia and heart disease – particularly among elderly people. In the three worst-affected prefectures, the deaths of more than 1,300 people after 11 March have been attributed to the disaster. The total, according to a survey by the Kyodo news agency, includes an undisclosed number of suicides among residents of temporary housing units. \"We are paying more attention to mental health issues now that the emergency response phase has ended,\" said Toshitaka Irie, a Japanese Red Cross worker. \"We are touring temporary housing complexes to try to get people to open up about their trauma. The problem is that in Japan, people tend to keep things to themselves.\" Serious damage to the health infrastructure is hampering efforts to provide healthcare to survivors dotted around a wide area. Hospitals and clinics were among the buildings that were crushed or swept out to sea, while others lie abandoned inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In Ishinomaki, however, there will be little discussion of the future until the wounds of the Okawa tragedy begin to heal. That is unlikely to happen soon. \"Some parents want to keep part of the school as a monument to the disaster,\" said Naomi Hiratsuka, whose 12-year-old daughter, Koharu, was among the victims. \"But I want it to be demolished. There is talk of replacing it with a park, but who would want their children to play in a place like this?\" In the distance, workers dredged a section of river as part of their search for the four missing children and one teacher. \"This search is just for show,\" said Hiratsuka, who obtained a digger's licence while she was searching for her daughter, whose remains were discovered last autumn, several miles from the spot where she died. \"The authorities want to be seen to be doing something for the anniversary. I have been asking them to conduct an intensive search for month, yet it's taken them almost a year to do anything.\" She said her daily search would continue: \"I'll do everything I can to get them back to their families. You look around here and think that everything has changed, but nothing will change as long as they are still somewhere out there.\" Some of the parents considered suing school officials for keeping the 108 children in their charge in the playground for 40 minutes before evacuating to a nearby bridge rather than up a steep hill located a short walk away. Suzuki understands their anger, but for her any recriminations will have to come later. \"No matter how angry I get with the teachers, it won't bring back my children,\" she said. \"What worries me most is that the authorities will call off the search because they're running out of money. But there are still places where we want them to look, even if there's only a small chance of finding anyone. I won't rest until every inch of ground has been covered.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-israel-poem-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-05T22:16:58Z","webTitle":"Günter Grass's Israel poem provokes outrage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-israel-poem-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-israel-poem-iran","fields":{"headline":"Günter Grass's Israel poem provokes outrage","bodyText":"During his long literary career, Günter Grass has been many things. Author, playwright, sculptor and, unquestionably, Germany's most famous living writer. There is the 1999 Nobel prize and Grass's broader postwar role as the country's moral conscience – albeit a claim badly undermined in 2006 when it emerged that the teenage Grass had served in the Waffen SS. But at the ripe old age of 84, Grass has triggered a furious row with a poem criticising Israel. Entitled What Must Be Said and published on Wednesday in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the lyric warns of a looming Israeli aggression against Iran. It argues that Germany should no longer deliver nuclear submarines to Israel that might carry \"all-destroying warheads\". Grass also takes aim at Germany's reluctance to offend Israel – reproaching himself for \"my silence\" on the subject, and acknowledging that he will inevitably face accusations of antisemitism. He muses: \"Why do I only speak out now/Aged and with my last drop of ink:/Israel's nuclear power is endangering/Our already fragile world peace?\" He supplies his own apocalyptic answer: it must be said because \"tomorrow might be too late\". Grass also calls for \"unhindered and permanent monitoring of Israel's nuclear facility and Iran's nuclear facility through an international entity\". Ultimately, he suggests, this would help everybody in this \"delusional\" region, including the Germans – or \"us\", as he puts it. Hardly surprising, then, that Grass's controversial late lyric has provoked indignation. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, led the attack on Thursday, asserting: \"Günter Grass's shameful moral equivalence between Israel and Iran ... says little about Israel and much about Mr Grass.\" Netanyahu described Iran as \"a regime that denied the Holocaust and threatens to annihilate Israel\". He added: \"It is Iran, not Israel, that is a threat to the peace and security of the world.\" Netanyahu's attack then became more personal: \"For six decades, Mr Grass hid the fact that he had been a member of the Waffen SS. \"So for him to cast the one and only Jewish state as the greatest threat to world peace and to oppose giving Israel the means to defend itself is perhaps not surprising.\" The Israeli embassy in Berlin took the format of Grass's poem and flung it back at him: \"What must be said is that it is a European tradition to accuse the Jews before the Passover festival of ritual murder.\" It concluded that Grass's ill-judged broadside sprung from Germany's own guilty conscience – \"part of the German people's efforts to come to terms with the past\". German politicians from both left and right have traditionally been supportive of Israel, for obvious historical reasons. Several have criticised Grass, describing his work as \"abominable\", \"irritating\" and \"over the top\". The bestselling Bild, a paper better known for its topless models, complained of \"confused poesie\". And writing in Die Welt, the Jewish writer Henryk Border dubbed Grass \"the prototype of the educated antisemite\". He added, for good measure, that Grass was \"completely nuts\". All this forced Grass to offer his own pained reply. In an interview with North German Radio, the author complained on Thursday that the tone of the criticism \"didn't just concentrate on the contents of the poem\" but amounted to a scurrilous campaign to say that his reputation \"had been damaged for all time\". He added: \"The old cliches are used. And to a certain extent they are damaging.\" Some commentators, however, offered a more convincing critique: that Grass wasn't antisemitic, but simply didn't know what he was talking about. True, the Nobel prizewinner describes Iran's leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a \"bigmouth\", or \"Maulheld\". But otherwise, critics say, he offers a less than convincing analysis of the situation in the Middle East – failing to acknowledge, for example, Iran's regular threats to wipe Israel out. Instead Grass raises the unlikely spectre of Israel \"annihilating\" the Iranian people – using a German verb, auslöschen, which comes dangerously close to evoking the Holocaust. \"The poem is more interesting to Grassologists than to stragetic analysts,\" the Israeli historian Tom Segev, who has met and interviewed Grass, told the Guardian. Segev called the lyric \"rather pathetic\". He said it was \"idiotic\" to describe the writer as an antisemite, but said Grass would be better served expending his last ink on a different creative project. \"He's a great writer. He's 84. I hope he uses his last drops to write a good book.\" He added that the writer appeared to have \"some inner psychological need to be accused wrongly\", adding: \"He's almost wishing people to say he's an antisemite.\" The most interesting commentary, arguably, came from the Süddeutsche Zeiting, which published the poem – German title Was gesagt werden muss – in a supplement. Grass had been writing poems since 1955 but his late ones weren't really poems at all, Thomas Steinfeld observed, and instead resembled pleas, complaints, or angry letters to the editor. Of one lugubrious chunk he writes witheringly: \"The only lyrical things here are the arbitary line breaks.\" Undoubtedly, the poem's portentous tone doesn't help the reader; an opinion page piece might have served Grass better. Interestingly, Steinfeld suggests that the award of the Nobel prize for literature in 1999 may have contributed to Grass's latest political intervention. The prize transformed Grass from a national figure – \"Germany's preceptor\" – to an unashamedly global one – \"a custodian of world politics\". He argues that Grass is the only winner who feels the urge to comment on global affairs. Gabriel García Márquez has not become a literary-political representative of South America, he notes, nor has JM Coetzee become the voice of South Africa, or Derek Walcott that of the Caribbean. Nor has Grass, it might be added, written a poem on Greece, a crisis nearer to Germany's doorstep and wallet. Grass last attracted this much attention back in 2006, when he revealed in his autobiography, Peeling the Onion, that he had briefly served as a 17-year-old in the Waffen SS at the end of the second world war. The admission in itself wasn't remarkable: many other teenagers of his generation were forced to join the SS as the war entered its chaotic final phase. What irritated was the fact that Grass had taken so long to admit this – an inexplicable delay for someone who blamed others for their Nazi pasts and was seen to personify national atonement and self-criticism. For some, this detail means that Grass forfeited the right to comment on the Jewish state. Ephraim Zuroff, director of the Nazi-hunting Simon Wisenthal Centre, described him as \"totally compromised\" and added: \"The tin drum he is banging is not the one of moral conscience but of deep-seated prejudice against the Jewish people.\" This is one view. In fact Grass's critical opinions on Israel have surfaced before. In an interview with Spiegel Online in 2001, he described the \"appropriation\" of Palestinian territory by Israeli settlers as a \"criminal activity\", adding: \"That not only needs to be stopped – it also needs to be reversed.\" It is certainly true that Germany's relationship with Israel is a problematic one, with the Holocaust taught in schools and the issue of historical guilt never far beneath the surface. According to Constanze Stelzenmuller, senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, it is hardly surprising that Germany has a moral obligation to the state of Israel, given the country's past. \"The German government has been very clear about this,\" she said. Berlin has already supplied it with three Dolphin submarines, with two more being built, and a sixth in the pipeline. But, Stelzenmuller says, Berlin has not been inhibited from criticising Israel, especially on the issue of Israeli settlements, last mentioned by Germany's defence minister two weeks ago. Of Grass, she said: \"There's always been an anti-Zionist tendency in the European left, including in the German left. It isn't pretty. Many modern thinkers on the centre-left deplore this.\" Amid the criticism, a few voices came forward to defend Grass – the author, after all, of The Tin Drum, the great German novel of the second world war and the rise of Nazism. \"It's got to be possible to speak openly without being denounced as an enemy of Israel,\" said Klaus Staeck, the president of the Berlin academy of art. He called the \"reflexive condemnation\" of Grass as an antisemite inappropriate, and insisted that Grass was merely expressing his concern about developments in the Middle East. \"A lot of people share this worry,\" Staeck added. Predictably, Iran warmly welcomed Grass's poem. Press TV, Iran's state-owned English-language satellite channel, hailed it as a literary sensation. \"Never before in Germany's postwar history has a prominent intellectual attacked Israel in such a courageous way,\" it said. \"Metaphorically speaking, the poet has launched a deadly lyrical strike against Israel.\" The Press TV report also observed: \"Israel is the only possessor of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and it has never allowed inspections of its nuclear facilities nor has it joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty based on its policy of nuclear ambiguity.\" What Must Be Said by Günter Grass But why have I kept silent till now? Because I thought my own origins, Tarnished by a stain that can never be removed, meant I could not expect Israel, a land to which I am, and always will be, attached, to accept this open declaration of the truth. Why only now, grown old, and with what ink remains, do I say: Israel's atomic power endangers an already fragile world peace? Because what must be said may be too late tomorrow; and because – burdened enough as Germans – we may be providing material for a crime that is foreseeable, so that our complicity wil not be expunged by any of the usual excuses. And granted: I've broken my silence because I'm sick of the West's hypocrisy; and I hope too that many may be freed from their silence, may demand that those responsible for the open danger we face renounce the use of force, may insist that the governments of both Iran and Israel allow an international authority free and open inspection of the nuclear potential and capability of both."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/25/uk-renewables-2030-wwf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-25T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Renewables could be UK's major power source by 2030: WWF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/25/uk-renewables-2030-wwf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/25/uk-renewables-2030-wwf","fields":{"headline":"Renewables could be UK's major power source by 2030: WWF","bodyText":"The UK could be primarily powered by a secure and inexhaustible supply of renewable energy by 2030 without the need for new nuclear power plants, according to a report commissioned by WWF. Between 60% and 90% of the nation's electricity could come from wind, solar, tidal and other sustainable sources, with the rest supplied via an international supergrid and gas power stations. \"This report is inspiring, but also entirely realistic. It shows that a clean, renewable energy future really is within our grasp,\" said David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK. \"Failure to commit to a high-renewables future would leave us facing the prospect of dangerous levels of climate change and high energy prices.\" The soaring cost of energy bills has become a major political issue, with the prime minister, David Cameron, recently convening a meeting of industry energy leaders. The new report notes that meeting an existing 2020 renewable energy target will increase household bills by 4%, but that this could be more than offset by cuts in usage through better energy efficiency. \"Developing a low carbon and sustainable power sector in the UK is first and foremost a question of political will,\" concludes the report, which comes at a time when the Conservative party's commitment to be the \"greenest government ever\" is being seriously questioned. The report states backing renewables would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and new economic growth. \"Investing in clean energy offers us a means to tackle the two most crucial market failures that now confront the world: the financial crisis and climate change,\" said Nussbaum. \"The only question that remains is, are we bold enough to take it?\" The report was welcomed by a host of businesses, including one the UK's \"big six\" energy suppliers, SSE. \"It's a useful addition to the debate,\" said Keith MacLean, SSE's policy and research director. \"Sufficient certainty that renewables will be a long term part of the energy system, well beyond the current 2020 cliff edge, is needed in order to allow the industry to mature and put renewables on a path of cost reduction that will steadily reduce and eliminate the need for support.\" WWF's Positive Energy report differs from previous analyses by including a continuation of renewable energy building after 2020, as well as big increases in energy efficiency. The energy scenarios at the core of the report were developed by GL Garrad Hassan, the world's largest renewable energy consultancy and part of the GL Group, which also works in the oil and gas industries. In the highest renewables scenarios (90% of capacity), ambitious action on energy efficiency reduces the capital costs of renewables, gas and supergrid interconnectors from £216bn to £170bn. The report calls for a firm renewable target for 2030, to give long-term and stable financial support for the renewable industry. The WWF report sets out a far more ambitious role for renewable electricity than the 45% predicted by the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, in its renewable energy review in May. But WWF points out that the build rates in its scenarios are actually lower than the government's own forecasts in its national renewable energy action plan and significantly below industry projections on realistic build rates. The difference is that in WWF's scenarios, rather than build rates falling rapidly after 2020, growth is maintained. The electricity not generated from renewables in the report's scenarios comes instead from gas power. In the most ambitious 90% scenarios, the carbon emissions from those gas plants do not need to be captured and stored underground in order to meet the UK's climate change targets, but in the less ambitious 60% scenarios, about one-third of the gas plants would require carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to be fitted. There are no coal plants of any sort in the scenarios, or nuclear plants. The report warns of the danger in the less ambitious scenarios of being \"locked-in\" to high carbon emissions, because once unabated gas plants are built, operators will want to run them as much as possible to make a return. In the 60% scenarios, without significant supergrid interconnectors, the gas plants would run just 33% of the time. The warning that a new \"dash for gas\" could lock in high carbon emissions is echoed in another report published on Tuesday, from MPs on the Commons select committee on energy and climate change. The MPs state the current proposals for electricity market reform put too much emphasis on building new gas plants to fill the gap left by the closure of about 19GW of nuclear, oil-fired and coal-fired plants by 2020, and not enough on decarbonising the power sector over the course of the 2020s in which gas without CCS will have \"only a very limited role\". The climate and energy secretary, Chris Huhne, told the Guardian last month that the government \"will not consent so much gas plant so as to endanger our carbon dioxide goals\". The MPs' report also echoes WWF's call for more action on energy efficiency. \"The government could be doing a lot more to reduce unnecessary energy wastage,\" said Tim Yeo MP, the Conservative chairman of the committee. \"It needs to look at how it can use building regulations and energy efficiency standards for electrical appliances to cut waste and save cash on people's energy bills.\" The committee's report additionally calls for much more gas storage capacity in the UK, to minimise the damage from supply interruptions or price spikes. The UK's current storage capacity is just 14 days' worth of gas, states the report, \"a dangerously low level compared with France which has 87 days' worth of gas storage, Germany 69 and Italy 59.\" Energy minister Charles Hendry said: \"Energy security is right at the heart of the coalition's energy policy. We are reforming the electricity market to encourage investment in new power stations. We have also legislated for a mass roll-out of energy efficiency measures across Britain's housing stock through the green deal.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2011/aug/16/charlotte-roche-sex-novel-schossgebete","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-16T14:23:35Z","webTitle":"Charlotte Roche revisits mix of sex and controversy in new novel, Schossgebete","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/16/charlotte-roche-sex-novel-schossgebete","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/aug/16/charlotte-roche-sex-novel-schossgebete","fields":{"headline":"Charlotte Roche revisits mix of sex and controversy in new novel, Schossgebete","bodyText":"When Charlotte Roche had her debut novel published in 2008 she scandalised Germany's book world with a tale about a teenager sent to hospital for an intimate shaving injury who spends her days masturbating with an avocado stone. Proving that nothing sells better than sex with a whiff of controversy, Feuchtgebiete, or Wetlands, shifted more than 2m copies. It became the world's bestselling novel that year and established the British-born Roche, until then known best as a youth TV presenter, as a literary force. Now the 33-year-old is back with an equally explicit follow-up which is creating just as much fuss. But while her debut was praised for portraying female sexuality in its rawest form, her latest book, Schoßgebete, which explores sex within marriage, has been derided by Germany's most famous feminist as an ode to patriarchy. Alice Schwarzer, Germany's answer to Germaine Greer, has written an open letter to Roche accusing her of using sex as a \"sales gimmick\" and of viewing intercourse \"clinically through a microscope\". Schoßgebete's title has dual meaning in German. A Stoßgebet is a last-ditch prayer, and Schoß is a poetic term for female genitals. Sex, it suggests, might be a kind of feminist prayer. The book's publishers are hoping for another hit; half a million copies were printed in the first run and on Tuesday it was top of the charts on Amazon's German site. Schwarzer claims Roche is not presenting a new, enlightened, outlook on women and sex, but one which promotes a patriarchal view of sex whereby women do what their men want in bed to keep them happy. It is a worldview which, says Schwarzer, her grandmother would have lived by – and \"grandmothers, by the way, only played along with everything so that their man stayed\". She suggests the book is potentially dangerous. \"It would be fatal if your women readers treated your deviant tearjerker about sex and love as a recipe to follow. You don't have the solution, but the problem.\" Schwarzer has her own axe to grind. She makes a cameo in the imagination of Elizabeth, the book's heroine, telling the character that she is not really having an orgasm, but that \"you are just imagining it in order to submit yourself to your husband and his mighty penis\". The book opens with a 15-page, first-person description of 33-year-old Elizabeth giving oral sex to her second husband, Georg. The scene starts with her turning on the couple's electric blanket, and lying down next to Georg, who is wearing XXL yoga leggings. Between slurps, Elizabeth ruminates on how her overbearing feminist mother disapproves of her enjoyment of sex and muses on how her man smells like \"my grandma's kitchen when she has been frying fish on her gas stove\". Later in the book Elizabeth and Georg have a threesome with a prostitute. Elizabeth is prone to blurting out aphorisms, such as \"it's easier to give a blow job than make coffee\" and \"you should be just as happy with the breasts you have as you are with the futility of existence\". Feminists are not the only ones complaining about Schoßgebete. On Monday Roche's stepfather entered the fray to say that she had used a family tragedy to sell books. In 2001 three of Roche's brothers died in a car crash on their way to her wedding in England. An almost identical tragedy unfolds in Schoßgebete. \"Without consideration, scruples or respect, our family misfortune is being put on display and marketed,\" Ulrich Busch told Stern magazine's website. Roche's publishers turned down the Guardian's request to talk to her, but in an interview with Der Spiegel published last week Roche said she had to write about the accident. \"I had the feeling that I had to get it out. I've still not grieved, not even a bit.\" Last year Roche offered to have sex with the German president, Christian Wulff, if he decommissioned the country's nuclear power stations. Despite, or perhaps because of, the latest controversy, the book has largely been well reviewed. Der Spiegel said it was \"like a cross between a column for a women's magazine and a stream of consciousness work in the James Joyce mould, which provides a glimpse into the mind of a modern multitasker\". In the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Henryk M Broder said of Roche: \"She does what she wants without worrying what Simone de Beauvoir or Andrea Dworkin would say about it.\" A spokeswoman for Piper, Roche's German publishers, said Schoßgebete would probably appear in English in 2012."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2012/mar/08/will-to-govern-leveson-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-08T13:23:15Z","webTitle":"The will to govern shows signs of life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/mar/08/will-to-govern-leveson-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2012/mar/08/will-to-govern-leveson-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"The will to govern shows signs of life","bodyText":"I was delighted to see on last night's TV news that Kautilya Pruthi, Britain's answer to the Ponzi fraudster, Bernie Madoff, is facing a stiff jail sentence for stealing more than £100m from gullible investors to finance an embarrassingly vulgar lifestyle featuring lots of cars, property and swimming pools. The trial ended on Wednesday. Glad too, therefore, to read this week that the Financial Services Authority is prosecuting an ambitious case of insider trading, involving allegations at Southwark crown court that share tips were stolen from the printing operations of two of the City of London's biggest investment banks. It is part of the FSA's drive – belated, some would say – to stamp out this sort of conduct. We must wait a while, probably some time, for guilty or innocent verdicts on the seven accused. Either way, these actions deserve a cheer. Why am I so pleased? Because both suggest a willingness by the authorities to enforce the law in ways that are often painfully absent. Contrary to what is often asserted about the power of Britain's political and bureaucratic elite – my old chum Peter Oborne's ridiculous 2007 book The Triumph of the Political Class is a good example of that – we usually see a serious loss of nerve and the desire for a quiet life. Has it been getting steadily worse during my lifetime? Or is what we are seeing in terms of cover-ups exposed and demands for greater transparency and accountability – from City boardrooms to the cabinet table and beyond – a sign that Britain is getting its act together under the pressures of globalisation and is still a going concern despite its many batterings? Look around you. What is the Leveson inquiry and assorted related police investigations but a belated attempt to stand up to over-mighty media groups (Rupert, I'm talking about you) who thought they were above the law and acted accordingly. The surprise is genuine among some of my News International colleagues that the police should come after them in the kind of flashy dawn raids the tabloids relish for others. Yet it is beyond dispute that their bosses engaged in a serious high-level cover-up over phone hacking and much else over a long period of time. We learned from ex-Met copper Bob Quick at the Leveson inquiry on Wednesday that bribing coppers for information had been known about at Scotland Yard since at least 2000, though I cannot be alone in having known about it for rather longer. It was just one of those things that reporters from papers which did not flourish a chequebook had to live with. Yet only the other day, Kit Malthouse, Boris Johnson's deputy London mayor, was reported as dismissing the whole Leveson-related investigation as \"media driven hysteria\" which was wasting valuable police resources. He's certainly right about police time, but surely wrong about the implied frivolity of the affair. It's serious and it's about corruption involving major institutions of the state, the police, the media and a cowed political elite. Malthouse sounded like an authentic voice of the quiet-life crowd who don't want the light let in. We also learned on Wednesday that the Tories had frightened off the Met's 2008 inquiry into relations between Damian Green, then the Conservative's immigration spokesman, and Chris Galley, a civil servant who was leaking damaging data about Labour's performance in office. Bob Quick, formerly counter-terrorism chief, felt he was turned over by the Daily Mail and its Sunday sister. He was, though he fell through a mistake of his own: allowing secret papers to be filmed in the street. I read it all rather differently at the time. By all means investigate a politician receiving information which threatened national security – if that was true – but politicians have always been leaked information for patriotic reasons (think Churchill and defence readiness in the 1930s). Long may it continue if it can be justified in the public interest. The same defence exists for newspapers, though some have a problem understanding what it means. What the cops did in 2008 was different. They both arrested Green and raided his Westminster office, which struck me as seriously overstepping the constitutional mark that protects MPs going about their lawful business. Admittedly, the Sergeant at Arms, Jill Pay, gave the OK for the raid and the then Speaker, Michael Martin, blamed her. Both were at fault and weightier holders of their offices would have told the boys in blue to pursue their inquiries elsewhere and by other means. Coming so soon after the doomed investigation by Yard troubleshooter John Yates into Tony Blair's alleged loans-for-honours practices, it struck me as the Met's attempt to show it was being even-handed between the political parties, but also to give the politicians another kicking. (Interestingly, Quick said on Wednesday that Yates refused to let his phone records be examined after claims that he was leaking details to pile pressure on the Blair camp.) Remember, we'd just seen Ian Blair, Ken Livingstone's and Tony (no relation) Blair's idea of a modern Met commissioner, forced out by Kit Malthouse's boss, Boris Johnson. Ian Blair championed community policing, which voters like, but he wasn't popular at the Met. One of the issues that has come up at Leveson is claims that senior officers and their press staff briefed against him. It's all coming out now. The Met seems to be saying that it learned these dirty habits – cosying up to the Murdochs and their kind, briefing against each other via friendly journalists – from the politicians down the road at Westminster. Well, maybe, but I'm not sure the old Met was either so wholesome or so innocent. The late Sir Robert Mark was brought in to clean it up 40 years ago, a work in progress like painting the Forth Bridge. As for the political class, I seem to recall that they learned to market themselves from the worlds of business and finance, from TV and marketing men in the US like Roger Ailes, who reconstructed Richard Nixon's image in the 60s and later worked for Ronald Reagan. What does Ailes – 72 in May – do for a living? Bless my soul, he's now president of Rupert Murdoch's pernicious but successful Fox News, the TV channel which is busily misleading millions of Tea Party voters on so many (though not all) issues, not least the vital role of the state in educating and protecting them in a tough world. My working assumption is that the political class – and, alas, elements within the law and order agencies – have slowly been bent to the will of the moneyed elite, not least via the media branch of that elite, in the 40 years since the war-hardened generation that made the postwar settlement began fading away and the free-market crowd staged a cyclical revival. It's not cut and dried and the battle goes on in different forms, as it always does. But when I see top taxmen at HMRC cutting private deals on tax bill owed by big corporations I feel as I sometimes do when ministers tell us (because officials have told them) that it's jolly hard to bear down on wealthy non-domiciles who enjoy living here but avoid their share of tax. Many of these issues exist in an acute form in the plutocratic US – the age of the Victorian robber baron is back – and so do some of the more visible remedies. Since 2009 the federal authorities in New York have prosecuted 66 people for insider trading, mostly arising from the collapse of Wall St, and got 57 convictions or guilty pleas. The FSA in London has a long way to go. The FBI and the securities and exchange commission, the US version of the soon-to-be-reformed-again FSA, have both a tougher mind-set and the power to tap phones and use the material in court. This is vital in cosy insider trading cases such as the one which convicted the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group, who is now serving 11 years. It's hard to prove a tip led to a lucrative trade for a privileged insider. But it can be done. The FT's John Gapper writes that lack of will is one FSA problem and lack of admissible wire-tap information is another. The FSA has traditionally relied on civil cases and fines, which are modest in terms of profits made. It got its first insider trading conviction in 2009, though there have been a couple of big ones since. White-collar crooks in the US fear the Feds – Madoff got 150 years in jail – and they need to do so here. Margaret Hodge's warning, as chair of the Commons public accounts committee that multinational IT firms should no longer see Britain as a soft touch is a start. My sense is that the generation that won the war, the young ex-servicemen and women as well as the leadership, emerged from that exhausting conflict determined to make a better world than was created after 1918. In the welfare state and much else they succeeded. The country was broke and the settlement they made was state-orientated. Everyone felt more entitled, but other economic models were doing better. When Labour failed to rule effectively in the 1970s (so did Ted Heath, under whom Margaret Thatcher served) the stage was set for the free market revival, which has done good things as well as bad. Gradually the old elite lost its nerve and its will to govern, hence the farming out of all sorts of functions to the private sector or to Europe, which was briefly the panacea that would rescue us. It hasn't done so: panaceas never do. But problems are never entirely solved either and – as with the true cost of another postwar panacea, nuclear power – it's better to know what they are and see them clearly. That's one vital step to the solution.

Its burgeoning nuclear activities are not in contravention of international law. There are several countries that have nuclear weapons and are not subject to scrutiny and inspection from the IAEA, most notably Israel. It remains a source of contention that this institution is prepared to tolerate Israel's policy of deliberate ambiguity. Additionally, countries such as India and Pakistan could never have obtained their nuclear capability without the consent of the US. Neither of these nations is a signed up member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, while Iran is. Iran has little reason to trust the west. Its first more or less democratically elected leader, Mossadegh was toppled from power in a CIA coup in 1953, with Britain's blessing and support. Iran's real offence is to strongly criticise the west's double standards regarding foreign policy in the region and to remain in control of its resources. The crux of the matter lies within this power structure, and so the west must support wars in the Middle East every two or three years to preserve's Israel's position as the only viable, militarised nuclear state in the region. Indeed, the aim of recently imposed sanctions may well be to go even further and covertly instigate regime change, illegal under international law. Reference to Iran's' repressive government has little leverage in light of Saudi Arabia's record and its repression of democracy in Bahrain. David Cameron's recent visit to the region to sell more weapons to Saudis reflects this amorality. Anna Romano Oman Growing power Alina Paul-Bossuet introduces the concept of mini-packs of farm inputs for smallholder farmers as some recent marketing innovation of the multinationals (Little things make all the difference, 6 January). Both national and international NGOs working in India have seen the need for such approaches for decades. And they identified the need to go further than fertilisers and ubiquitous agro-chemicals. The most important addition is seeds. In the 1990s, the Maharishi Academy in Bangalore and the International Agricultural Training Programme initiated home vegetable production for groups of women of scheduled caste and tribal families in villages in the Kanakapura district of Karnataka state. The package provided a balanced variety of leaf, fruit and legume seeds plus a small amount of fertiliser. In addition, the women's groups received guidance on compost making and sowing and cultivation. Waste household water was saved and used to irrigate the crops, and the groups were guided in multi-cropping systems and rotations. The crops were grown by individuals on micro-plots around their houses. Perhaps most important, the women knew how to cook and serve the produce and so significantly improved their household diets. By-and-large the varieties were open-pollinated, and the collection of seed by individual growers promoted the sustainability of the activity. The spread and promotion of the success of such micro-technologies is often so limited that the same innovation is \"reinvented\" time after time. Jeremy Groome Xian, China Historical lesson It is unfortunate that John Mulholland misdirected himself through believing that Ghana experienced 83 years of British colonial rule between 1884 and 1957 (Why Ghana aims to be an aid-free zone, 20 January), for he might then have realised that the changing south to north pattern that he describes largely repeats itself. Fort James at Accra was held continuously from 1672, in association with other coastal forts. The Gold Coast colony was created formally in 1872, while British rule was extended to Asante (Ashanti) in 1896 and to the Northern Territories more laxly in 1897. A portion of the former German colony of Togo passed in law into British hands only after the Treaty of Versailles. The area that became Ghana was administered by the British as \"the Gold Coast\" for only 38 years, not 83, a fact of some relevance for an understanding of development patterns within the modern state. Philip Stigger, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada More than hot air Urban population boom threatens Lake Titicaca (20 January) reminds us that there are many different forms of pollution threatening human life on our planet besides greenhouse gases. In recent years, we have been getting the message from the overwhelming majority of climate scientists that combatting the production of greenhouse houses is humanity's number one priority. I believe it is essential that we take effective action as soon as possible to rectify the problem, but we should not forget that we need to be also making more effort to prevent human populations from being exposed to all forms of pollution. We should never forget the big human disasters caused by the heavy metal pollution in Minamata Bay over many years during the 20th century; the methyl isocyanate emissions from the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal in 1984; the release of radioactive substances at the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plants; the release of dioxins from a pesticide plant in Seveso in 1976; the contamination of water supplies by hexavalent chromium in California during the 1990s, and the ongoing saga with asbestos. Andy Alcock Forestville, South Australia • Jenny Goldie (Letters, 20 January) called for preparations for oil's decline. Given that our agricultural system relies on oil-based fertilisers and the use of large-scale machinery, which also depends on oil, how do we continue to produce food? One possibility is a shift to an agricultural national service, where all young people undertake agricultural work for two years after they complete their schooling. It is likely that oil depletion will force some shift in our social organisation towards a stronger emphasis on sharing resources and less emphasis on individualism. An agricultural national service could easily come about as part of this social shift. Mary Fairburn Flegg Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Speaking out Charles Hannan (Letters, 27 January) chooses an unfortunate example when he complains about redundant words formed with the suffix \"ess\". The richness of English is its many near synonyms. Mischievousness refers to delight in causing mischief – not quite the same as mischief itself. There is a similar distinction between cheerfulness and cheer. In 43 years as an English teacher in London, Yorkshire and Canada, I have learned to be tolerant of different varieties of English. Here in Ontario it's hard not to regret the loss of shades of meaning, as between alternate/alternative, continuous/continual, disinterested/uninterested, may/might, eg/ie, but after all, the shoreline of English is in constant flux, and erosion in one area is balanced by rich new land elsewhere. John Caryl Orillia, Ontario, Canada • In Charles Hannan's letter, he has not mentioned the \"ality's\", as in \"marginality, provisionality, dysfunctionality, commonality, modularity, regionality, logicality, normality, disproportionality, (and most common of all), criminality\". I could go on and on. Perhaps I have an obsessionality with Bush-type words, but these were all heard quite recently on the BBC Today programme, or read in your own lovely organ. Susie Vereker, Larroque, France Briefly • I wholeheartedly agree with Larry Elliott's assessment of policymakers' poor response to the global financial crisis (3 February). There appears to be a lack of imagination and, especially in the US and Canada, a disappointing fallback to debunked trickle-down economics, so the rich are revered as the sacred job-creating cows and the dwindling middle class is left to carry the sacred cow. Elliott's article, however, appears to have one small omission. He states that the failure to act decisively was \"the fault of inertia, complacency and error\". I humbly submit that \"lobbying\" be added to the list. There is a powerful desire to keep the public shouldering the debt write-offs. Dave Scott Toronto, Canada There is no better way of ensuring the continuation of violence and terrorism than the incarceration of Palestinian children in Israeli jails (27 January), where their hatred is fomented and their terrorist ambitions hardened. It is significant and hopeful that these blatant abuses of human and children's rights have been addressed by the courageous Israeli group B'Tselem.

On Friday the artist will sign a contract to buy the Mülheim-Kärlich reactor, a decommissioned nuclear power station near Koblenz, Germany. And on the same day Kiefer, one of Germany's most celebrated postwar artists, will attend the opening night of his biggest show ever in Britain, spread over 11,000 sq ft of the newly opened White Cube gallery in south London. Kiefer's art is deeply serious, dense with both esoteric symbolism and political meaning. The show, Il Mistero delle Cattedrali, takes its title from a 1926 book by Fulcanelli, a mysterious figure who practised alchemy, and contains monumental paintings and sculptures alluding to ideas from the philosopher's stone to the second world war. \"Art is difficult,\" says the 66-year-old firmly. \"It's not entertainment. There are only a few people who can say something about art – it's very restricted. When I see a new artist I give myself a lot of time to reflect and decide whether it's art or not. Buying art is not understanding art.\" Kiefer, 66, misses the days of the 70s and 80s when art collectors such as Donald Fisher – founder of the Gap clothing stores – took a year to decide whether they wanted to buy a work or not. He refuses to allow his works to be auctioned, or even for his gallerists to discuss the art market with him. Though he has been acclaimed by critics such as Simon Schama, who called him \"incapable of producing trivia\", and was the first artist since Georges Braque in 1953 to make a work to go permanently on show at the Louvre, Kiefer regards himself as underground compared with artists like Damien Hirst, who he says makes \"anti-art\". But he's at pains to point out that this \"anti-art\" is itself part of art. \"Art has something which destroys its own cells,\" says Kiefer. \"Damien Hirst is a great anti-artist. To go to Sothebys and sell your paintings directly\" – as Hirst did in 2008 – \"is destroying art. But in doing it to such an exaggerated extent, it becomes art. I liked this action, the Sotheby's sale, and the fact that it was two days before the crash made it even better.\" In fact, Hirst's auction, which netted £93m, and the collapse of Lehman Brothers happened at the same time, 15-16 September. It sounds as though Kiefer, who was born in the Black Forest but has lived in France since 1991, endorses Charles Saatchi's view that the art world is eurotrashy, vulgar and masturbatory. \"He described himself, no?\" says the artist, laughing uproariously. \"[These days] art becomes fashion, it becomes [financial] speculation, but Saatchi started it.\" Ever since his first famous work Occupations (Bezetzung), in which Kiefer, then a student, photographed himself giving the Nazi salute in different locations around Europe, the artist has interrogated Germany's relationship with its dark past. One room in the current exhibition includes four enormous paintings depicting Tempelhof airport in Berlin, which closed down in 2008. Built in 1927, the Nazis intended the enormous structure to be their gateway to Europe in Albert Speer's redesigned Berlin. It was described as \"the mother of all airports\" by architect Norman Foster. \"Germans want to forget [the past] and start a new thing all the time, but only by going into the past can you go into the future,\" says Kiefer. At the moment, he complains, \"they have fashion shows at Tempelhof and all this nonsense. There's an office, an ice skating rink – it's trivialising. I wrote [Berlin's cultural department] a letter, saying 'In the cathedral, you don't bicycle.' I spoke with Norman Foster and he said it was a pity they didn't do something dignified with the locality.\" For instance? \"They could give it to me. I could invite five or 10 artists and we could do something there, or they could do exhibitions, or use it as a private airport like Le Bourget in Paris.\" What prevents this, says Kiefer, is that Germans don't distinguish between Nazi architecture and Nazi art. \"Nazi art is really horrible, it's boring, but the architecture of the 30s isn't specifically German, it was the architecture of its time. Speer was a bad politician, but he wasn't a bad architect.\" After unification, says Kiefer, Berlin should have been rebuilt along the lines planned out by Speer for Hitler, in the way that Paris wouldn't exist in the way it does without Georges-Eugène Haussmann, commissioned by Napoleon III to modernise the city, \"but in Germany it's difficult – they are afraid of taboos\". He adds that the Berlin wall - \"or part of the wall\" - should have been left intact as a memorial, \"and this empty space between east and west. I believe in empty spaces, they're the most wonderful thing.\"The White Cube show features images of apocalypse and regeneration, of alchemical scales, Stuka-like bombers and sunflowers, heavyweight both literally (Kiefer often works with lead) and figuratively. An artwork was also planned for the outside wall of the gallery, but decided against at the last minute. \"It was too busy there,\" says Kiefer. Not that he worried about it being damaged by the public: \"they can touch it, they can spray on it, I don't care.\" Indeed, his pieces are often weathered by the elements – for instance, a giant, rusty satellite dish protrudes out of one painting. Kiefer says that the current turmoil in Europe influences his thinking and the meaning of his work, \"but you cannot see it immediately in the paintings – I am not a daily political artist.\" He approves of Angela Merkel. \"I'm very happy that a woman is in power, I think they are better. We [men] are inferior.\" Merkel, he says, \"doesn't want to be charismatic – she does her job in an old, Prussian way, and that impresses me. She decided to save Europe, and for that I must congratulate her.\" He is fervently pro-European, a theme which he says \"pushes me\". \"On a cultural level, we need Europe,\" he says. \"Germany alone is not good.\" He says that he'd like to see Europe like the USA – \"I would go so far\" – with regions like Île-de-France, Bordeux and north Germany the individual states within it. \"It doesn't mean that you lose any [region's] specific individual charisma. Europe is a big political organisation and then you have all these countries – it's wonderful, no? We need Europe in an aesthetic way and a political way, and Merkel is now on the right way.\" So what of the power station? Kiefer professes himself amused by the fuss that ensued when he announced that he was buying the Mülheim-Kärlich reactor, since \"that's what I do all the time: I buy old factories, I move in I transform them and then I leave them and give them to some collector as I did in Germany and the south of France.\" He denies that the decision to buy the building was influenced by the Fukushima disaster, and says that standing inside the power station's cooling tower was \"overwhelming. It's so wonderful it's like the Pantheon. It will be a challenge for me to do something with it because it's already very good.\" It's all part of his mission to confront the past. \"In Germany, if something is finished, they like to flatten it, bring it down, make the grass grow over it. That's no good. You should keep these old buildings because they played a role and they can teach us something. I'm against the idea of bringing all these power stations down. I said, 'I'll take them all if you want'.\" Anselm Kiefer Il Mistero delle Cattedrali at White Cube 144-152 Bermondsey Street, London SE1 until 26 February 2012"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/01/zapatero-spain-safe-bailout-euro","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Zapatero says Spain safe from bailout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/01/zapatero-spain-safe-bailout-euro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/01/zapatero-spain-safe-bailout-euro","fields":{"headline":"Zapatero says Spain safe from bailout","bodyText":"Spain's beleaguered economy is out of the woods and will not need a Greek or Irish-style bailout despite the risk of contagion from troubled neighbour Portugal, according to its Socialist prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. In an exclusive interview with the partner publications from the Guardian's New Europe project, the continent's most powerful leftwing prime minister insisted that reforms and an austerity programme designed to reverse a runaway deficit were bearing fruit. He refused to be drawn on his own plans, amid rumours that he will announce tomorrow that he will not stand for a third term at elections due early next year. His Socialist party currently trails the opposition conservative People's party by 16 points in opinion polls. The comments, from a prime minister whom Spaniards describe as \"anthropologically optimistic\", came as market pressure on the country's sovereign debt showed signs of relaxing, despite growing problems in both Portugal and Ireland. \"We now have economic growth. The debt risk has stabilised and is out of danger. And now we are close to creating jobs,\" Zapatero said. Zapatero sees no conflict between being a deficit warrior and a socialist, but points to key differences between his cuts package and that of Britain's coalition government. \"There is a deep, deep difference between what our government has done on education during the crisis and what Cameron's government has done,\" he said, pointing to education spending that has risen to 15% of Spain's GDP for the first time. \"The fundamental difference between right and left is the capacity to redistribute spending and remove obstacles to equal opportunities,\" he insisted. \"We haven't reduced spending on health. We've increased spending on unemployment. We've maintained spending on social care of the dependent. Why do we do it? To maintain social cohesion.\" Instead Spain's government had brought down its deficit by, among other things, cutting civil service pay and freezing pensions. Zapatero said that, having met last year's deficit reduction target, Spain would also hit this year's 6% goal. \"Our priority measure is the strict meeting of the deficit target,\" he said. Although he claimed jobs would be created soon, the timid growth that some critics blame precisely on spending cuts has had no impact on a startling 20% unemployment rate. \"My main anguish is about those people who lose benefit payments but have trouble finding work,\" he said. Reforms in the pipeline should bring more flexible collective bargaining, improved competitiveness and a law to limit deficit spending, he said. \"It's true that some reforms mean cuts, but others are simply changes,\" he said. \"No project can call itself leftwing unless it commits to a competitive economy … we are going to renew Spain's economic structure.\" He warned Portugal that if it wanted to escape a bailout it had no option but to adopt the austerity package that its parliament rejected last week, bringing down José Sócrates' Socialist government and triggering a June election. \"Carrying out the Sócrates austerity plan presented to parliament is fundamental,\" Zapatero said. His comments came even before Portugal admitted that its 2010 deficit was €3bn (£2.6bn) higher than originally estimated. Zapatero, speaking before Ireland revealed that it needed a further €24bn to deal with its banks, said he favoured more aid to Greece and Ireland. \"We should be ready to increase the aid if they need it,\" he said. Like most Spanish politicians, he is an avowed pro-European and saw greater economic integration within the EU as an unexpected but welcome side-effect of the crisis. \"Economic integration is being speeded up. That much is clear,\" he said. \"Integration in politics and security is going more slowly, but it will come. It may take five or 10 years, but the process is inevitable.\" He admits that, like everyone else, he would have liked Europe to react faster to the economic crisis. \"But it is obvious that, amongst democratic countries, there is something called a decision-making process,\" he said. \"The Spanish government is lucky because parliament is always very pro-European … but there are other parliaments in Europe that debate every last cent.\" Even the Libya crisis was an example of Europe in action, he said. \"Who brought a historic resolution to the [UN] security council to intervene in Libya? Two European countries: France and Britain,\" he said. \"It is Europe that has taken the lead.\" The man who pulled Spain's troops out of Iraq when first elected in 2004 said the UN resolution was a historic step for human rights. \"It is the first time we have had a resolution based on a responsibility to protect people,\" he said. \"A huge amount of care and restraint is being exercised,\" he said of the campaign. \"We have not had that thing that is so heartrending – and which discredits these operations – which is civilian victims.\" But Zapatero, who has sent aircraft and warships to join the Libya campaign, insisted that military means should not be used to oust Gadaffi. \"The use of arms is for protecting the population,\" he said. \"For regime change we have our political and economic strength.\" Europe's task did not end, there, he insisted. \"The north of Africa and the Mediterranean as a whole are going to look towards the north. They will look to Europe, and Europe must not look away.\" Wind power became Spain's biggest energy source for the first time in March, but events in Japan have not changed Zapatero's policy of using nuclear energy, while refusing to build extra capacity. \"When nuclear power stations come to the end of their lifespan they will be closed,\" he said. \"We don't propose building new power stations and must guarantee the production of alternative sources to cover the closure of every nuclear power station.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/dec/20/wikileaks-cables-bulgarian-nuclear-project","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-20T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"WikiLeaks cables: Bulgarian nuclear project 'dogged by safety concerns'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/20/wikileaks-cables-bulgarian-nuclear-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/20/wikileaks-cables-bulgarian-nuclear-project","fields":{"headline":"WikiLeaks cables: Bulgarian nuclear project 'dogged by safety concerns'","bodyText":"One of Britain's biggest energy suppliers, which wants to build half a dozen nuclear reactors in the UK, helped develop one in Bulgaria which was \"dogged by ongoing serious safety concerns\", according to leaked US diplomatic cables. The German firm RWE, which owns npower and supplies electricity and gas to 6.7 million UK customers, bought a 49% stake in the project in December 2008 and quit as a strategic partner in October 2009. RWE said its decision to pull out of the troubled €7bn reactor project was due to the fact that \"the project's financing could not be finalised within the agreed period\". It said \"safety issues were not a factor\". But its involvement in such an apparently shoddy project, which the cables claimed \"reeked of side deals\" even before RWE bought the 49% stake, could hurt its reputation over safety and cast doubt on its judgment in selecting who to work with on reactor projects. In December 2007, environmental groups including Greenpeace condemned the European commission's approval of the project. Approval came despite the former Bulgarian nuclear regulator publicly calling for it to be blocked on safety grounds the month before. RWE said: \"RWE adheres to very strict safety standards and criteria. For each project RWE is involved in, safety has the highest priority. The reason for RWE to withdraw from the Belene project was that – because of the international economic and financial crisis – financing of the project could not be clarified in due time. RWE has advised our Bulgarian partners to the difficulties of financing already at an early stage.\" The release of the cables comes amid growing safety concerns over an impending global \"nuclear renaissance\" with more than 1,000 reactors expected to be built by 2030, according to the World Nuclear Association. Countries which could turn to nuclear power for the first time include Albania, Bangladesh, Kenya, Venezuela and Syria. In August 2008, RWE's CEO, Jürgen Grossmann, responded to questions about reports of its possible involvement in the over-budget and behind-schedule project: \"It is remarkable, isn't it, that the possible involvement of RWE in the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Belene, Bulgaria, based on state-of-the-art technology is being described as irresponsible.\" The cables claim that despite its due diligence, RWE's confidence had turned to \"buyer's remorse\" within weeks. In the cable, the US ambassador cited local contacts as saying there was a rush to start construction so that the project would keep RWE on board. RWE had reportedly said that it would not provide funding until it sees the \"first concrete poured\", signalling the start of construction. Belene project experts privately expressed \"serious concerns\" that if safety practices continued to be ignored \"it could pose a huge risk\". RWE's partner, the state-owned Bulgarian electricity company, NEC, which held 51% of the project, declined to comment on any of the allegations. RWE was said to be \"in the dark\" on most on-site and technical issues. This was despite a previous cable claiming that the company in February had demanded to review all Belene-related agreements. The same February 2009 cable reported \"RWE worries about the project's lack of transparency and the need to work with Atomstroyexport [the Russian lead contractor]. RWE wants to enforce European business practices\". RWE was reported around that time to be in talks with a number of European energy groups, including Belgium's Electrabel, to offload half its stake but did not find any buyers. \"RWE realises that working with Russian and Bulgarian companies in the energy sector is a 'poisonous combination' for European investment\" the cable added. The cable also reports: \"When Bulgarians talk about the Belene nuclear power plant, they increasingly do so in hushed tones. Issues of delays, financing woes, non-transparent horse-trading and side deals, Russian influence … and the interests of well-connected politicians and energy oligarchs inevitably come up.\" RWE's statement continued: \"RWE's participation in projects guarantees a high degree of ethical business behaviour and openness to concerns of all stakeholders. We ensure that each project is in line with European standards with regard to transparency and information to the public. It is therefore common practice within all our projects that RWE's or a similar code of conduct will be applied. The same has been true for the Belene project for which a code of compliance was developed and should have been implemented; we would have thereby introduced dedicated instruments against corruption. \"We have raised these issues with NEC and the Bulgarian government and they confirmed that this was a shared mutual understanding. RWE has signed a joint venture agreement with NEC in December 2008 after intense pre-assessment of the project. Under the joint venture agreement the companies involved agreed to jointly continue the project development work, and further advance the project. \"The potential joint construction and operation of the new power plant would not have gone ahead until all relevant safety-related, legal, economic and organisational aspects had been settled during this phase.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jun/28/david-cameron-climate-change-leadership","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-28T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Needed: a world leader | David King","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/28/david-cameron-climate-change-leadership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/28/david-cameron-climate-change-leadership","fields":{"headline":"Needed: a world leader","bodyText":"In January 2004 I caused some consternation, particularly in the White House, when I said that global warming was our greatest threat – greater even than global terrorism. My statement prompted George W Bush to call Tony Blair, demanding a gag order be placed on me. I refused to be gagged and that statement, along with others, spurred the UK to develop a leadership role on climate change in the international community. Seven years on – and with global climate talks struggling – that leadership is needed more than ever. I still believe climate change is the pre-eminent threat facing our civilisation, but in 2004 there was considerable apathy. My statement precipitated considerable public and political attention for the scientific analyses demonstrating the probably catastrophic effects of climate change. Action followed. In 2005 Tony Blair hosted the G8 summit at Gleneagles, and the resulting communique was a giant step in raising the international importance of climate change. The UK government led the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, giving it crucial credibility. We declared that Britain would reduce its emissions by 60% – subsequently raised to 80% – by 2050, to demonstrate the seriousness of our intent. The Foreign Office invested heavily in discussions with key governments, and the impact has been remarkable. I delivered more than 250 lectures to parliamentary and public groups around the world between 2004 and 2008. One notable achievement was the work in China, a significant factor in alerting the Chinese government to the serious risks for their economy from unchecked climate change. Since that 2004 statement stark scientific evidence has continued to accumulate. We have released nearly two trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began, and the result is a well-documented rise in air and sea temperatures and in sea levels. The decade to 2010 was again the hottest on record. The need for urgent political action to manage this threat has never been clearer. It is our responsibility to act. So what is the UK coalition government doing? Domestically, my cynicism about pre-election statements on the need for action was squashed with the recent announcement that the UK will cut its CO2 emissions by 50% by 2025, compared with 1990 levels. This is a critical step towards reaching our target of 80% by 2050, and I believe the process of greening our economy will act as a stimulus to economic recovery. With the announcement of the \"green deal\", electricity market reform, a floor to the market price of CO2 and the green investment bank we do have excellent opportunities for the radical transition to a low-carbon economy. In addition we need to fully grasp the nettle of the role that nuclear power must play, and also ensure the £200bn investment needed in our energy infrastructure is spent on equipment fit for the second half of this century, not the first. With this action the UK is again setting the bar high for other countries, and we must use this position in muscular bilateral and multilateral negotiations with other nations. But there has been no statement at all from the government about the need for collective action on this critical issue, and no clarity from the Foreign Office on the need to step up the pressure following the modest achievements of the last round of UN climate talks in Cancún. Will the UK be playing a leading role in the runup to the next UN meeting in Durban in December? There is again a leadership vacuum on this issue, just as there was in the early 2000s. Will David Cameron step up to the plate, please? Prime minister, will you take your credentials as \"the greenest government ever\" into the global arena?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/01/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2009","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-01T10:51:48Z","webTitle":"UK greenhouse gas emissions fall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/01/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2009","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/01/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2009","fields":{"headline":"UK greenhouse gas emissions fall","bodyText":"The UK's greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 8.7% in 2009, the latest available official figures showed today. Carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, dropped by almost a 10th (9.8%) as the impacts of the recession hit electricity and fuel use across the economy. Greenhouse gas emissions fell across all areas, with an 11% reduction in the energy supply sector, an 11.8% fall among businesses, a 36.5% reduction in emissions from industrial processes, 4.2% from transport and 5.8% from homes. The falls were far higher than the previous year, when both CO2 and greenhouse gases as a whole dropped by around 2% - but emissions from households rose by 3%. The figures, released by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said the fall in emissions in 2009, the last year for which data are available, was due to a significant drop in energy consumption by businesses, industry and homes as the recession bit. An increase in the use of nuclear power, instead of coal and natural gas, for electricity generation also led to a reduction in emissions.

That means that not far below our feet is the power to boil unlimited water and generate clean, renewable energy. Is the UK throwing all it can at this extraordinary opportunity? Of course not, who do you think we are? Germans? That contrasts strikingly with the more glamorous sister of deep geothermal energy, nuclear power. Both ultimately tap the heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements. Geothermal plants send water down holes to bring to the surface the heat from natural radioactive decay deep in the mantle. Nuclear power mines the radionucleides, concentrates them, sends them critical and then wonders what to do with the leftover mess - not very elegant by comparison. The coalition government has pledged that nuclear power will receive no taxpayer subsidies. But it can receive financial support by other means which are subsidies in all but name. So what support is there for deep geothermal projects? Nothing. As Tim Smit - founder of the Eden project where one of just two projects in the UK is sited - put it last night at a Renewable Energy Association event in Westminster: \"I'd like the same 'lack of support' the government is giving to nuclear.\" Geothermal energy has been tapped in the UK since Roman times, via the hot springs at Bath and elsewhere. Shallow geothermal projects - such as ground source heat pumps - are slowly growing. But even Decc's own and very conservative estimate is that deep geothermal - a few kilometres down - could provide 10% of the UK's electricity. And how! It runs 24 hours a day, so perfect for baseload. The water circulates in a closed-loop, so it's clean and sustainable. It is virtually zero carbon and the plants have a small surface footprint, so it's pretty nimby-proof. The catch is this: you'd be awfully brave to invest in it right now. Unlike most European nations, there is no licensing system in the UK. So you could sink your test wells at the cost of millions of pounds, find the right spot, then see someone else set up in the next field. There is no feed-in tariff support for electricity from geothermal. And the ROC support scheme is set at 2 ROCs, compared to the equivalent of 4 ROCs in Germany. It's a familiar tale of German succes and British failure. Germany itself lags the leaders, the US and the Philippines, as well as El Salvador, Kenya and Papua New Guinea, but is the fastest growing in the world. It has about 150 projects in planning this year, representing a total investment of €4 billion, says Ryan Law, from Geothermal Engineering, which is developing the UK's other current project near Redruth, Cornwall. In terms of plants, Munich already has 24 alone, for both heating and electricity, he told me, adding that the geothermal potential for both countries is more or less the same. Germany has invested about €10m a year in geothermal research since 2002: the coalition government cut in half the available funds to £1m and there is nothing more in the pipeline. What is the government afraid of? The tiny earthquakes that some geothermal plants have triggered are surely less worrying than piles of nuclear waste, particularly in seismically stable country like the UK. I'll declare an interest: I used to be a geologist and I like geothermal's style. It is simple and proven. And it has all of the advantages of the nuclear power coveted by successive governments, but none of the problems. And while the nuclear industry will benefit handsomely from low-carbon energy incentives, geothermal stands to get next to nothing. If there was ever a time to hold our minister's feet to a renewable fire, this is it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/jan/28/us-politics-barack-obama","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-28T05:50:51Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama commits to climate change bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/28/us-politics-barack-obama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/28/us-politics-barack-obama","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama  commits to climate change bill","bodyText":"Barack Obama put himself firmly behind the effort to get a climate change bill through Congress last night – but said it must include a new generation of nuclear power. The brief passage on energy and climate in Obama's state of the union address did deliver the signal Congress and much of the world had been seeking that the White House is ready to throw itself into the effort to pass legislation. \"This year, I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate,\" he said. But Obama made it clear that he supported a \"bipartisan\" effort which would incorporate energy policies that are popular among Republicans – and fiercely opposed by the liberal wing of his own party. \"That means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies,\" Obama said. The endorsement for nuclear power and especially offshore drilling will be difficult for some Democratic voters to swallow. Most of the instant reaction to the speech from environmental groups was positive – though few commented directly on Obama's support for nuclear power or drilling. However, the Centre for Biological Diversity was scathing. \"A clean energy economy does not include continued reliance on dirty coal and further risky drilling for oil in fragile offshore areas,\" the centre's director, Kieran Suckling said in a statement. \"The president failed tonight, as he failed over the past twelve months, to use his bully pulpit to advocate a bright line goal for greenhouse gas reductions. \" Obama's endorsement of a nuclear renaissance – 30 years since the last new nuclear plant – was calculated to help the efforts of Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Lindsey Graham craft a compromise bill that could get broad support in the Senate. The house narrowly passed a climate change bill last June, but the effort has bogged down in the Senate. The two Senators told reporters earlier Wednesday that they were closely focused on pulling in Republican support, and damping down fears among Democratic senators from oil, coal and heavy manufacturing states that energy reform would hurt local economies. Obama hewed closely to the same strategy, peppering his speech with references to new \"clean energy\" jobs and the \"profitable kind of energy\". He uttered the words \"climate change\" precisely once, referring to America assuming a leadership role in the negotiations to get a global deal to halt warming. But the president did voice support for a \"comprehensive\" Senate bill – code in Washington for a broad set of proposals that would also include establishment of a cap and trade programme. The nod for a \"comprehensive\" bill could help head off attempts to get the Senate to scale back its ambitions, and pass a narrowly focused energy bill that would not attempt to establish a carbon market. And he said he wanted a bill through the Senate in 2010 – timing that is seen as crucial both for the prospects of energy reform in America and for getting a global change deal. Obama also took a shot at climate change deniers, which brought some mutterings from Republicans. \"I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change,\" he said. \"But even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/mar/03/power-uk-decc-carbon-calculator","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-03T11:15:42Z","webTitle":"Pull the levers of power in the UK with Decc's new carbon calculator | Fiona Harvey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/mar/03/power-uk-decc-carbon-calculator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/mar/03/power-uk-decc-carbon-calculator","fields":{"headline":"Pull the levers of power in the UK with Decc's new carbon calculator","bodyText":"You've read the book, now play the game. Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air by David MacKay, professor of physics at Cambridge University, was one of the 2008 cult hits for anyone with an interest in the green future of the planet. For the first time, the book laid out in great detail the options that the UK must choose from if we are to meet our stated goals of cutting emissions by 32% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. The analysis that MacKay provided – a much heavier reliance on nuclear power will be needed, he argued, in order to make up for the intermittency of renewables and the lack of other large-scale alternatives to our current fossil fuel-powered mix – was disputed by some green campaigners, who said he undervalued the input from renewable power. The book was offered for free download on the internet, and following MacKay's appointment as scientific adviser to the UK government's Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) it was widely read as an indicator of how the government's low-carbon planning might progress. Soon after, Decc published a tool by which internet users could make their own choices about how the UK's energy mix might change, and how this might translate into policy choices. (The Guardian also developed a similar tool, offering readers the chance to calculate carbon balances.) Now that initial – rather nerdy – system has been overhauled, with a new user-friendly 2.0 version, Pathways to 2050, released with a whizzy-looking gaming interface, and a view to making it more accessible to those with only a passing knowledge of kilowatt hours, megajoules and carbon intensity values. Players are invited to pull the levers of power in the UK – by choosing how the energy mix should be made up, with options for increasing the proportion of nuclear energy generation, fossil fuel power and renewables of every stripe. It's a game of swings and roundabouts. Choose more offshore wind turbines, for example, and you can turn off some coal-fired plants. Opt for more tidal turbines, and you can ease off on new nukes. Every choice is graphically represented, in an easy to understand format. But all the while the clock is ticking, and if at any point the player's choices get too quixotic – cover an area the size of Wales in wind turbines, would you? – the reality checks are quick to kick in. If ever projected energy demand looks in danger of exceeding supply, a big red banner appears on the top of the screen warning that this state of affairs can't continue for long. The game is an excellent exercise for anyone interested in the UK's energy future – which we all should be. Importantly, it gives a real sense of some of the difficult choices that must be made – for instance, biofuels might seem like a great idea to some, but when you can see graphically how much food-producing land must be sacrificed to their production, then even the most ardent proponent might be inclined to wind down their enthusiasm. The only thing missing from this version is a calculation of the costs associated with the different energy choices, which Adam Vaughan wished for in the first version. That will be included in version 3, scheduled to be out later this year, according to MacKay, who acknowledges that cost is one of the most difficult parameters to include, because of the huge variability in price of different technologies depending on the way in which they are used. \"If I don't have something with the costs in by version 3, I shouldn't be doing this!\" he jokes. But while the game may uncover some of the preferences for a new energy mix among the UK public, the other key question remains unanswered. MacKay has played this new version of the game several times, he tells the Guardian in an interview, but is coy about revealing his resulting choice for how the UK's energy mix should be allocated. In his book, he suggested a strong preference for nuclear power. And in his trials of the game as seen by the Guardian, that same preference shone out – when we interviewed him about the new version, he pressed the nuclear buttons before any other alternative source of power. But while all of the other players of the game will have their results plastered across the web site for all to see, it seems that MacKay's are to be hidden as official secrets. \"It might skew the way people view the game,\" he admits, with a Decc minder on hand. So will we ever be allowed to see the results of MacKay's online trial? As he is the scientific adviser at the heart of the government's approach to the UK's energy future, it would seem an obvious move. But one that would be too inflammatory for ministers just yet, it seems. Maybe in version 3.0."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2011/oct/16/tacita-dean-wilhelm-sasnal-review","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-15T23:05:34Z","webTitle":"Tacita Dean: Film; Wilhelm Sasnal – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/16/tacita-dean-wilhelm-sasnal-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/16/tacita-dean-wilhelm-sasnal-review","fields":{"headline":"Tacita Dean: Film; Wilhelm Sasnal – review","bodyText":"You'd have to be blind not to notice that, from a distance, Tacita Dean's commission for Tate Modern's sepulchral Turbine Hall looks like nothing so much as a vast stained-glass window – and for this reason I fervently hoped it was going to have the same effect on me as Olafur Eliasson's numinous The Weather Project (Eliasson's commission, the fourth in the Unilever series, filled this space in 2003-4 – and oh, how I worshipped it). A flickering, flaming 11-minute silent colour film, Dean's installation, complete with sprocket holes and random filter flashes, was made using a CinemaScope lens turned through 90 degrees, and is projected on to a vertical screen 13 metres high. In other words, its scale alone is enough to cow the visitor, and from 50 paces. Like some hungry peasant suddenly confronted with the exquisite manipulations of the medieval architect, your first inclination, as the eyes adjust, is simply to believe. But this faith is misplaced, and fleeting: illusion not epiphany. Move closer, sit down and watch, and the jaw clamps shut again, awe turning first to disappointment, then to irritation. I have no argument with Dean's guiding impulse; her piece is intended to mourn and to celebrate celluloid at a time when 16mm film is no longer even printed in the UK. But I am amazed that it didn't lead her to produce something more interesting and beautiful than this. Film, with its assorted images of escalators, toadstools and a snail lurking on a leaf, isn't just banal (do I need to point out that when it comes to the passage of time, these metaphors have all been used a thousand times before?), it is fatally boring. Ripe tomatoes, mullioned windows, a tree, an egg, a clock... only because I wrote these things in my notebook do I remember them at all. In a commentary on the work, Dean states that \"Film is a visual poem\", a remark I thought dubious even before I saw her fountains plash and her lightbulbs glow: likening other art forms to poetry is a cliche, the first and the last refuge of the shallow thinker. Afterwards, though, I thought it fraudulent too. What she has produced, however lovingly, however laboriously (she slices her prints by hand, alone at a Steenbeck cutting table), is more list than poem – and the trouble with lists is that even as they remind you of your obligations, they are so eminently resistible. You might say that Dean's work is all technique and no content. Well, at the Whitechapel Gallery you can see a show where something approaching the opposite is the case. At his worst, Wilhelm Sasnal, the preposterously successful Polish artist, produces canvases that remind me of a certain kind of 70s album cover; his work can feel overly broad, naive, unfinished and hurried (he likes to paint quickly, often finishing a piece in a single day). I can't help but wonder just how good a painter he really is. But he has big things to say about politics, faith and community, and for this reason the Whitechapel's new exhibition of his work is both fascinating and bleak, the weight of 20th-century history bearing down on every wall of every room. It also works – what serendipity – as an interesting pendant to the unbeatable Gerhard Richter retrospective currently at Tate Modern. Sasnal belongs to a different generation from Richter; born in 1972, he is half his age. But both knew life under communism, and both have an unblinking relationship with the Holocaust, a catastrophe they simply will not ignore, not even in the peace of their studios. Sasnal has used the grey palette so often favoured by Richter; he, too, paints from photographs; and he flips easily between the abstract and the figurative, even if not with quite the same facility as his master. It's extraordinary to see. Talk about the anxiety of influence. The show takes in paintings from 1999 until the present day, with the earlier work in two rooms upstairs. I understand why the curator decided to let people see the most recent paintings first; Sasnal's latest work is certainly the more colourful and, perhaps, the more accessible. The hope must be that visitors see Bathers at Asnières (2010), his interpretation of Seurat's painting of the same name, and feel a welcome connection (the copy's cloistered simplicity is a way of reminding his audience that until Sasnal was 17, when Solidarity was re-legalised, travel to London, where Seurat's original hangs, would have been all but impossible). But I prefer the earlier work, which painfully embraces the fact that Kraków, where Sasnal is based, is not only close to Auschwitz, but once had its very own concentration camp (Kraków-Płaszów): the small painting Shoah (A Forest), from 2003, in which three figures are made miniature by the swirls of green (are these leafy branches kindly or malevolent?) all about them; the scenes from Art Spiegelman's Holocaust comic book Maus, which Sasnal painted large scale and without speech bubbles by way of a riposte to those Poles who couldn't deal with its implications (these paintings – bunks seen through wire, a pig in a peaked cap – somehow need no explanation, even if you have not read Spiegelman); and, most of all, a landscape called Kielce (2003), in which briars and brambles are piled high on old snow, like knives, or bodies. Kielce is a Polish city where, in 1946, Polish antisemites attacked Holocaust survivors, killing 42. Sasnal cannot let go of these themes. He wants to pay attention to other crises – more recent subjects include a Palestinian farmer, an Iranian nuclear power plant, and African migrants – but events closer to home haunt him. Downstairs hangs his most recent work, completed this year. It is a landscape: low, green fields surround a sprawling white construction which, the title reveals, is in fact a pigsty.

An official study said there was no \"strategic case\" for investing public money in such a scheme, which could cost more than £30bn, although it said it could be reconsidered as a long-term option. The Department of Energy and Climate Change paved the way for new nuclear power plants at eight sites: Bradwell, Essex; Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Oldbury, South Gloucestershire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Sizewell, Suffolk and Wylfa, Anglesey. The coalition government has already said it will give the go-ahead to companies who want to build new nuclear plants, provided there is no public subsidy involved, despite the Lib Dems' opposition to new nuclear power stations. All the potential new sites are in the vicinity of existing nuclear power plants. Three other proposed sites – at Dungeness in Kent, and Braystones and Kirksanton in Cumbria – were ruled out. The sites were announced as part of a package aimed at providing certainty for the industry, including more detail on what would be required in terms of clean-up and the government's policy of no subsidies. The energy secretary, Chris Huhne, said: \"I'm fed up with the stand-off between advocates of renewables and of nuclear which means we have neither. \"We urgently need investment in new and diverse energy sources to power the UK. \"We'll need renewables, new nuclear, fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, and the cables to hook them all up to the grid as a large slice of our current generating capacity shuts down.\" The coalition's revised draft national policy statements on energy show that half the new energy capacity built in the UK by 2025 was expected to come from renewables – the majority of which is likely to be wind energy. But the government dropped plans for large-scale tidal schemes in the Severn estuary, after considering five proposals for three barrages and two \"innovative\" lagoon-type energy projects to harness the power of the tides. The most high-profile of the proposed schemes was the 10-mile wide Cardiff-Weston barrage, the costs of which were originally estimated at £15bn but which have now spiralled to more than £30bn, according to the feasibility study published today. The barrage, which would have harnessed the massive tidal range of the estuary to produce green power, could have met 5% of the UK's electricity needs, but was controversial with some environmentalists because it could destroy thousands of hectares of habitat. Conservation groups have been fighting the proposals which they believe could destroy the winter feeding grounds of 65,000 birds. The barrage could also have economic impacts on the area, both positive in creating jobs for the area, and negative in damaging access to the Severn's ports and disrupting recreation such as angling. The report published today found that the costs of a tidal power scheme would be \"excessive\" in comparison to other forms of low-carbon electricity generation. It said a large-scale energy project in the Severn estuary would be costly to deliver and very difficult to finance from the private sector alone, although it did say it should not be ruled out in the longer term as a future option if market conditions changed. The government said it believed other options, including wind energy and nuclear power, represented a better deal for taxpayers and energy consumers. And while it acknowledged the feasibility of a Severn barrage could change over time, and there was potential for a future review of the situation, there were no plans to do so before 2015. Huhne said: \"The study clearly shows that there is no strategic case at this time for public funding of a scheme to generate energy in the Severn estuary. Other low-carbon options represent a better deal for taxpayers and consumers. \"However, with a rich natural marine energy resource, world-leading tidal energy companies and universities, and the creation of the innovative Wave Hub facility, the area can play a key role in supporting the UK's renewable energy future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jan/31/invention-deficit-engineering-exports-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-31T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Innovation: Britain's other deficit | James Dyson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/31/invention-deficit-engineering-exports-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/31/invention-deficit-engineering-exports-growth","fields":{"headline":"Innovation: Britain's other deficit","bodyText":"In his state of the union address, President Obama declared: \"In America, innovation doesn't just change our lives. It's how we make a living.\" This may seem like political rhetoric to some people, but I wish this philosophy was shared by the British government. For me, the UK economy shouldn't be built entirely on the City of London or the next digital fad. We need substance – patentable exports. They bring new money into our coffers. And what will generate economic growth is not just talk of spending cuts, but creating the right environment for research and invention. Investing in the new and unproven is a risk; I found that out myself, having launched new technology during one of the worst recessions. Eighteen years on, we're thriving – last year we were the second highest filer of patents in the UK after Rolls-Royce. But the problem is that we are struggling to fill 300 engineering vacancies. The government's plans to develop a \"silicon roundabout\" in Shoreditch, east London, are seductive for the likes of Google and Facebook, but should not be at the expense of real industry that encourages R&amp;D – research and development – and tangible products. Such a policy lacks balance. A high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham is said to be creating around 30,000 jobs. But it will run German or Japanese locomotives. How many more jobs could have been created had we developed the technology ourselves? While Britain pontificated on the merits of nuclear power, the French just got on with it, and in doing so developed an expertise to export around the world. Our new nuclear power stations are designed by French engineers. And run by EDF. Obama's plans for corporate tax cuts and increased R&amp;D investments are the right way to go. It is what we should be trying to achieve in Britian. The coalition has succeeded in making people realise that we can't keep spending. It has put measures in place and will be judged on its success. But last week the outgoing CBI director-general Richard Lambert pointed to the incoherent strategy. We need a government with a strong vision for the future; with policies that aren't eclipsed by the current financial black hole; and an agenda for growth that isn't short-sighted, but based on exports. Britain has been a world leader in technology in the past. It can be again. Our space industry is flourishing and contributing £6bn to the economy. But at this time we need to keep our feet on the ground and back hard engineering, like Rolls-Royce with its plans for the next electric vehicle – things we can make and export now. The challenge Obama speaks of – finding the next \"big idea\" – is a global race. We too are at risk of being out-innovated by the far east. The challenge is twofold. Countries such as China and India export more than us – the UK makes up just 1% of China's imports. And they are producing more engineering graduates than ever. With sufficient foresight, the government can help businesses develop more reasons to explore and discover, whether by setting a competitive corporation tax rate or incentivising research through a self-financing R&amp;D tax credit. And, as JCB is demonstrating with its upcoming engineering academies, businesses need the best people to make discoveries. While the right environment for companies helps, developing talent is a long-term endeavour that needs to start now. High quality teachers inspire young people to become creative problem solvers, and to be excited about nurturing their innate skills – taking things apart, seeing how they work, putting them back together. Hands and brains can offer us pole position in engineering, creating and exporting. The government is right to take measures to cut the deficit: it's essential for putting the economy back on track. But it needs to demonstrate an ambition to help business grow and nurture talented young minds, which are imperative for the economy to thrive once again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/oct/31/uk-stop-building-windfarms-renewable-targets","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-31T12:35:00Z","webTitle":"Can the UK stop building windfarms and hit renewable targets? | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/31/uk-stop-building-windfarms-renewable-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/31/uk-stop-building-windfarms-renewable-targets","fields":{"headline":"Can the UK stop building windfarms and hit renewable targets?","bodyText":"At the start of this discussion, I listed four questions. Having looked at the evidence, I think I'd now answer them as follows: • Should the UK really be stopping building onshore windfarms after those in the system are built? That depends. Assuming you accept the UK's carbon targets, it would only make sense to stop building onshore wind if: (a) we're confident that the rest of our carbon cutting plans are on track and (b) we're more worried about the visual impact of turbines than rising energy bills. Neither of these conditions currently apply in my view, though (b) in particular is a subjective matter. • How does Decc's 13GW onshore wind target fit with the UK's overall 2020 target for renewable energy? The 13GW figure is a projection, not a target. If we exceed it, we'll cut ourselves more slack in other areas, which can't be a bad thing. • How does the 13GW target fit with the UK's carbon targets? Figures from the CCC suggest that we should be able to meet our carbon targets if we slightly exceed the 13GW projection – which we look set to do. That's encouraging, though whether it's enough will depend on the rest of our carbon cutting progress – and as CCC has often pointed out, it's not clear from the underlying trends that we're currently on track in most areas. • What does opting in or out of new onshore wind mean for future energy bills? It's almost certain that our energy bills are going to go up in the coming decade – both due to rising fossil fuel prices and the need to cut carbon. Of the mature low-carbon energy sources, however, onshore wind is the cheapest, which implies that the more turbines we build on land, the less we'll need to spend overall. That wraps up the discussion. Thanks to everyone who has been in touch with comments, contributions and suggestions. More on the energy bills question, the chart below from the Committee on Climate Change shows a breakdown of the predicted increase in energy bills between 2010 and 2020. Sorry it's so small – you can see the full version on page 17 of this PDF. In CCC predictions subsidies to all forms of renewables and carbon capture and storage technologies will add around 2p to the typical unit of power by 2020 – a bit more than the 1.5p expected increase expected from increasing wholesale energy prices, mainly driven by the rising cost of gas. Of course, either or both predictions could turn out to be overly pessimistic or optimistic. From a financial perspective, you can read this either way: a demonstration that subsidies to wind and other green technologies are driving up bills, or proof that in a world with rising fossil fuel prices it makes sense to invest in carbon cutting now in order to avoid being overly locked into gas, coal and oil generation. Ultimately, though, a purely financial analysis is academic as we're also seeking to reduce carbon emissions. So unless you reject the country's carbon targets (which many do of course, especially on the Tory right), the real question is what is the least expensive way to keep the lights on while also meeting our carbon budgets. That too is a complex question. Economists such as Dieter Helm have argued that the correct path is simply to set a high carbon tax and see which technologies step up. But others such as Rob Gross of Imperial College London disagree, arguing that renewables need and deserve targeted support. Another point that often crops up in the onshore wind debate is the question of whether the turbines actually reduce carbon emissions as promised. Critics of wind energy argue that the results are poor because gas plants need to be kept running on \"standby\" in case the wind stops blowing. This claim was repeated today by Tory MP Chris Heaton Harris, who told the Daily Mail that: [Mr Hayes’s remarks are] a huge step forward. These awful turbines do nothing for the environment – they barely reduce CO2 – they force up energy bills and put more people into fuel poverty. However, this argument appears to be inconsistent with the evidence according to a recent piece of analysis carried out by low-carbon energy advocates Chris Goodall and Mark Lynas. Looking at real-world data on wind speeds and power generation, they found that: From analysing National Grid data of more than 4,000 half-hour periods over the last three months, a strong correlation between windiness and a reduction in gas-fired generation becomes clear. The exchange rate is about one for one: a megawatt hour of wind typically meant the UK grid used one less megawatt hour of gas-derived electricity. This means that actual CO2 savings can be calculated from the data with a high degree of accuracy – these are not guesstimates from models, but observations of real-world data. This is shown in the graph below, which plots generation from wind and gas over three consecutive days in September. The full blog post is worth a read. I want to look next at the cost of onshore wind energy. Our background guide from a few weeks concluded that: Onshore wind has the advantage of being one of the most affordable renewable energy sources. Generating electricity from onshore wind turbines typically costs around 7–9p per kWh, which is around half the cost of offshore wind and a quarter of the costs of solar photovoltaic panels. It is also slightly cheaper, on average, than nuclear power. Onshore wind generation is still slightly more expensive than fossil fuels (generating electricity from gas power plants currently costs between 4.1 and 7.5 p/kWh), but its price is expected to fall in the coming years. The implication is that if we're to stick with our carbon targets but have less onshore wind, then energy bills will rise. This is emphasised by two statements just in from leading UK energy experts. Professor Philip Heptonstall of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and Imperial College London: “The evidence shows that onshore wind in the UK is amongst the lowest cost per unit of electricity produced from the available suite of low carbon power generation options. It follows that preventing the construction of appropriately sited onshore wind farms will make consumers’ bills higher than they would otherwise be.” Professor Michael Grubb, Chair of Energy and Climate Policy at Cambridge University, agrees: “Onshore wind turbines must be carefully and properly sited. But this intervention is nonsensical. At a time of wrenching fuel bills, serious questions need to be asked about why Junior Minister John Hayes is unilaterally advocating a policy to try and block one of our cheapest renewable energy resources and thus drive up everyone’s energy bills.” Here's a map we made earlier this year showing wind farms across the UK at various stages of the planning process. Whether or not this counts as Britain being \"peppered\" with turbines, as Hayes provocatively argued, is ultimately a value judgement. Lots of people seem to think there are now too many turbines – from Tory MPs, 100 of whom wrote to David Cameron calling on him to stop the roll out of onshore wind, to James Lovelock, who once wrote in the Guardian about the curse of \"industrial-scale wind energy stations … to call them windfarms is disingenuous.\" But some comments from the thread below argue that the phrase \"peppered\" is a big exaggeration. @onthefence writes: The 13GW onshore wind target corresponds to about 6,000 wind turbines (onshore turbines are typically about 2MW each). That averages out at one per 14 square miles. By way of comparison, there are 88,000 electricity pylons in the UK. How on earth do you get to the view that 6000 turbines across the whole UK is an intolerable blot on the landscape? @capitalistsockpuppet says: (based on a similar and probably more up-to-date map on the Telegraph site) Zoom in and take a look at your county – mine is Gloucestershire. We have one turbine (small one) in the entire county. Herefordshire and Worcestershire to the north have none. Bristol to the south has three (turbines in one place at industrial Bristol Port, not separate wind farms). Wiltshire = 1 wind farm, Somerset = 1 turbine, Dorset has none. So within an hour and half's drive in any direction, you could see no more than 3 wind turbines if you were looking – which you could hardly call taking over the countryside. And yes, windy and more sparsely populated regions such as Cornwall, Scotland and Anglia do have more than this, for precisely that reason. There are more in the planning system – but with two-thirds to three-quarters of these being routinely turned down (and almost unanimously in the Tory shires), it's hardly an invasion is it? Unless it's dogma and vested interests driving the wind farm hysteria, rather than the actual facts? RenewableUK have sent me their thoughts on the questions posed at the start of this discussion: As DECC have said forcefully today there are no caps on any technologies, just scenarios. As one of the lowest cost mass deployable low carbon technologies, onshore wind has a key role to play going forward, both in meeting our carbon targets and enhancing energy security. One of the key ways to reduce costs in all technologies is policy certainty and I hope we will see more of this going forward with the Energy Bill. Here are a few recent Guardian background guides from our Ultimate Change Change FAQ that may be useful for anyone wanting some broader context on the issues in the wind debate: • How well is the UK doing in cutting its emissions? • Onshore wind energy: what are the pros and cons? • Are solar, wind and marine power too intermittent to be useful? A few people have tweeted to ask about the role of onshore wind in meeting the UK's legally binding carbon targets – including the long-term goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050, relatively to 1990 levels. Perhaps we need more onshore wind to meet these, even if it won't necessarily be needed for the 2020 renewable energy target? I've asked the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) if they want to make a comment on this question and hope to hear back from them soon. In the meantime here's a graph showing the anticipated increase in onshore wind capacity in a sample energy scenario from the CCC. (You can see the whole power mix in an interactive chart on my recent blogpost on the dash-for-gas.) This chart suggests that in CCC analysis roughly 14GW of onshore wind in 2020 is compatible with meeting the UK's carbon targets. By those terms Hayes is correct, though it's not clear that the rest of the economy is on-track to stay within its carbon budgets, in which case perhaps we'll need more wind power after all. The government believes the UK is on track to hit its carbon targets but but interventions from the CCC over the years have suggested that many of the cuts achieved so far are not the result of climate change policies and that underlying progress isn't fast enough. For example, in their 3rd Progress Report, the CCC stated last year that: \"The pace of underlying emissions reductions achieved in 2010 would, if continued, be insufficient to meet the second and third carbon budgets. In addition, it is not clear whether this rate of progress could be sustained under current policies […] Therefore a step change in the pace of underlying emissions reductions is still required to meet the currently legislated budgets.\" Thanks to @carbonbrief who just tweeted me to flag up their analysis of the situation, which is well worth a read. They highlight the point I was going to make next – that the government's 13GW figure for onshore wind isn't actually a target, just a projection. The target is 15% of energy being generated from renewable sources by 2020 – which the government hopes to hit by generating 30% of electricity from renewables. The more onshore wind we build, the less we'll need to achieve on other fronts, such as marine, solar and biomass. And since wind power is the cheapest large-scale source of renewable power, exceeding the projection has the capacity to save the country money. Ed Davey made this same point in his clarification earlier: There are no targets - or caps - for individual renewable technologies such as onshore wind. Nor are there reviews being done of onshore wind on the basis of landscape or property values. What we’re currently consulting on are ways of making sure local communities feel the benefit of hosting wind farms, and whether our understanding of future costs is accurate. Onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables, which is why we’ve been able to cut the subsidy. It has an important role to play in our energy future. I'm going to do more digging on the numbers soon, but in the meantime it's perhaps worth clarifying a common point of confusion with energy statistics: the distinction between capacity (the flow of power generated when a wind farm is working flat out) and generation (the number of units of power produced over a month or year). All the figures mentioned at the start of this blog refer to capacity. How much a given level of capacity generates depends on how much the wind blows, which can vary from month to month or year to year. But the government Roadmap (see page 31) estimates the the 13GW (billion watts) of onshore wind capacity it expects to see installed by 2020 will generate around 32TWh (trillion watt hours) per year. Steve Roberts of Oxford University has just been in touch on this subject. He writes that: Having read (rapidly!) the wind farm section of the govt report, it appears to me that it does rather muddy the distinction between installed capacity (which they give in GW) and actual output (which they give in TWhr/yr). The numbers in the report of 4GW installed wind generators giving 7TWhr/yr mean that the actual output is an average of 0.8GW - i.e. 20% of capacity actually delivered – which is pretty good given wind’s variability, but still about the same as a single coal-fired power station. When it comes to “how much wind power do we need to replace capacity loss over the next 5-10 years”, this 5-fold difference between installed capacity (maximum if the wind blew strong all the time) and deliverable capacity (about 20% of that, maybe less given a lot of prime sites are I guess already used) has to be taken into account; and this distinction does seem to be getting lost somewhere along the way. Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the REA (Renewable Energy Association), has issued this statement: We very much welcome that Minister John Hayes recognises renewables have a crucial part to play in the future of the UK energy mix. His personal views on onshore wind farms are well known and we welcome DECC’s clarification [available here] that his views do not signal a change in Government policy. This situation illustrates the need for top level leadership. Ministers' public disagreements on renewable energy policy are damaging to investor confidence. The public would be best served by a cross-party consensus on investment in energy infrastructure. The Coalition really needs to put the national interest ahead of party-politics given the gravity of our energy challenge. The concern that coalition political point scoring is undermining investor confidence is a recurring theme in the UK energy debate at the moment. Haynor continues: It is important to note that communities have benefitted from wind farms in various ways, including significant funds for community based projects relating to education, the environment and energy saving. We look forward to seeing positive and proactive leadership from central Government, with the publication of the Energy Bill, to give industry the confidence to deliver the modern infrastructure we need, and hope to meet with the Minister soon to discuss how renewable energy is not just about reducing carbon but is also crucial for jobs, skills and growth in the economy. Thanks to @david_joffe who just tweeted me a link to the last progress report from the Committee on Climate Change, the government's advisers on climate and related energy issues. Their report says that on current trends the UK will have at least 15GW of onshore wind capacity by 2020, 2GW more than the Decc central estimate. There was a continued flow of projects into the planning system, with 2.3 GW of new projects submitted for approval in 2011. Of the stock of projects awaiting approval, only 1.5 GW were determined, increasing the stock of projects awaiting approval to 8.7 GW at the end of 2011. The majority (64%) of this capacity is in Scotland. This stock of onshore projects (added to those already deployed and in or awaiting construction) would be more than sufficient to deliver the 2020 capacity in our indicator trajectory (i.e. 15 GW) if historic approval rates continue. My colleague Damian Carrington has published a blog looking at some of the issues and political differences behind the story. He writes that Hayes's intervention is \"either a clever but cynical piece of spin or an abandoning of the national interest to placate a noisy minority. It could in fact be both.\" Carrington believes Hayes's aim is to trim wind subsidies but argues this would be a mistake, both in terms of climate change and energy bills: Opinion polls have shown time after time that the public overwhelmingly supports wind power, even when close to their homes. They understand that the real threat to our green and pleasant land comes from climate change and the ever weirder weather it brings: the floods that devastated middle England in 2000 were made three times more likely by global warming. Hayes has also betrayed energy bill payers at a time when bills are soaring so high that the Prime minister felt forced to invent new policy on the hoof. Here are the facts. Clean energy is not optional, either because of legally binding carbon targets or practical energy security concerns, and onshore wind is the cheapest form of low-carbon energy. It costs about the same as gas – without the greenhouse gases. Rejecting onshore wind farms means pushing up homeowners' energy bills … I'll come back to these two topics below. Energy minister John Hayes sparked a huge row in government on Tuesday when he claimed in newspaper interviews that the country is \"peppered\" with onshore windfarms and that \"enough is enough\". More specifically, he claimed that: Even if a minority of [the onshore wind] in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 target [on renewable energy, to provide 15% of UK's energy from renewable sources] But is that true? A quick glance at wind industry statistics shows that: • 5.0GW, or 357 windfarms, of onshore are wind already built • 2.1GW, or 90, are in construction • 3.9GW, or 272, are consented • 7.4GW, or 356, are in planning Which tots up to 18.4GW – far more than the 13GW listed in the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Renewable Energy Roadmap. These figures suggest that only 27% of what's in planning needs to be built to hit targets, implying that Hayes may be correct – especially given that consents for windfarms over the last year are at record highs according to trade body RenewableUK. All this raises lots of questions, including: • Should the UK really be stopping building onshore windfarms after those in the system are built? • How does Decc's 13GW onshore wind target fit with the UK's overall 2020 target for renewable energy? • How does the 13GW target fit with the UK's carbon targets? • What does opting in or out of new onshore wind mean for future energy bills? I'm going to explore these questions below with help from experts and readers.

The number of new wind turbines built this year is down by half on last year. To date, 540MW worth of new turbines, on land and offshore, have been built this year – 200 onshore and 50 offshore turbines. Across the UK last year, 1,192MW of wind capacity was added. The pipeline of new projects has also stagnated – this year, 2,058MW of windfarms were submitted for planning permission, compared with 2,080MW in 2010, and the number approved dropped markedly, from 1,366MW in 2010 to 920MW, according to figures from industry body RenewableUK. This contrasts with the 30GW of new gas-fired power stations that are at planning stage. These will require tens of billions of pounds of investment, coming mostly from the big six energy suppliers. Although gas is cheaper than renewables at present, the cost of renewables is steadily coming down, and over-reliance on gas is one of the key factors behind high energy bills, according to the government. About 60% of rises in the past year have been the result of the higher cost of fuel imports. In 2010, the total investment in renewable energy in the UK fell dramatically, from $11bn (£7bn) to less than $3bn – a drop of about 70%, according to Roland Berger, the consultancy. This year, the investment has recovered somewhat, after about $6bn was invested in offshore wind, but this is still well down on 2009 figures – despite the government's pledges to expand the renewable energy sector, with a target of 18GW of generating capacity to come from offshore wind by 2020. At least £200bn will be needed this decade to transform the UK's energy sector to a low-carbon footing, but there is little sign yet of investment on that scale. Last week construction group Carillion said 4,500 jobs are at risk as a result of a government decision to cut solar energy subsidies. There are 39,000 jobs dependent on the solar energy sector and thousands more are also at risk. Manfred Hader, a partner at Roland Berger, said: \"More regulatory clarity and the making available of large amounts of capital are necessary to drive government targets for offshore wind. There will be a need to bridge the gap between funding via traditional sources such as utilities and banks and the total investment required – it is a moot point as to whether institutional investors would be interested and whether the green investment bank would make a real difference to this issue.\" Wind represents the biggest share of the UK's renewable energy mix, but other forms of renewable energy have also been set back. Solar power companies are set to cut thousands of jobs, as the government abruptly halved the subsidies available for solar panels. The biomass sector has suffered, too, as several proposed new biomass power stations, burning waste, energy crops or straw, have been delayed. Drax, which operates the biggest UK coal-fired power station, has put on hold plans for two new straw-burning biomass plants. While renewables struggle, gas has seen a flurry of interest from the big six suppliers. Over the past few years, plans for at least 30GW of gas-fired power have been brought forward, which would lead to a rash of new power stations across the country, with some now in construction but most still in the planning stages. Gas businesses have also been lobbying heavily to be seen as a \"green\" fuel, because burning gas produces about half the carbon dioxide of burning coal. However, gas lobbyists also have the renewables industry in their sights, as the Guardian has revealed, with behind-the-scenes meetings with key political figures across Europe and the publication of a report which took McKinsey research showing renewables could power a low-carbon Europe and re-interpreted it as an argument that opting for gas would be cheaper than pushing renewable energy. Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, invited the construction of new gas-fired power stations with a promise that a new \"emissions performance standard\" would be set at a rate that favoured gas but blocked new coal-fired power. He promised this new regulation would not be reviewed until 2015, and any revision would not be retroactive, giving gas companies a clear window for investment. Huhne's comments made clear one of the reasons behind the government's encouragement of new gas-fired power – that new gas power stations take only about 18 months to build. Ministers are concerned that as many of the older coal-fired power stations are taken out of service in the next few years, there could be an \"energy gap\" between demand for electricity and supply. As putting up new gas-fired power stations is quick compared with wind turbines or nuclear reactors, gas is now the favoured option if ministers fear there is any likelihood of suppliers failing to \"keep the lights on\". Burning gas produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal so switching from coal to gas has helped the UK to one of the most impressive emissions-cutting records of any country over the past 20 years. There were no gas-fired power stations in 1990, but the rapid expansion of the sector driven by the Conservative government, under Margaret Thatcher, was the biggest single factor behind the 25% cut in the UK's greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2010. The government's new carbon plan - published on December 1 - showed a further switch away from the UK's remaining coal-fired power stations, many of which will be taken out of service in the next few years, is a major factor in enabling the government to promised 34% emissions cuts compared with 1990 levels by 2022. Between 40 and 70GW of new capacity will be needed to meet the UK's carbon targets. Huhne said: \"The energy mix will depend on what happens in the world gas markets. If there is a low gas price in the UK, then you will see more gas and carbon capture and storage and less renewable energy and nuclear [power].\" There are risks to a dependence on gas, however. High prices in world markets have been the main cause of energy bill rises and as demand increases this is likely to continue. Huhne has said the UK needs to give up its \"addiction to fossil fuels\" but on current plans gas looks a clear winner from government energy policies, with the outlook for renewables less certain. David Nickols, managing director at the consultancy WSP Future Energy said project finance for major renewables projects looked difficult, and planning restrictions were also \"major obstacle\". Paul Sloman, a partner at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, warned: \"The UK cannot afford to be reliant mainly on gas-fired generation as energy security is also a very pertinent issue and increasing reliance on gas is not the solution, particularly as the UK's own gas production from the North Sea declines.\" • This article was amended on 6 December to change the number of turbines in the second paragraph from 400 to 250."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/27/us-navy-biofuel-gunboat","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-27T19:46:06Z","webTitle":"US navy completes successful test on boat powered by algae","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/us-navy-biofuel-gunboat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/27/us-navy-biofuel-gunboat","fields":{"headline":"US navy completes successful test on boat powered by algae","bodyText":"It looked like a pretty ordinary day on the water at the US naval base in Norfolk, Virginia: a few short bursts of speed, a nice tail wind, some test manoeuvres against an enemy boat. But the 49ft gunboat had algae-based fuel in the tank in a test hailed by the navy yesterday as a milestone in its creation of a new, energy-saving strike force. The experimental boat, intended for use in rivers and marshes and eventually destined for oil installations in the Middle East, operated on a 50/50 mix of algae-based fuel and diesel. \"It ran just fine,\" said Rear Admiral Philip Cullom, who directs the navy's sustainability division. The tests, conducted on Friday, are part of a broader drive within the navy to run 50% of its fleet on a mix of renewable fuels and nuclear power by 2020. The navy currently meets about 16% of its energy and fuel needs from nuclear power, with the rest from conventional sources. The navy plans to roll out its first green strike force, a group of about 10 ships, submarines and planes running on a mix of biofuels and nuclear power, in 2012, with deployment in the field scheduled for 2016. The green trend runs across all military services. The air force has been testing jet engines on a mix of conventional fuels and camelina, a crop similar to flax, and the Marine Corps recently sent a company to Afghanistan's Helmand province equipped with portable solar panels and solar chargers for their radio equipment. Fuels made from algae oil burn more cleanly than fossil fuel, but preventing climate change is not a major factor in the Pentagon's calculations. \"Our programme to go green is about combat capability, first and foremost,\" Cullom said. \"We no longer want to be held hostage by one form of energy such as petroleum.\" Over the last year, the Pentagon has become increasingly vocal about the burden of running oil convoys in battle zones. Fossil fuel is the number one import to US troops in Afghanistan, and the slow and lumbering convoys of oil tankers are an obvious target for enemy combatants. Fossil fuels are also horrendously expensive. By the time it reaches a war zone, the true cost of a gallon of petrol is well over $400. In theory, biofuels can be produced wherever the raw materials are available, possibly even in the combat zone. However, Cullom admitted that, as of today, algae-based fuels are no bargain. The current cost of a gallon of algae-diesel mix is $424 a gallon. \"Any time you are an early adopter, it's not going to be $3 a gallon,\" he said. The early versions of algae-based fuels had a short shelf life, with the fuel separating in the tank, sprouting, or even corroding engines. \"They had some not very good characteristics at the end of the day,\" he admitted. But the navy appears committed. Last month it placed an order for 150,000 gallons of algae-based fuel from a San Francisco firm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/28/uk-switch-low-carbon-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-28T12:34:48Z","webTitle":"UK switch to low-carbon energy 'no dearer than doing nothing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/28/uk-switch-low-carbon-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/28/uk-switch-low-carbon-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK switch to low-carbon energy 'no dearer than doing nothing'","bodyText":"Every person in Britain will need to pay about £5,000 a year between now and 2050 on rebuilding and using the nation's entire energy system, according to government figures. But the cost of developing clean and sustainable electricity, heating and transport will be very similar to replacing today's ageing and polluting power stations, the analysis finds. The forecasts come from a unique open-source analysis package, called the 2050 pathways calculator, which was created by Professor David MacKay, chief scientific adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The predictions challenge suggestions that the costs of embracing low-carbon energy and meeting the UK's legally binding commitments to tackle global warming will be higher than the bill would be for using traditional energy sources. They are also supported by a major EU project that found developing renewable energy was no more expensive than alternatives. \"The calculator takes the poison out of the debate,\" MacKay told the Guardian. \"The key thing is that any scenario you choose has to add up.\" He said the tool, constructed with the help of hundreds of experts and a thorough literature review, is used to enable \"open source policy making\", where anyone can see and challenge the assumptions made and the data used. \"You can play at being secretary of state, and you have to make a plan which is not too unpopular.\" The calculator was used to create the three scenarios set out in the government's official carbon plan, which shows how the UK could meet its emissions targets by 2050 while keeping the lights on, and to test a \"cost-optimised\" scenario, ie the cheapest. Doing almost nothing to develop low-carbon energy systems – and busting the UK's carbon targets – would cost £4,682 a year, spent on imported gas for electricity generation and heating and oil for all vehicles. That is 13% of the expected £35,000 average income over the period. By comparison, the least-cost 2050 scenario is £84 (1.8%) a year less expensive, and envisages a mix of electricity generation comprising 42% renewable energy, 31% nuclear power and 27% gas plants with the carbon captured and stored underground (CCS). It also envisages improvements in energy efficiency, with demand from lighting and appliances having fallen by 60% compared with 2007 levels. However, the cost of the \"do nothing\" option does not include the damage to the economy expected as a result of climate change, and the calculator notes that, according to the landmark Stern review: \"This is the equivalent of up to £6,500 per person per year on average, on top of the cost of the energy system.\" The government's \"higher renewables, more energy efficiency\" scenario, in which wind delivers 55% of the total electricity supply and all cars and buses are fuelled by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, is forecast to cost £368 a year (8%) more than the \"do nothing\" scenario, if climate change damage is ignored. The \"higher CCS, more bioenergy\" scenario is £470 (10%) more than doing nothing, and assumes the successful deployment of CCS technology at commercial scale, as well as being used with sustainable and plentiful biomass supplies to generate \"negative\" emissions. The final scenario, \"higher nuclear, less energy efficiency\", is the most expensive, £499 (11%) more than doing nothing. Some experts argue the analysis cannot take into account key future developments though. Professor Dieter Helm, at Oxford University, is unconvinced that the costs of low-carbon and high-carbon energy scenarios will necessarily prove to be similar. \"This [similarity] is indeed the result you get if you take conventional wisdom on fossil fuel prices and assume no major technical progress. But these are precisely the two assumptions which would make a difference.\" Helm says gas may turn out to be cheap and abundant, but also that technology advances in batteries, the electrification of transport, breathroughs in solar power - such as the harnessing of photosynthesis - and the use of smart grids could cut the costs of low-carbon energy too. \"The calculator is very interesting,\" Helm says. \"My own view is that making detailed cost estimates is a heroic and potentially very misleading exercise.\"The nation's energy use splits roughly into three, MacKay says: transport, heating and electricity. But the biggest costs come from transport, as the \"millions of individual, little power stations driving around\" – cars and lorries – use energy far less efficiently than large power stations. The new version of the calculator is the first to include costs, an essential component, says MacKay: \"You can't have a grown up conversation about this issue without costs.\" He says the tool is now being used as the basis for equivalents in China, Portugal and Belgium.MacKay believes the calculator has an essential role to play in assessing the feasibility of different energy choices. He describes the government's current policy of backing multiple technologies as a sensible \"hedge\". Groups from National Grid to Friends of the Earth have already posted their preferred scenarios on the calculator website. As an example, MacKay says: \"An interesting question is what is the trade-off between energy efficiency and building more generation capacity? Do you want really good retrofits of homes, or just build new nuclear plants. In the calculator, people can choose.\" However, he notes that the lowest cost options do involve a very strong effort on increasing energy efficiency and cutting waste, as this is a cheaper overall than building new power stations. Another example, included in the government's Carbon Plan, is \"How could the cost of a pathway change if, say, nuclear costs are high and the cost of, say, renewables are as low as credible experts believe is possible?\" Shale gas, which is currently being explored in Lancashire and has driven prices down in the US, is not explicitly included in the calculator. But can be easily incorporated, says MacKay, by choosing a low gas price in the model. There is a possible \"positive future\" when domestic shale gas cuts prices and CCS is working, he says. MacKay, a professor of physics at Cambridge University, was appointed to government in 2009 shortly after publishing a surprise bestseller book called Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air. \"I was irritated by all the twaddle being talked about energy and the misleading comparisons made. I just wanted the numbers without the hype,\" he said. \"I am just the numbers guy, trying to be helpful.\" From numbers guy to publishing sensation \"I was distressed by the poor quality of the debate surrounding energy. I was also noticing so much greenwash from politicians and big business. I was tired of the debate – the extremism, the nimbyism, the hairshirt.\" That, Prof David MacKay told the Guardian in 2009, was why he wrote a book in his spare time called Sustainable Energy – Without the Hot Air. He published it as a free pdf on his website, from where you can still download copies without charge. Yet this expertly written but amateurishly published book has now sold over 40,000 copies in print and been downloaded about 400,000 times. \"The Guardian made us a star,\" he says. It has also been translated by volunteers into Japanese, German, Spanish, Hungarian, Polish and French. An Australian \"translation\" also exists, which sets the energy questions in a specifically Australian context. Very few areas have needed changes since, he says now: \"The book was mainly about the laws of physics and they have not changed.\" A reanalysis of the land area needed for wind turbines was an exception, after he was accused of being \"anti-wind\" and \"pro-nuclear\", though the numbers changed only a little. He is neither, he said, being \"pro-arithmetic\" instead. MacKay, a physics professor at Cambridge University, says he did not write the book to make money. However, it did land him a job: nine months after the book was published, he was appointed chief scientific adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. • This article was amended on 29th December.

Over the past decade his party has moved closer to the centre, bringing it defeat in two general elections, in 2006 and 2010. But in a speech to an extraordinary party congress in Stockholm on 26 March, Juholt announced that he wanted to restore the core values of Swedish social democracy. Elected after a secret ballot, which has attracted fierce criticism in recent months, Juholt came out with a long list of party ideals, heralding a return to first principles for a party that boasts an exceptional record in Scandinavian politics, having held power for much of the time since the 1930s. He was clearly in favour of market economics but against capitalism. Many observers said that they had not heard the welfare state presented in such terms for more than 25 years. Although he has been the party's deputy secretary general since 2004, Juholt is a relative unknown. During his years on the party executive, he travelled widely and can count on a solid network in other parts of Sweden. The previous SAP leader, Mona Sahlin, spent her career in the capital or its vicinity. A fine orator with a great sense of humour, Juholt combines a knack for off-the-cuff remarks with a reputation as an accomplished schemer. Aged 48, he was born in Oskarshamn, a small town 300km south of Stockholm, best known as the location of one of Sweden's three nuclear power stations. He worked as a journalist on a local paper and went into politics early on. He was first elected as an MP in 1994, soon becoming a defence specialist. Since last year's general election he has chaired the parliamentary defence committee. He advocates transatlantic links between Sweden and the US. His priorities include ending child poverty, cutting youth unemployment, raising public-sector wages, reviewing the pension system if it cannot sustain an acceptable standard of living, and going back on the \"failed\" privatisation of certain markets, in particular electricity and rail transport. All that remains to be done, between now and the general election in 2014, is to explain to voters how he plans to achieve these goals.

Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said the losses – the biggest ever by a Japanese firm outside the financial sector – compared with a profit of 134bn yen the previous year. The firm's beleaguered president, Masataka Shimizu, said on Friday that he would resign to take responsibility for the crisis at the Fukushima plant, now in its third month. Toshio Nishizawa, managing director, will replace him after a shareholders' meeting on 28 June. Shimizu, whose resignation had been expected, did not appear in public for two weeks after the disaster and was later admitted to hospital suffering from fatigue. \"I wanted to take managerial responsibility as a symbolic act of closure,\" said Shimizu, who bowed in apology several times. \"We are doing everything we can to resolve the crisis.\" He defended the decision to appoint a successor from inside the company. \"We put the highest importance on experience and expertise in our business operations when we chose the person for the top post,\" he said. The head of the utility's nuclear division, Sakae Muto, also resigned and its chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, is expected to step down once the reactors have been stabilised. Tepco vowed to bring radiation levels under control and achieve \"cold shutdown\" in four stricken nuclear reactors between October and January next year, a deadline some experts have dismissed as unrealistic. Earlier this week the company revealed that new data indicated that fuel rods in three of the reactors had melted in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan's north-east coast on 11 March, killing an estimated 24,500 people. The plant, located 150 miles north of Tokyo, has spewed radiation into the atmosphere and contaminated seawater and agricultural produce, forcing the evacuation of 80,000 people living nearby. Work to cool the reactors has been hampered by dangerously high radiation levels at the site. Tepco's losses result from the cost the reacting to the crisis and of scrapping four nuclear reactors at Fukushima. It also decided to abandon plans to build two more reactors. The firm faces a compensation bill running into trillions of yen that will hit profits for years to come. Its stock has fallen 83% since the day before the tsunami, wiping 2.9tn yen off its market value. The government last week agreed to set up a special fund using taxpayers' money from which Tepco can draw cash – which it will then have to pay back – to cover damages claims. Some analysts say compensation payouts could top £80bn Tepco's losses exceed the 812bn yen deficit suffered by Japan's biggest telephone utility, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, in 2002. Nishizawa sought to reassure consumers, saying Tepco had no immediate plans to increase electricity charges to help it through the most tumultuous time in its 60-year history. The firm said it would attempt to raise 600bn yen by selling land and other assets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/jul/01/nick-clegg-press-conference-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-01T08:04:00Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg's first new monthly press conference: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jul/01/nick-clegg-press-conference-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/jul/01/nick-clegg-press-conference-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Nick Clegg's first new monthly press conference: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, has signalled a climbdown over one of the most controversial aspects of his plans to cut £220m from legal aid spending.

He was responding to his Labour shadow Liam Byrne, who asked Duncan Smith at work and pensions questions in the Commons if he thought the tax was a success. Duncan Smith replied: It is proving a success because what it is doing is finally drawing a light on to the failure of the last government to sort out the mess that is in social housing, a housing benefits bill that doubled in ten years and is set to rise by another £5 billion. After all, I never hear from you, or from (Labour MPs) about their failure because they left so many people, 250,000, in over-crowded accommodation, and a waiting list that had grown to 1.5 million. Perhaps you would like to tell us whether you are reversing this policy or not. Byrne said the government \"should be taxing mansions not bedrooms\". • The National Housing Federation has said the consequences of the \"bedroom tax\" are worse than expected. • Margaret Hodge, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, has said that it is \"complete madness\" for the government to think it will get the legislation for the HS2 high speed rail project through parliament by 2015.

Gething, the Labour AM for Cardiff South and Penarth, has become deputy minister for tackling poverty. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. If you want to know the cost of the war in Afghanistan, you could read today's report from the Commons defence committee on the Ministry of Defence's main estimates for 2013-14. The short report contains a chart showing the amount set aside for Afghanistan this year is £2.7bn, which is £400m less than was allocated in 2012-13. Alternatively, you would do much better reading Investment in Blood by Frank Ledwidge, an outstanding book that sets out to analyse the financial and human cost of the Afghan war. Ledwidge is a former naval reserve intelligence officer who has worked in Afghanistan as consultant and his book is clear-headed, methodical, thoroughly-researched - and ultimately rather damning. As Richard Norton-Taylor explained in a recent Guardian story, Ledwidge says the war has cost Britain at least £37bn. And has it been worth it? Ledwidge doesn't think so. Here's an extract from his book. Almost none of the government 'narrative' of Afghanistan again being a potential haven for terrorists is true. Afghans have no interest in fomenting trouble abroad. A former NATO spokesman in Afghanistan, employed (as he put it) to 'put lipstick on a pig', summarised matters thus: \"[The Taliban] pose no threat to Britain and not one Afghan has ever been involved in any terror attack in Europe or the US. It is simply rubbish to assert that British soldiers are fighting impoverished opium farmers and low-grade US$10 a day gun-for-hire insurgents in Helmand province to protect the British people from terror attacks. These Afghans are fighting our soldiers because they just don't like foreigners and infidels. They never have and never will.\" I'd recommend the book strongly. And while I'm on the subject of Afghanistan, I've been looking for a chance to post this, an extract from an interview with the former cabinet secretary Lord Wilson (pdf) posted on the Cabinet Secretaries website. Wilson was asked what advice he would give to a future prime minister. Oh goodness! I mean one always remembers Mr Macmillan’s advice to his future prime ministers, his successors, his advice was, ‘never invade Afghanistan!' And I think that was quite a good bit of advice. More MPs have been talking about the suggestion that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is going to recommend a hefty increase. Here's what they've been saying. The Conservative Sarah Wollaston is about the only person I have seen who has come close to defending what Ipsa is reportedly planning to say. From the Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston I mean I was very happy to take a £40,000 cut, compared to what I would be earning say as a GP working the hours I’m working now, but the reality is if we want to attract as many people possible [to be MPs] and we want them not to have outside interests, we have to set a rate of pay that an independent body decides is the right rate of pay and it shouldn’t be set by MPs. Frequently, when I go and speak to people in meetings and try and encourage them to try to be MPs, many people say they wouldn’t be prepared to take a pay cut to apply to be an MP and I think that’s the point. At the moment, we risk parliament becoming the preserve of people who are independently wealthy, people who can carry on with highly paid directorships and outside earnings, and it would cut it off to a group of people who perhaps do fear that if they leave their current profession, they would then not be able to be able to get back into [it] over a five-year period. From Vince Cable, the business secretary Let’s wait and see what the report [from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority] says and let’s see how MPs react to it – it’s not my job to tell them how to behave. But I think everybody will understand the wider context and the attitude of the public, which I think will be very hostile if the political class decides to put its own interests first. From the Labour MP John Mann We’re in a recession, and it would be catastrophic for parliament to agree an increase. And the comparators, you know - if I was paid the same as a head teacher in a secondary school it would be a huge increase - but the comparators are irrelevant to today’s situation, which is a recession, and our constituents suffering. This [the proposed pay increase] is a non-starter and it’s not going to happen. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Nick Clegg said Ukip is a party that appeals to people who want \"a better yesterday\". (See 2pm.) Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has hit back. He's issued this statement. Nick Clegg and those who wish to weld us permanently to the failing EU are not just dreaming of the past but living in it. The deputy prime minister seems to think that ensuring that the UK remains entangled in the only global region that is diminishing in terms of trade and influence is a way of the future. His ideas, and the ideas of the European political elite that he so well represents, are those of the 1950s and 60s, whereas Britain must be looking for global opportunities to be fit for the next 50 years. The future lies with those who can reform fast and react to a changing world. The European Union is an economic dinosaur surrounded by a world of mammals. Its time has past. The future is where we can aspire to work in the national interest, on behalf of all our people, with self-government and self-respect ... [Clegg] has the temerity to suggest he “totally understands” why people vote for Ukip. He doesn’t even understand why the euro is bad for Britain, was bad for Britain and continues to be bad for Britain. The idea that he understands what makes ordinary Ukip supporters tick shows how disconnected he is from them. • Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, has joined the growing band of MPs pledging not to take any pay rise if one is offered by the independent pay body. He said: \"The public would find it impossible to understand if they took a pay rise.\" He made the statement at a press conference lasting almost an hour, the first in what will become a series of regular monthly press conferences he intends to starting holding. (See 2pm.) • An intelligence and security committee hearing, with the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ giving evidence in public, has been postponed. It was due to take place on Thursday, but will now not happen until the autumn. The news emerged after Clegg cited Thursday's hearing as evidence of how the intelligence services were becoming more accountable. • Vince Cable has dismissed calls for an \"in-out\" referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union as a \"serious distraction\". • David Cameron has said the EU should extend its membership deeper into the former Soviet Union, calling for its borders to run from the Atlantic to the Urals. • Kazakhstan's autocratic leader Nursultan Nazarbayev has said that he would vote for David Cameron in a UK election. • Mark Carney started his first day as governor of the Bank of England with an old London ritual – a trip to work on the Central line. • The Department for Education has said that all schools in England will be given the power to set their own term dates. The proposal is included in the draft deregulation published today. It will affect the 30% of secondary schools and 70% of primary schools that do not already have the power to set their own term dates. • John Mills, the Labour donor has accused people who have criticised his tax-efficient donation to the Labour party of being hypocrites. Here, as promised, but a bit later than I would have liked, are the highlights from Nick Clegg's press conference. We were led to believe from the remarks released in advance overnight that Clegg would be concentrating his fire on Labour. In fact he seemed to spend more time slagging off his coalition colleagues. At least twice he described a Conservative position as one that he could not understand (on Europe and a tax break for marriage - see below). Yet Clegg also said that he could understand the appeal of Ukip. So, if you were minded to cause trouble, there's the headline: Clegg finds David Cameron less rational than Nigel Farage. But read what he said for yourself. Here are the main points. Spying • Clegg said there was \"palpable disquiet\" among European Union leaders about the revelations about the US spying on the EU. He said he encountered this last night when he attended an event in Zagreb to mark Croatia joining the EU. But he said he did not want to provide a commentary on intelligence. • He claimed that the checks and balances applying to the British intelligence agencies were \"second to none\". I have checked myself that the checks and balances, the legislative oversight, is there. We have, in my view, some of the most robust checks and balances, if not the most robust checks and balances, of any jurisdiction that I am aware of. • He said the powers of the intelligence and security committee to oversee the intelligence agencies had been beefed up and that it would be taking evidence from the intelligence agencies in public. But he said the hearing would take place on Thursday. In fact it later emerged that this session has been postponed (the curse of Clegg?) and that the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ will not now be giving evidence to the ISC in public until September at the earliest (which rather undermines Clegg's point about how good the new accountability arrangements are). Tax break for marriage • He said the Conservative party's plan to create a tax break for married couples was irrational and unfair. I have never understood the virtue of a policy that basically says to people who are not married: ‘You will pay more tax than people who are married, or, more particularly, are married according to the particular definition of marriage held by the Conservative party'... For reasons that I have never quite understood, the Conservatives want to basically say to a widow: 'You are not going to benefit from a tax break even though you were married and you lost your husband.' A woman who has been abandoned by her husband suddenly doesn't get the tax break even though she believes in marriage. This desire of the Conservative Party to hand-pick couples through the tax system who conform to their image of how you should conduct your life, I don't think it's fair. And I certainly don't think it's fair on all those other people who are going to have to pay higher taxes to fund this proposal. If money was available for a tax break for marriage, Clegg said he would much rather spend the money on tax breaks for childcare. But he also indicated that the Lib Dems would not try to bock the proposal. The coalition agreement said they would abstain, and Clegg said he treated the coalition agreement \"akin to a tablet of stone\". MPs' pay • He said that, if the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority were to recommend a large pay increase for MPs, the public would find it \"impossible\" to understand. It’s not for any government or party leader to try and second guess them [Ipsa] – they are entirely independent, that’s set out in statute. But my own view is the public would find it impossible to understand, particularly those millions of people in the public sector whose pay is only increasing by 1%, they’d find it impossible to understand that their parliamentary representatives at a time like this would be receiving far in excess of that 1% increase. • He said that it would be for individual MPs to decide whether or not to accept a large pay increase if Ipsa recommended one. • He said that he personally would not accept a large pay rise. Speaking for myself I would certainly seek to do whatever I can to make sure that either this decision is not taken in the first place - but that's out of my hands - but, secondly, if it were to be taken, not to take that pay increase. He said that in the past he had returned money to the taxpayer. He did that when he sold his second home in his constituency. The profit was returned to the taxpayer, he said. Europe • He said the Lib Dems would not support the Tory private member's bill calling for an in-out referendum on Europe. The Lib Dems had been consistent, he claimed, backing the coalition legislation saying there should be a referendum if new powers are transferred to Brussels. But the Tories had changed. We did [the referendum lock legislation] with the Conservatives who, at the time, strongly advocated that that was the best approach. And I can confirm today that when that trigger is set off by a new treaty, we remain of the view - a view we have had for years - that the question on the ballot paper should be an in-out question. The Liberal Democrats have been consistent throughout; the Conservatives have changed. They now want to pluck a slightly arbitrary date in the diary out of thin air to have a referendum on a very ill-defined process of so-called renegotiation. We have a clear position. It is consistent, it has remained the same over some period of time. We are not going to waste any of our time helping the Conservatives indulge in their own internal feuds on the floor of the House of Commons on Friday. The Lib Dem policy was a \"centre-ground position that I think most reasonable people understand\", he said. In a referendum, the Lib Dems would always want Britain to stay in the European Union, he added. • He said he could not understand why the Conservatives were threatening to leave the EU. I have never understood the recently-altered Conservative position which is that they are threatening to leave the European Union if they do not get [what they want]. Jobseeker's allowance • He said making claimants wait seven days before being able to get jobseeker's allowance should be seen alongside the introduction of universal credit. Under universal credit claimants will get their money retrospectively, at the end of the month. Under the current system, when they first claim, they will get JSA for the previous three and a half weeks (because claimants already have to wait three days before being eligible for money). Under the new proposal, they will get JSA for the previous three weeks. • He said the seven-day JSA delay was not a cut. \"It is not a cut. Far from it,\" he said. That was because the money saved would be reinvested in getting people into work. Trident • He said it was wrong to suggest that there was no alternative to replacing Trident with a like-for-like deterrent. He said Danny Alexander had completed his report on alternative versions of the nuclear deterrent and that it was \"a very, very thorough piece of work\". An unclassified version of the report would be published \"as soon as possible\", he said. Bedroom tax • Clegg said he accepted that introducing the bedroom tax was causing some hardship. It was \"sensible\" to ensure that people in social housing did not benefit from something [the \"spare room subsidy\", as David Cameron calls it] not available to people in private housing, Clegg said. What I accept is that when you move from the way it is now to a more sensible system that you might get families who might get caught out. That is why the government was providing councils with £150m to help them, he said. Single growth fund • He rejected claims that the government's decision to put just £2bn a year into the new single growth fund meant that Lord Heseltine's proposals were being rejected. I was talking to Michael Heseltine about that on the day of the spending review. He also accepts that this is the start of a process. If you think that extracting £2bn from the clammy hands of Whitehall departments is an easy process, it's not ... It's a start, a very significant start. Immigration • He said that he did not agree with Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi's call for an amnesty for illegal immigrants. The Lib Dems used to be in favour of such a policy, but they recently dropped the idea, he said. That was because the government had made a lot of progress closing loopholes in the immigration system. Ukip • Clegg said that he could understand the appeal of Ukip even though he did not agree with them. Ukip appeals to a constituency which I totally understand, which is that there are people who do not like a lot of what they are seeing in the modern world ... They appeal, and appeal strongly, to people who want a better yesterday, if you see what I mean. I want a better tomorrow. Conservative party • He condemned the list of backbench bills tabled by the Tory MP Peter Bone and others. They were \"loopy ideas\", he said. He said they showed that some in the Conservative party were not interested in the real problems facing Britain, like housing. Tax • Clegg said he was \"totally relaxed\" about the idea of publishing his own tax return. My tax returns are fantastically dull. I have never incurred income that is not already published. But he also said that he would not start publishing his tax returns unilaterally. It was better for ministers to take a collective decision as to what they did, he indicated. Fairness • Clegg rejected claims that last week's spending review was unfair because the Treasury's distributional analysis showed the poorest households are losing more than households in the middle. What is not fair is sticking your head in the sand and saying it is all too difficult ... There is nothing progressive or fair about asking youngsters who are not even out of education to pay for the mistakes of his generation. That would be similar to he and his wife Miriam deciding to leave it up to their children to pay off their credit card debts, he said. Labour • He says he has no idea what Labour's policy on borrowing and debt is now. Scotland • He rejected claims that the UK government was being unremittingly negative about the impact of Scottish independent. \"I think we are being unremittingly open with people about what is at stake,\" he said. Shale gas • He said that he was in favour of drilling for shale gas as long as it was safe and properly regulated. The main problem was likely to come from the increase in lorry traffic that shale drilling would cause, he said. David Ward • He said that the Lib Dem MP David Ward was complying with the undertakings he has given to the party not to express views about Israel in an antisemitic way. Well, it was a waste of time trying to blog the Nick Clegg press conference live. I could not update the blog because I could not get an internet connection. We were in a plush room in Admiralty House with lousy mobile phone connection. And no wi-fi. Good job the people who work there aren't trying to do anything important like run the country ... Still, I've got it all in my notebook and I will post a summary soon. There was no amazing top line, but Clegg took questions for almost an hour and, on many subjects, he was reasonably interesting. More from Kazakhstan. The Press Association has filed this on the presents that David Cameron and Nursultan Nazarbayev exchanged. The prime minister gave the president a set of Links of London commemorative Wimbledon 2013 cufflinks, reflecting Nazarbayev's love of tennis. The president gave Cameron a commemorative coin set and a bound leather book of Kazakh stamps. They dined on a lunch featuring traditional Kazakh dishes, including salmon with goats' cheese, turkey kuyrdak, consomme with vegetable julienne and spinach and cheese cheburek, veal manty with tomato confit and pesto sauce finished off with pistachio, cherry and berry nougat with caramel sauce. I'm off to Admiralty House for the Clegg press conference. I'll post again before it starts at 11am (assuming my internet connection works of course). You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories published yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories, and here's the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. As for the rest of the papers, here are three articles I found particularly interesting. • Tim Montgomerie in the Times (paywall) says HS2 is a dangerous gamble. For David Cameron, HS2 is more than a grand legacy project. It’s about his political commitment to northern England. Putting aside the risk that high-speed connections between Leeds, Manchester and London might drag talent south as much as transfer wealth north (and that the link will do nothing to tackle inequality in Wales, eastern England or the West Country), there might be better and more immediate ways of helping the North. The North doesn’t need economic help in two decades, but now. If the leaders of Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield or Preston had the choice between HS2 or fractions of the HS2 budget to invest in new roads or university facilities in their own backyards, I’m sure they’d choose the latter. Wouldn’t you? Britain is crying out for construction of new homes for first-time buyers, investment in power plants to keep the lights on and the development of high-speed broadband to ensure that we can compete with the rest of the world in digital commerce. Alternatively there’s fracking, GM crops, peaceful use of drones, 3D printing, thorium-based nuclear power, driverless cars, graphene, superlife batteries, MOOC-based (massive open online course ) learning and personalised medicine if our politicians really want to be forward-looking, without placing all of their eggs in the expensive and very likely out-of-date HS2 basket. • Boris Johnson in the Daily Telegraph says Ed Miliband’s problem is not “geekishness or nerdiness”; it is what he thinks. You could, of course, vote for New Labour if you had a social conscience. But you could also vote for New Labour if you had a social conscience and you wanted to get rich. People felt under Blair that Labour was emotionally and psychologically reconciled to the realities of free-market economics. They looked at old Tony, with his zillionaire friends and his love of tennis and his ever-expanding property portfolio — and they thought: this man is not hostile to business. They could see that he was in favour of wealth creation — and the problem with Ed Miliband is that he sends out absolutely no such signal because it is just not part of his political make-up. He can’t help it. He is the product of a world of north London intellectuals and grew up in a household where the words “free market” or “capitalism” were positively terms of abuse. His problem is not any supposed geekishness or nerdiness; his problem is entirely to do with substance, not style. Under Ed Miliband, Labour has offered no explanation whatever of how it would like to inject more dynamism and growth into British capitalism. It has nothing to say about the everyday problems of business, about high tax and regulation; and as the election approaches it will pay an ever bigger price for its failure to offer any improvement in our relations with the EU in the form of a renegotiation, let alone a referendum. • Sarah Neville in the Financial Times (subscription) says that an academic study has concluded that public spending under Labour was not wasted. The study, led by Ruth Lupton, professor of education at the University of Manchester, and John Hills, professor of social policy at the London School of Economics, comes as the prospect of prolonged austerity sparks renewed debate on the impact and sustainability of public expenditure ... Under Labour, public spending went up by 60 per cent and from 39.5 per cent to 47.4 per cent of gross domestic product. However, until the downturn began in 2008, spending levels were “unexceptional by historic UK and international standards and national debt levels were lower than when Labour took office”, say the researchers whose study, Social Policy in a Cold Climate, is part of a long-term project to assess the impact of both Labour’s social policies and, in the run-up to the next general election, those of the coalition. Most of the extra money went on improving services, bringing new hospitals, schools, equipment and ICT, 48,000 extra full time equivalent teachers, 3,500 new children’s centres and more doctors and nurses, the research says. Access and quality in public services improved. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is expected to produce a report soon saying MPs should receive a hefty pay rise. All the main party leaders are opposed to MPs getting a pay rise in the order of 15%, but, as the BBC reports, they may find it hard to block the move. On Sky News just now Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, said that he thought it was important for the overall cost of politics to fall. Earlier Jo Swinson, the business minister, said Ipsa should take into account what is happening to pay in the rest of the public sector before taking a decision. Personally I think the MPs' salary is absolutely adequate. I have no problems whatsoever with my salary. But I also think it's important that MPs should not be setting their own salary. We don't expect nurses or teachers or indeed BBC journalists to set their own salary and I don't see why MPs should either. I hope that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority have looked in detail at all of the relevant issues to put this into context such as the pay restraint which our constituents, particularly those working in the public sector but people working in the private sector too who have not been seeing pay rises, I hope that's context that they have taken into account. In a separate interview, Tim Loughton, the Conservative former children's minister, said he would hand back any pay rise on the scale apparently being proposed by Ipsa. There’s a whole debate as to whether MPs are sufficiently paid compared to other counterparts, but for MPs to be offered £7,000 – or whatever it is, we don’t know the details yet – would be absolutely absurd, and I for one wouldn’t be accepting it now ... It’s not the right time, it sends the wrong message to the rest of the country going through a tough time. The Press Association has filed some more from the Cameron/Nazarbayev press conference. This is what the Kazakh president said when asked about his country's human rights record by British reporters. The journalist that just asked the question probably visits our country for the first time. So perhaps it is pretty normal when someone from your isles, maybe some people see this country as a 'Middle Ages' country, riding camels and horses, so maybe that's natural to have that kind of vision. But you have visited three countries - the three 'Stans: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Kazakhstan - and I hope you can compare the difference between those countries. As for the human rights issues, I believe that Kazakhstan secures the key human rights. We have free elections, we have free political parties in the parliament, we have the opposition. There are 3,000 media outlets including foreign ones. He insisted there was \"no political oppression\" and that the country's aim was for full democracy. Democracy is the outcome, is the aftermath, the final goal, not the beginning. But thank you very much for the recommendations, for the advice, but nobody has a right to instruct us how to live. And this is what Cameron said about raising human rights in his talks with Nazarbayev. In the relationship Britain has with Kazakhstan and the relationship I have with President Nazarbayev nothing is off the agenda. We talked about a full range of subjects and that includes subjects including human rights, issues that we discussed at some length last night. I discussed, for instance, the letter written by Human Rights Watch and the concerns in that letter. I think it is very important that we have a frank dialogue on all of these issues and that is the way it should be. According to the Press Association, deals worth £700m were agreed by British businesses accompanying Cameron on the visit. David Cameron held a Q&amp;A with students in Kazakhstan today. My colleague Nicholas Watt has filed a full story on the event, which saw Cameron saying he would like to be seen as Harry Potter, but conceding that he might be regarded as more of a Voldemort. As Tim Shipman says on Twitter, it was not exactly an \"ask anything you want\" Q&amp;A. Here's what the Press Association has filed about David Cameron's press conference with Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president. David Cameron was given the backing of Kazakhstan's ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev who said he would vote for the Prime Minister. President Nazarbayev, who has been labelled a dictator by critics, won 95% of the vote in Kazakhstan's most recent election. Asked what advice he could give to Cameron ahead of the 2015 general election, the president said: \"Personally I would vote for him.\" The Prime Minister's trade mission to Kazakhstan has been overshadowed by controversy over the country's human rights record. At a joint press conference Cameron said he had raised concerns about human rights with the Kazakh leader. But Nazarbayev insisted the \"key human rights\" were secure in Kazakhstan and added: \"Nobody has a right to instruct us how to live.\" For more on how Nazarbayev managed to secure re-election with 95% of the vote, here's the Human Rights Watch report on Kazakhstan. It is also worth noting that the Sun claims that Cameron has made a gaffe on the visit, although quite why admitting that he had seen Borat should count as a gaffe is something of a mystery. It is not as if he was presenting Nazarbayev with the DVD. I have good news for my readers who are keen fans of Nick Clegg. The deputy prime minister is giving a press conference this morning, and it is going to be the first of what is intended to be a series of regular monthly press conferences. According to words released in advance, Clegg is going to open the press conference by saying that the coalition is “remarkably durable”. Yes, sometimes there are disagreements in government. Our parties come at the world from very different perspectives. But sincere differences on policy substance are a normal and healthy part of any government and on the most important questions this Coalition continues to confound its critics and is proving remarkably durable. I will be covering the press conference in detail. And David Cameron has been holding his own press conference today. He’s in Kazakhstan where, at a joint appearance before journalists, the Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev said that, if he lived in Britain, he would vote for Cameron. I’m not sure that an endorsement from a Soviet-style dictator is something that Cameron really needs for his 2015 election literature, but I suppose it’s better than Nazarbayev saying he wouldn’t vote for Cameron. I will post more details soon. Otherwise, it’s a very patchy day. Here’s the agenda. 11am: Nick Clegg holds a press conference. 12pm: Ministers hold a payday lending summit. Afterwards Jo Swinson, the business minister, Sajid Javid, the Treasury minister, Lord Freud, the welfare minister, Clive Maxwell, the Office of Fair Trading chief executive, and Martin Wheatley, the Financial Conduct Authority chief executive, are holding a Q&amp;A. 2.30pm: Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.15pm: Department for Transport officials give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about HS2, the high speed rail project. At some point today Vince Cable, the business secretary, will also give a speech saying leaving the EU is “neither a good nor a realistic economic option for this country”. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary before 1pm and another in the afternoon.

It really should be put on the record that our iPads mean our staff no longer spend hours photocopying, collating and sending out through the post vast quantities of paper. All the evidence is now electronic and apart from a very few colleagues, who understandably have found it difficult to adapt to new technology, controversially giving select committee members iPads has probably cumulatively saved £1m a year, which is what we can devote to scrutiny instead of to photocopying. It saves an enormous amount of staff time, freeing them up to do more interesting and rewarding work. Given the high quality of staff that we have serving select committees it is absurd so much of their time was spent on this very unproductive work. In a debate on the Commons accounts, he also said the committee members had been given training to help them question witnesses properly. I do commend the training of MPs in the art of cross-examination. We all think we're frightfully good you know until we're confronted by somebody who points out our tics and habits. Would you believe it, it was pointed out to our committee that we all liked talking rather a lot and asking questions that made our points rather than seeking information from our witnesses. And I hope we have improved as a result from the training and we're going to have another away day with training later this month and I really do commend this to other select committee chairs. • Doreen Lawrence has given her maiden speech in the House of Lords. Here's an extract. Experience had taught me that power is often resistant to claims of justice and basic human dignity. Those who demand these rights must be prepared to fight every single day for them as they will come up against [an] establishment more interested in maintaining the status quo than in helping to foster a society where everyone has an equal claim to justice, no matter who they are or what they look like. • Equipping benefit claimants with the digital and financial skills to use the government's new universal credit welfare system is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, unpublished research commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has found. • The HS2 Preparation (paving) Act has received royal assent. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's a short afternoon reading list. • Rafael Behr in the New Statesman tries to define Milibandism. The Conservatives should consider also the possibility that what Miliband says expresses something more substantial than a retreat to the pre-Blair era of Labour politics. Milibandism is not a complete doctrine but it is much more than nostalgia for the kind of high-taxing, spendthrift social democracy that its opponents want it to be. It does not seek to reverse the accommodations that New Labour made with Thatcherism. The times pose a different challenge. Blair was confronting a mismatch between a party that didn’t like the way the economy worked and a public that largely did. Miliband is reaching out to a public that doesn’t like the way the economy works but doubts the capacity of any party to fix it. If it pays off, the reward is a mandate to reshape British politics on terms chosen by the left in a way more profound than Blair and Brown did. It would refute the idea – the New Labour neurosis – that Britain is innately conservative and that egalitarianism must be smuggled past the electorate. No one claims that Miliband hides his agenda. No one should have been surprised that he called himself a socialist one afternoon in Brighton. He has said it all along. Days after winning the Labour leadership, he told the BBC of his plan: “It is my form of socialism which is a more fair, more just, more equal society. And that is the path that I will want to take our party on.” He has been true to his word. He has taken Labour on the journey that he outlined three years ago and brought it within sight of power. Ed Miliband’s toughest challenge now is to turn his ideas into a campaign that persuades enough of the country to abandon its present course and follow him further down that same path. • Gerry Hassan at National Collective says the independence debate has already changed Scotland. For one, independence, once the preserve of the eccentric and a lunatic fringe, has become the mainstream. Whatever the qualifications and shortcomings some have with the SNP version of independence, as an idea it has become normalised. All sorts of Westminster politicians of every persuasion have to pay lip service to it being possible and feasible that Scotland as an independent nation would be viable. It doesn’t matter that this might be a tactical accommodation on the part of some; by constantly saying it the reality on the ground and popular perceptions change. Another is the way that the British state and government is seen in Scotland. Think of the phrase ‘the British state’. In the past even mentioning it marked you as a dangerous left-wing nationalist imbued with the writings of Tom Nairn, Neal Ascherson and others. Now it has entered wider popular usage and behind this lies a shift in how it is understood. The British state has come to be seen increasingly as a problem for Scotland: in how it governs for a small elite and an unrepresentative corner of the UK in a way which harms Scotland’s national interests (along with a majority of the people of the UK). And here is some more Twitter comment on the row. And Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, has said that anyone who wants to get rid of renewable energy measures and energy saving initiatives for the poor (which explain the need for green levies on household energy bills) is \"full of crap\". Here's Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, on the Cameron \"green crap\" controversy. It's very sad that we have a prime minister who doesn't want to insulate the homes of poor pensioners and give them efficient boilers, and help those who can't afford to pay bills driven upwards primarily by our costly gas. Unfortunately that also reflects the quality of our energy policy. It's been left to charities and campaigners to offer alternatives, such as the Energy Bill Revolution - which would take the money from carbon taxes and use it to super-insulate our homes, cutting bills, creating jobs and cutting carbon emissions. Earlier I said Tim Yeo was chair of the Commons environment committee. That's a mistake. He's chair of the energy committee. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has posted some observations on the autumn statement. Here's an excerpt. The monthly data on the public finances since the Budget suggest that the headline deficit is also set to be better than the OBR’s Budget forecast. Central government receipts would need to grow by 2.8% in 2013–14 for the OBR’s forecast to be correct. The data from the first seven months of this financial year suggest that they have in fact grown by 4.6% compared to the same period last year. Receipts from National Insurance contributions, self-assessment income tax, and stamp duty land tax have grown particularly strongly over the last seven months compared to the OBR’s forecast for the year as a whole and easily outweighs a more than £2 billion shortfall in receipts from the Swiss capital tax arrangement. Should central government receipts continue to grow at this rate for the remaining five months of this financial year (which of course they might not), and if the OBR’s forecasts for public spending and for other receipts were to prove accurate (which again they might not), then the deficit this year would be £7 billion lower than the Budget forecast. An error of this magnitude would be impressively small – at least compared to the historical record of the Treasury who, on average, made an absolute error in projecting borrowing one year out of around 1% of national income or £16 billion in today’s terms. Of course even if the deficit forecast for this year is revised down by £7 billion, it would still be £113 billion, which – at 6.9% of national income – would be larger than any UK deficit seen between the end of the Second World War and 2008–09. Furthermore, a deficit of £113 billion in 2013–14, while lower than projected in the March Budget, would still be substantially higher than the £60 billion that Mr Osborne projected for this year at the time of his first Budget in June 2010. • Downing Street has played down - but refused to deny outright - reports saying that David Cameron has told colleagues he wants to \"get rid of all this green crap\". A spokesman said Number 10 did not recognise the phrase and, taking part in a photocall, Cameron insisted that he was still committed to the environmental agenda. Nick Clegg told LBC that the phrase was not \"a fair reflection of [Cameron's] views\". • Labour has accused the Tories and the Lib Dems of trying to \"smear\" the party over its association with Paul Flowers, the disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman. Ed Miliband said that Labour had behaved entirely properly. What this episode says is more about the character of the prime minister than the character of Labour's relationship with the Co-op. We have a prime minister, who when he says a serious situation at a bank tries to make cheap political points rather than sorting out that serious situation, and frankly David Cameron is determined to smear his way to the next 18 months. That's wrong, and that's not what the British people expect from the prime minister. \"As soon as I knew about Reverend Flowers' activities, he was suspended from the Labour party, and now what needs to happen is there does need to be a look at the regulatory issues around the regulation of the Co-op and around Reverend Flowers' role in that. But I think what the British people have a right to expect from the prime minister is not just to engage in smear, unjustified smears, but actually to concentrate on helping the borrowers, the savers, the investors, in this important institution. And Ed Balls said that for Nick Clegg to suggest that Flowers had donated £50,000 to Balls was a lie. To allege and smear that I have received £50,000 from Paul Flowers, it’s a lie, and I hope [Clegg] will withdraw that ... Nick Clegg and George Osborne and David Cameron say I’ve got the questions to answer. They’re the government, they’ve been there for three years, they have advocated Paul Flowers buying 600 Lloyds branches. Were they asleep? Did they not know what was going on? They’re the regulators, they’re in charge and they’ve not been doing their job. Balls also said that he had had never had a meeting with Flowers. You would believe from looking at David Cameron and the Daily Mail that I met him regularly. I've never ever had a meeting with him ever, or an email or a phone call. Mark Hoban, the Treasury minister, has had 30 meetings with him. I've never had a meeting with him. I've been at a dinner he was at, I was at a reception he was at, he was the chair of a bank, but the idea that Ed [Miliband] or I knew what was going on - we weren't the regulator, we weren't the chancellor, we weren't in charge and where were these guys? Why was George Osborne asleep on his watch? • Nick Clegg has hinted at the need for a wider inquiry into the \"unimaginable\" power of spying technology as US whistleblower Edward Snowden's leaks are chipping away at public support for the intelligence agencies. • George Osborne has received a boost as he puts the finishing touches to his autumn statement, as official figures showed stronger tax receipts from the gathering pace of the economic recovery are helping to boost the public finances. • Tim Yeo, the Conservative MP, has been cleared of abusing his position as chair of the Commons energy committee. • Ed Balls has said that Labour would launch the biggest programme of new town construction in decades. He made the commitment in a speech. If we are to meet that target of at least 200,000 new homes a year by the end of the next parliament, while protecting communities, preserving valuable green belt land, avoiding haphazard urban sprawl and encouraging quality housing in sustainable communities , then every community will need to play its part and plan for the next generation. But we are also clear that we cannot deliver this ambition unless we build new towns. Our priority will be to create ways in which a local authority or groups of authorities are incentivised to come forward to identify locations capable of sustaining large scale sites for New Towns and Garden Cities. With the Lyons Commission we will examine whether and how to give new town development corporations the right to: keep increased revenue from business rates as a revenue stream to finance investment - and to use the increased value of land to generate further capital for investment; acquire and assemble land; and plan and develop the infrastructure needed, bringing together the agencies and utilities who will need to participate in that process to deliver it. We should draw on the lessons from the past of how the New Towns were developed after the Second World War by Development Corporations, which had the powers to acquire, own, manage and dispose of land and property; undertake building operation; provide public utilities; and do anything else necessary to develop the New Town. • Carwyn Jones, the first minister of Wales, has warned that the Welsh government would probably try to block plans by Alex Salmond for a new sterling currency union if Scotland voted for independence. • The Local Government Association has said England's communities are being \"short-changed\" by £4.1bn a year under the model used to allocate central government funding across the UK. • Labour council leaders have visited Number 10 to lobby in favour of HS2. • Kris Hopkins, the housing minister, has welcomed figures showing that the last three months have seen fastest rate of housebuilding since the crash in 2008. But Emma Reynolds, his Labour shadow said the number of affordable homes built in England was 26% lower in 2012-13 (42,830) than in 2011-12 (58,100). She said: David Cameron is presiding over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. Home ownership remains out of reach of low and middle-income earners, rents ARE rising faster than wages and waiting lists GROW ever longer. Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, has said that, in the light of the \"green crap\" controversy, the government should now firmly state its commitment to the low carbon agenda. This has gone too far. The public debate around energy policy has gone from fever pitch to farce. Our members are already reporting problems securing investment, and this further undermines confidence. With a capacity crunch looming and firm action on climate change ever more urgent, these investments cannot wait. We need a clear statement from the government – not one party or the other, not one department or the other – but from the government, on its commitment to delivering the low carbon energy infrastructure this country so desperately needs. Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, has posted a blog about the \"green crap\" controversy. Here's an extract. No10's carefully worded response that they did not recognise the language is essentially irrelevant given Cameron's repeated promises to \"roll back\" the green levies. I declared October 2011 as the date the hugged husky died, following a contemptuous anti-green speech by chancellor George Osborne at the Conservative party conference. But according to the Sun, his alleged comments reported on Thursday \"signal David Cameron's extraordinary transformation on the environment is complete\". If so, the prime minister who pledged days after taking office to lead the \"greenest government ever\" and who campaigned with the slogan \"vote blue, go green\" has committed an extraordinary betrayal of the British people. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. We've already covered the Sun/Mail story about \"green crap\" extensively. Here are four other articles I found particularly interesting. • Andrew Grice in the Independent says Nick Clegg's plan to raise the tax allowance again would help the better off more than the low paid. Nick Clegg's plan to raise the personal tax allowance will help better off people more than the low paid, according to a new study. The Liberal Democrats, who have persuaded the Conservatives to raise the income tax threshold to £10,000 a year from next April, have proposed a further rise to £10,500 in April 2015. Mr Clegg's party will fight the election the following month on a pledge to increase the allowance to £12,500 a year during the next parliament. The Lib Dems have contrasted their flagship plan to help \"ordinary workers\" with the Tories' decision to cut in the top tax rate from 50p to 45p. But analysis by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank shows that under Mr Clegg's plans, people in the seventh, eighth and ninth of the 10 deciles on the earnings ladder would see a bigger percentage rise in their income than those lower down the scale. • James Lyons in the Daily Mirror says Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press spokesman, has attacked the “bovine stupidity” of northerners who say they would never vote Conservative. Mr Ingham wrote in an article: “What worries me is the impression given by the 40% who say they won’t [ever vote Conservative]. \"At best it suggests closed minds, a certain bigotry. At worst it conveys an image of bovine stupidity.” Ingham also said refusing to vote Tory was “economically and socially suicidal”. He added: “If that is how the North wishes to be seen, so be it. \"But do not be surprised if others perceive it to be a region where a large minority is wilfully bent on its own destruction for want of a brain.” • Nazia Parveen and Eleanor Harding in the Daily Mail says Paul Flowers, the disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman, left a drug charity over allegations of up to £150,000 in false expenses claims. • Peter Oborne in the Daily Telegraph says it is no coincidence that all the MPs found guilty of expenses fraud have been Labour ones. There is an overwhelming likelihood that it is indeed statistically significant that only Labour MPs have been found guilty as a result of the expenses investigation. Labour members of the House of Commons need to face up to the uncomfortable truth. The outcome of the Telegraph investigation strongly suggests they are much more likely to lie, cheat and steal than members of other parties. Now that the expenses scandal has drawn to a close, they urgently need to ask themselves why that should be. It is especially perplexing because the party in general strongly feels itself to be the embodiment of decency and morality. Indeed Labour has always insisted that the Conservatives are the party of venality, greed and selfishness. How baffling it is, then, that only Labour MPs have been sent to jail as a result of the Telegraph revelations. Paradoxically, I believe that it is Labour’s belief in its own higher morality – what Bertrand Russell called the “superior virtue of the oppressed” – that has led to its downfall. Our two major political parties have emerged from rival philosophical traditions. Labour hails from the progressive school, which is fundamentally optimistic about human nature, but believes that our humanity is thwarted and twisted by social institutions. Conservatives are the opposite. They are pessimistic about human nature, and believe that life can only be conducted within the framework of existing institutions and the rule of law. They stress narrow objectives such as telling the truth, caring for one’s neighbour, and good manners. The Conservative tradition is extremely sceptical of ambitious schemes for social transformation. By contrast, progressives view social conventions and restraints as the crucial impediment to human fulfilment. As far as Karl Marx was concerned, law, morality and religion were simply mechanisms for maintaining bourgeois dominance. Indeed Marx’s followers explicitly licensed falsehood and deceit as instruments of revolutionary change. As J A Schumpeter observed: “The first thing a man will do for his ideals is lie.” I suggest, therefore, that the readiness of Labour MPs to fabricate their expenses is symbolic of a wider philosophical disposition: a structural tolerance of lying and cheating as a justification for political action. The Commons standards committee has cleared the Conservative MP Tim Yeo following allegations that he misused his position as chair of the Commons energy committee. This is the Press Association summary. Tory MP Tim Yeo is set to take charge of the influential Commons Environment Committee again next week after being cleared of allegations that he abused his position. Yeo stepped aside as chairman in June amid claims that he told undercover reporters he could lobby ministers on behalf of a company. He was also alleged to have coached an executive on what to say when giving evidence to his committee. But the cross-party standards committee dismissed the claims today, saying he had broken no rules and the \"only misrepresentation has been that of the journalists themselves\". The standards committee report said that while it \"deplored\" stings, it would \"not hesitate to act in such cases if wrongdoing had occurred\". But the MPs criticised the tactics used by the Sunday Times in approaching Yeo. \"We note the severe damage which is done to public trust by journalism which rests on a basis of subterfuge, misrepresentation and selective quotation,\" the report said. \"Media investigations can have a role to play in ensuring high standards of public conduct but we note that in this case Mr Yeo has broken no rules and the only misrepresentation has been that of the journalists themselves.\" Yeo, who is expected to resume chairmanship of the environment committee on Tuesday, said: \"I welcome this report. After a full investigation, the parliamentary standards commissioner accepted, as I have always maintained, that I did not break the rules of the House. \"This investigation included a thorough examination of the full video-recording produced - after a six-week delay - to the commissioner by the Sunday Times. \"Based on what I actually said, rather than what I was reported by the newspaper to have said, the commissioner found and the committee confirms that I have not acted in breach of the code of conduct.\" Here is the full report from the standards committee. • Peter Hoskin at ConservativeHome says this controversy fuels speculation that David Cameron does not have firm beliefs. This rhetorical wavering exacerbates one of the main problems with the Cameron premiership. Who is this man? What does he believe? It’s never been entirely clear whether he was committed to the green agenda all those years ago, or whether it was simply a branding exercise. And that means that – now – it’s not clear whether he’s had a change of heart, or whether he thought it was c**p all along, or whether he actually believes it all but is making concessions for electoral purposes. It’s fine for a politician to change his mind, but they have to be clear about where their mind is. Otherwise, what are voters to think? • Natan Doron at Left Foot Forward says David Cameron is misreading the public mood. What should worry the Conservative Party is the way in which Cameron’s ‘green crap’ comments represent a misreading of public opinion. Tom Newton Dunn writing in the Sun newspaper today asserts that: \"There were once centre ground votes in green politics. Now they are seen as a costly extravagance.” Fabian Society research shows that the evidence points in a different direction.Polling by the Fabian Society and WWF undertaken last year showed that a majority of Labour and Liberal Democrat voters support shifting to a low-carbon economy – as do more Conservative voters than not. Crucially support among swing voters – the group that’s crucial to deciding the outcome of the next election – was even higher. The voters that the Conservatives need to win over to improve on their 2010 election showing are far more supportive of the transition to a low-carbon economy than David Cameron realises. This plays out on the ground in a host of important election battles. Some of them don’t involve Conservatives so may not appear on Cameron’s radar – a foolish error. An example is Hornsey and Wood Green where the Liberal Democrat incumbent Lynne Featherstone has an increasingly vulnerable majority. Voters in this seat care passionately about the environment – a host of green activist groups meet and campaign regularly in the seat. They will mind that their MP has voted against a 2030 decarbonisation target and is propping up a Conservative-led administration whose leader dismisses their key concerns as ‘green crap’. • George Eaton at the Staggers says Downing Street's line on the affair is a non-denial denial. • Paul Owen at the Guardian rounds up the best mockery of Cameron over this on Twitter. And the Daily Express's Patrick O'Flynn on Twitter has a good point on Twitter. 1. Generally, although not everything that appears in newspapers is true, most of it is. This story appears in two newspapers, the Sun (where it is the splash) and the Daily Mail (where it is on page two). Both papers attribute the key quote to a \"senior Tory source\". The Sun says: A senior Tory source said: \"The prime minister is going round Number 10 saying: 'We have got to get rid of all this green crap'. He is totally focussed on it. \"We used to say 'Vote Blue, Go Green', now it's 'Vote Blue, Get Real'.\" And the Mail says: The source said: ‘He’s telling everyone, “We’ve got to get rid of all this green crap.” He’s absolutely focused on it.’ Tory high command has also privately abandoned Mr Cameron’s pre-election mantra ‘vote blue, go green’. ‘It’s vote blue, get real, now – and woe betide anyone who doesn’t get the memo,’ the source said. Both stories were written by lobby correspondents. It is common for lobby correspondents from rival papers to team up to invite contacts out for lunch, where the conversation is normally conducted on \"lobby terms\" (ie, nothing reported will be attributed to a named source). This seems to have happened on this occasion. Sometimes you will hear aggrieved politicians claim that lobby journalists in these circumstances distort quotes, but in my experience these complaints are rarely justified and, if the Sun and the Daily Mail are saying a \"senior Tory source\" said this, I'm happy to accept that he or she did. 2. But was the source quoting Cameron verbatim, or was he/she paraphrasing? In other words, is it Cameron himself saying: \"We've got to get rid of all this green crap.\" Or was the source using his own phrase to paraphrase the gist of what Cameron has been saying? Both are possible, although the second explanation is more likely. The source does not seem to have been referring to a specific conversation. Instead, he was summarising a message that Cameron has supposedly being giving out generally. 3. That said, Downing Street did not actually deny that Cameron had said this this morning (and I was surprised to see the BBC and others reporting that he had). A Downing Street spokesman put out a statement saying: \"We do not recognise this phrase.\" This is a piece of spin doctor lingo (that may have originated with New Labour) that normally means: \"We did not put this out ourselves, we want to distance ourselves from it, but we cannot say for certain that the words in the story were never actually used.\" Subsequently Sky's Joey Jones reported a slightly stronger denial: After I heard that, I rang No 10 telling them if they could give me a statement saying Cameron had never used the phrase \"green crap\", I would be happy to publish it. But the spokesman just repeated the line about \"not recognising this phrase\". I have not had a call back. 4. Does it sound like Cameron? Actually, it does. I can believe that at some point he may have used this phrase (which might by why Downing Street is not issuing a firm denial). But it is quite possible both that: a) the source was paraphrasing Cameron when he spoke to the Sun and the Daily Mail and; b) Cameron has uttered the phrase himself at some point. 5. But, if he did, it probably wasn't in front of his wife. Samantha Cameron is said to be much more keen on this \"green crap\" (to use what may or may not be Cameron's term) than her husband. 6. And, ultimately, whether he said it or not is irrelevant - because the best way to judge a politician is by what they do, not by what they say. And, on this count, the evidence is overwhelming: since coming to power, the Conservatives have been far less committed to the green agenda than they were in opposition, and, with energy bills rising, enthusiasm for costly investment in renewables is fading by the week. Nick Clegg was defending David Cameron this morning (see 9.40am), but two weeks ago he gave a speech largely devoted to attacking the Tories for treating green issues as a distraction. Verdict: Sometimes stories don't have to be true to be true. James Callaghan never uttered the words \"Crisis? What crisis?\", but the Sun headline reflected the complacency that Callaghan seemed to be displaying when he returned to the UK from a trip abroad during the winter of discontent in 1979 and so it was certainly true in spirit. And this story is in the same category. Perhaps David Cameron has not been explicitly telling colleagues to \"get rid of all this green crap\" (although, for reasons explained in 3 and 4, I think it more likely than not that the phrase \"green crap\" has passed his lips). But this is certainly a fair description of the Conservatives' current stance on the environment. So, good scoop. And there is some creative poster rewriting going on on Twitter following the \"green crap\" controversy. Here's the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, a committed environmentalist, passing on what he says is a comment from a Tory in the Commons tea room on David Cameron's alleged \"green crap\" comment. Here's Joss Garman, deputy political director at Greenpeace, responding to the claims that David Cameron has talked about getting rid of \"this green crap\". If David Cameron thinks the road to electoral victory will be found in attacking the very policies that he once passionately advocated then he is sorely mistaken. The British electorate are a sophisticated bunch who will see through his chameleon tendencies and conclude this attack is not an act of leadership but one of cowardice as he panders to the extreme wing of his own party and tries to claw back support from UKIP. The real crime is that every time David Cameron reaches for the dog whistle playbook he undermines thousands of jobs in the green energy sector and threatens future investment. Now that really is crap. Friends of the Earth has been saying it would be \"little surprise\" if Cameron did tell aides to get rid of green crap. \"His government has been attacking environmental policies for years,\" said Craig Bennett, FoE's campaigns director. The full quote from Bennett is in Rowena Mason's story about the controversy. In Downing Street this morning David Cameron had a meeting with some of the leaders of Britain's biggest councils who were presenting him with a petition backing HS2. He was asked if he still believed in the green agenda. He replied: \"This is part of it.\" HS2 was \"a very green project\", he said. He went on to spell out some of his green credentials. We've got the the world's first green investment bank. We've got great support for our green technology industries. We've got a first nuclear power station since 1995. This is a government investing in green projects. Hi. It's Andrew Sparrow here, taking over from Paul Owen. Here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 40% (up 2 points from YouGov yesterday) Conservatives: 32% (down 2) Ukip: 12% (up 1) Lib Dems: 9% (down 1) Labour lead: 8 points (up 4) Government approval: -28 (down 1) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 104. Here's a brief summary: • Nick Clegg said it was right to examine the accountability of the security services and the proportionality of their use of new technologies. But he refused to be drawn on the specifics of the Guardian's revelations that the US was spying on UK citizens without Britain's knowledge, saying he was \"not going to comment on one article that has appeared this morning in the newspapers\". Pressed on the issue, he said Barack Obama was holding a review into the US National Security Agency's powers and there were also reviews going on in Britain. • Clegg said the Sun's claim that David Cameron wanted to get rid of \"green crap\" – environmental levies on energy bills – was not a \"fair reflection\" of the prime minister's views. He said he was not going to \"abandon the environment\". • The deputy prime minister said Labour had \"some very searching questions\" to ask about donations given by ex-Co-op chief Paul Flowers, who has been accused of financial incompetence and buying hard drugs. Clegg is asked about the Monty Python team reforming. \"Are they?\" asks a shocked Clegg. He confirms he is more of a Python fan than a Yes, Prime Minister fan. \"I love Monty Python.\" He says they are \"still cutting edge\", pointing out \"these zany, totally loopy cartoons\". And that's it. Clegg is asked about the Guardian's story explaining that the phone, internet and email records of UK citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing have been analysed and stored by America's National Security Agency under a secret deal that was approved by British intelligence officials. In addition a draft memo, marked top-secret and dated from 2005, reveals a proposed NSA procedure for spying on the citizens of the UK and other Five-Eyes nations, even where the partner government has explicitly denied the US permission to do so. The memo makes clear that partner countries must not be informed about this surveillance, or even the procedure itself. Clegg says the security agencies are run by very, very diligent people who take their duty to keep us safe very seriously. They work within the law. But the technologies now used by the agencies are far more powerful and can store and analyse data on a scale we've never known before, he says. This was \"unimaginable\" even a few years ago. So it is right to ask about the proportionality of intelligence gathering today and the accountability of the services. What about the decision the US took to spy on UK citizens? Clegg says he is \"not going to comment on one article that has appeared this morning in the newspapers\". He says the system of oversight is \"quite an obscure process to the public\". He says there is a legitimate question to ask: \"How do you make sure you have proper accountability, proper proportionality\" of the use of these technologies? The listener says he has not answered the specific question about the US secretly spying on UK citizens. Clegg says Obama is having a review. But what is the UK doing, Ferrari asks. Clegg says there are reviews here too, for example by the intelligence and security committee. You could have \"different kinds of inquiries and reviews\", he says. Clegg is asked if the NHS can introduce a fine for patients' missed appointments. He says he is aware that this is \"a real issue ... a constant issue\". He does not support a system of fines, though. And he does not support charging people to see their GPs. But some GPs' surgeries are much more effective than others at checking on patients and reminding them not to make appointments they won't keep. Other surgeries could learn from these ones. Clegg is asked about simplifying the tax system for freelancers. The DPM says that in addition to \"massively simplifying the tax system\" by increasing the tax threshold, he says HMRC has improved the PAYE system and its digital support. Ferrari asks about the Sun \"green crap\" story. Clegg says \"it isn't all crap, of course\". These policies support tens of thousands of people in the \"booming\" green energy sector and help consumers by saving them money in the long run through insulating their homes. \"I don't think that's a fair reflection of his views,\" Clegg says of Cameron. Of course we are going to try to reduce the cost of these measures, he says. One option is for the government to pay for them. \"That's my view and by the way I also know it's the prime minister's view.\" He says he is not going to \"abandon the environment\". \"When the Lib Dems are condemned to political history at the next election ... \" the next question begins, will Clegg hire out special advisers to the government? Clegg tells the listener to place money on his prediction the Lib Dems will face political oblivion: \"you'll lose your money\". Clegg says there are 96 or 98 special advisers in the government, about 70 Tory and about 20 Lib Dems (he does not mention the other six or eight). Ferrari says the wage bill for them is £1.3m. Clegg says the average wage of special advisers is 9% lower than it was under Labour. Clegg says he accepts they are controversial and so he is transparent about their role. You need some of the advisers in government to make sure coalition works effectively. Clegg is asked about Vince Cable's description of small investors in the Royal Mail as \"fly-by-night investors\". Clegg says he will talk to Cable about this. He says Cable was not referring to small shareholders – in fact he had wanted to ensure access for individual investors. But he had wanted to avoid \"big money\" coming in from people \"betting on its value\". He had wanted institutional investors, and he's broadly got the balance right, Clegg says. Ferrari says Cable did get the valuation of the Royal Mail wrong though. Clegg says you can't judge a company like that in a matter of weeks or months. Markets tend to \"gyrate wildly one way and then the other\". The price he settled on was at the upper end of what he was advised. \"Politicians don't pluck these prices out of thin air.\" Is he getting on all right with Cable, asks Ferrari. Clegg thanks for him for his \"pastoral care\". Ferrari says Vince wants to be taken out for a pint. Clegg says they've eaten together at his home, and at a restaurant recently. But next time they'll have a pint. \"Thanks for the relationship counselling,\" says Clegg. Would it matter to Clegg if Cameron had taken cocaine in the past? It has never occurred to me to quiz my colleagues on their previous habits, he says. Clearly it wouldn't matter to me if it hasn't occurred to me. People's past is people's past, he says. Should Ed Miliband return Paul Flowers's donations? Clegg says every week there is another series of question marks about who \"runs and funds\" the Labour party. Clegg says it sounds \"extremely murky\" and asks why the Labour party did not realise Flowers was an inappropriate figure. \"I think there's some very searching questions to be asked\", he says, and \"the Labour party will want to account for itself\". He adds that Labour \"almost acts like puppets on a string\" for the unions. He wishes there could be a cross-party deal on party funding, but Labour and the Tories blocked it. He says he has never knowingly met Flowers. Next Clegg is asked about the reductions in the British army and linked rise in the reservists. How will a recruiting campaign and money for reservists be paid for? Clegg says the number of reservists will go up from 19,000 to 30,000. The government will provide more money and make it more effective, but the system is broadly speaking in place already, he says. He says this will create a more effective way of deploying military personnel. Many people put themselves forward for the reservists not for financial reasons, Clegg says. The caller uses the example of someone in the dental corp – so presumably a well-paid dentist in civilian life. Call Clegg begins. The DPM is asked if he is being unpatriotic and self-serving in wanting to stop people discussing leaving the EU. Clegg says making ourselves poorer, less safe and \"less sustainable\" by leaving the EU would be the wrong decision. But of course the EU needs reform, he says. He adds that it is not in Scotland's interest to leave the UK either. The caller says the people want to discuss this. Is Switzerland doing badly outside the EU? They are actually, says Clegg. Presenter Nick Ferrari plays a clip of Clegg saying the view that the UK should leave the EU is \"unpatriotic\". Clegg says it is, but he welcomes the debate. He says he is \"the leader of the party of in\". The caller says he wants EU membership to be renegotiated, but he doesn't want to leave the union. Clegg says when the treaties next change, there should be a referendum, \"and the question should be 'in or out'\". Nick Clegg's phone-in is coming up shortly. You can listen to it online here. No 10 has been drawing a distinction between \"tackling climate change\" and the green levies on energy bills, in the wake of the Sun's \"green crap\" story. A Downing Street source told the Press Association, in reference to David Cameron's vow to the Commons last month to \"roll back\" the green levies that fund renewable power subsidies and programmes to insulate homes: He has been quite clear about rolling back the impact of levies on energy bills, but only last week in Sri Lanka he was talking about the importance of tackling climate change. On that trip to Sri Lanka for a Commonwealth summit, Cameron said: I'll leave the scientists to speak for themselves about the link between severe weather events and climate change. But the evidence seems to me to be growing. As a practical politician, I think the sensible thing is to say let's take preventative and mitigating steps given the chances this might be the case. Hi there. Andrew Sparrow has to go to a press briefing first thing this morning, so it’s me, Paul Owen, with you until about 10am. Hope you’re all well. Here’s what’s on the agenda today: 9am: Nick Clegg appears on his regular LBC radio phone-in show Call Clegg. 9am: Alex Salmond due to speak at an international conference on natural resources in Edinburgh. 9.30am: Public sector borrowing figures for October released by the Office for National Statistics. 9.30am: Environment, food and rural affairs questions in the Commons. 9.45am: The Queen is visiting the top of the Shard. Not politics? Damn ... 10.15am: Vince Cable, the business secretary, is speaking at the National Federation of Builders conference. So far today there have been a couple of interesting stories around. • Downing Street has rejected the idea that David Cameron is ditching his commitment to the environment, after the Sun’s front page claimed he had told aides to \"get rid of all this green crap\". An unnamed senior Tory source told the paper, in reference to green levies that push up energy bills: The prime minister is going round Number 10 saying 'We have got to get rid of all this green crap'. He is totally focussed on it. We used to say 'Vote Blue, Go Green', now it's 'Vote Blue, Get Real'. But a senior Downing Street source told the Press Association: \"We do not recognise this phrase that they are using on their front page.\" Cameron stated his determination to lead the \"greenest government ever\" upon coming to power in 2010, and had spent much of his early years as leader attempting to establish green credentials for the Tories – including with an attention-grabbing trip to the Arctic circle in 2006. • Ed Miliband has said his party acted with \"utmost integrity\" in its dealings with the Co-op Bank and its disgraced former chairman Rev Paul Flowers. The Labour leader told ITV News: Paul Flowers was somebody who I met with on one occasion and had meetings with a wider group on a couple of other occasions. He was never my close adviser. The important thing now is to make sure that the Co-op can go from strength to strength in the future and the police need to look at any matters that arise for them. Asked if he welcomed the inquiries announced by Cameron, Miliband said: Let's see what the government proposes. What I am utterly confident about is the Labour party always acts with the utmost integrity and we did on this occasion too. All this and more from me and then Andrew throughout the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/mar/16/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-16T17:39:41Z","webTitle":"New generation of power stations 'risk terrorist anarchy', warns expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/16/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/mar/16/nuclearpower-nuclear-waste","fields":{"headline":"New generation of nuclear power stations 'risk terrorist anarchy'","bodyText":"The new generation of atomic power stations planned for Britain, China and many other parts of the world risks proliferation that could lead to \"nuclear anarchy\", a security expert warned in a report published today. Governments and multilateral organisations must come up with a strategy to deal the impact of the new nuclear age, which will produce enough plutonium to make 1m nuclear weapons by 2075, argues Frank Barnaby from the Oxford Research Group thinktank in a paper for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). \"We are at a crossroads. Unless governments work together to safeguard nuclear energy supplies, the rise in unsecured nuclear technology will put us all in danger. Without this, we are hurtling towards a state of nuclear anarchy where terrorists or rogue states have the ways and means of making nuclear weapons or 'dirty bombs', the consequences of which are unimaginable,\" says Barnaby. Any country choosing to operate new-generation nuclear reactors in future would have relatively easy access to plutonium, which is used to make the most efficient atomic weapons, along with the nuclear physicists and engineers to design them. These countries would be latent nuclear-weapon powers \"and it is to be expected that some will take the political decision to become actual nuclear weapons powers,\" argues Barnaby in his paper submitted to the IPPR's independent Commission on National Security chaired by former Nato boss, Lord George Robertson. The issue of nuclear proliferation security has been largely ignored until today as the nuclear power debate has concentrated on the economics, social issues and how to deal with radioactive waste. Ministers in the UK have made clear their desire to see a new generation of facilities to replace existing ones at a time when North Sea gas is running out and the country needs to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to meet its Kyoto protocol carbon emission targets. Nuclear power plants across the life cycle produce one third of the CO2 of gas-fired ones. Barnaby says that a shortage of uranium for the kind of reactors that EDF and others are considering building in Britain could encourage them to reprocess fuel and produce more plutonium. But he is equally convinced that a nuclear renaissance will lead to fast breeder reactors which produce more nuclear fuel than they use and which could be useful to terrorists. The Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have already suggested that uranium resources would last less than 70 years if processed using the current generation of light water nuclear reactors. Barnaby wants the non-proliferation treaty strengthened at a \"make or break\" review conference next year and would also like to see countries as yet without nuclear capabilities discouraged from obtaining enriched uranium, a problem highlighted in the case of Iran. Ian Kearns, deputy commissioner of the IPPR's security commission, said it was crucial that the rush to address climate change did not worsen the international security environment. \"A global nuclear renaissance, if badly managed, could bring enormous complications in terms of nuclear non-proliferation and terrorism. Policymakers need to be alert to the dangers and to construct policies that bring secure low-carbon energy and a stable nuclear weapons environment,\" he said. Companies such as E.ON of Germany who want to build new nuclear plants in Britain declined to comment on the issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/dec/28/china-areva-taishan-nuclear-thibault","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-28T14:00:50Z","webTitle":"Construction schedule on Chinese third-generation nuclear plants races ahead of European models","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/28/china-areva-taishan-nuclear-thibault","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/dec/28/china-areva-taishan-nuclear-thibault","fields":{"headline":"Construction schedule on Chinese third-generation nuclear plants races ahead of European models","bodyText":"The workers in their blue overalls and yellow helmets waste little time, ignoring the view of the South China Sea. \"They don't hang around,\" says Rémi Sénac, the Areva representative at Taishan, Guangdong province, where work on the first two European pressurised reactors (EPRs) is going well. France's nuclear conglomerate takes pride in the progress being made on the third-generation reactors sold to China in November 2007. Things have worked out much better here than at Flamanville, in western France, and at Olkiluoto in Finland. The first reactor, currently no more than a metal cylinder 39 metres high, stands in the middle of a lunar landscape extending over 450 hectares, served by some 20 cranes. Nearby, the dome – which will cap the structure containing the 1,660-MW reactor – is waiting for its last two rings to be added. The symbolic act of lifting the dome on to the building is scheduled for May 2011, a month ahead of its French counterpart, on which work started earlier. The difference reflects the steep learning curve for new technology. Engineering work on the two Chinese reactors draws on the experience Areva has gained on the other two jobs. The number of subcontractors has also been limited to simplify the division of labour, and changes have been made to several welding procedures. Areva's partner, the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Company (CGNPC), one of the two companies that dominate the Chinese market for civilian nuclear power, also benefits from the experience of its own subcontractors, who have been working at full capacity since the 1980s when China started trying to reduce its dependence on coal. \"Their civil engineering firms haven't stopped building power stations since,\" says Roger Seban, the deputy chief executive of TSNPC, the joint venture that has enabled the French utility company EDF to take part in the project. Another essential ingredient is Chinese labour; there are 9,000 workers currently on site. Instead of working three eight-hour shifts, as is common in Europe, the people working for Hua Xing, the concrete contractor on the first Taishan reactor, work 10-hour stints, seven days a week. Financial incentives help keep the workers and contractors on track. \"One of the most important factors for the economics of a project like this is sticking to the original schedule,\" says Eric Neisse, a deputy manager at Areva-China. Especially since CGNPC is competing with another state-owned company, which has opted to install a third-generation reactor built by Toshiba-Westinghouse. Every summer typhoons sweep through Guangdong. A dyke had to built along the coast, with channels cut into the surrounding hills to divert the rain. The seawater is warmer here than in northern Europe, so a 4km tunnel had to be bored for the cooling system on each reactor to draw in cold water from the sea. The two reactors should be commissioned at the end of 2013 and in autumn 2014 respectively. In the meantime, Areva hopes to have started work on more reactors thanks to Wecan, another joint venture in which CGNPC has taken a majority share, an essential point in this strategically vital sector for China. As everyone is quick to point out, the Taishan site could accommodate six reactors. Work on two of them is just waiting for government approval. In fact, to save time, the earthworks are already complete.

Although the exact route of the convoy is being kept secret, protesters have organised demonstrations at cities along its 900-mile route. At least 17,000 German riot police are poised for what could be one of the biggest anti-nuclear demonstrations in years. By early this afternoon hundreds of activists had chained themselves to trees along the route or were preparing to lock themselves to the railway track. The specially constructed low-speed train, carrying 123 tonnes of German radioactive waste, which was reprocessed in eastern France, started out today from Valognes, Normandy, near La Hague. It was expected to cross the French-German border early tomorrow and to arrive in Gorleben, in the far north-east of Lower Saxony, a few hours later. Yannick Rousselet, of Greenpeace, said: \"Never in history has such a quantity of radioactive material ever been transported.\" Laura Hameaux, of Sortir du Nucléaire, a network of 875 anti-nuclear groups, said: \"It is at least twice the radioactivity of all the radioactive pollution from the Chernobyl catastrophe and [local people] haven't even been informed of its route.\" The waste convoy is the 11th of its type between France and Germany since 1996. In 2004 an anti-nuclear protester died in France after his leg was cut off by a train transporting nuclear waste to Germany. He had been sitting on the railway track. Protesters have tried to block previous trains, but protests over the latest convoy have been boosted in Germany by growing public anger at the decision by Angela Merkel's government to extend the life of the country's existing nuclear power plants for an extra 12 years. The decision is a reversal of one of the policy achievements of the government of the former Social Democratic chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Areva, the industrial conglomerate and leader in nuclear power, has agreements with Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland to reprocess spent fuel from nuclear power plants. It receives, stores and processes the fuel, which remains the property of the country that produced it; the waste is sent back after treatment. The latest shipment of waste will arrive in the German town of Dannenberg tomorrow and be transported the final 12 miles by lorry to Gorleben to be dumped into underground shafts. There are doubts about the safety of the storage following evidence of a high danger of groundwater contamination at the site. Rebecca Harms, a Green MEP, said she expected the protest to be the biggest for years. \"This year's transport of nuclear waste will provoke more opposition than ever before. It's time that people's concerns are finally listened to.\" she said. Greenpeace has warned that the load contains even higher than normal levels of radioactive waste, due to the fact that the rods were in use for longer than usual. Police and politicians have called for the nuclear industry, and not the taxpayer, to foot the €50m (£43m) bill the security operation is expected to cost. Areva said today: \"All operations related to these transports and the equipment used comply with the relevant national and international regulations that have been issued with the involvement of representatives from member states.\" The company insists the waste containers have been designed to withstand a 50-metre fall on to concrete and a fire of 800C (1,472F) lasting 30 minutes. Christophe Neugnot, Areva spokesman, called Greenpeace's action a smokescreen avoiding \"the real issue of the rebirth of nuclear power throughout Europe\". He said: \"If we want to produce electricity all the time at a reduced price and without heating up the planet we cannot do without nuclear. Renewable energies remain insufficient today. This convoy is less radioactive than six similar transports carried out by Areva in the last few years. We have nothing to hide.\" Greenpeace is suing Areva for what is says is \"illegal storage of waste\" at Valognes. Anti-nuclear protesters said they were not aiming to hold up the convoy but highlight the failure of the nuclear industry to find long-term solutions to the waste it produces. Every year about 7,000 cubic metres of waste are produced by the 143 nuclear reactors in the EU. \"It's like thinking up the idea of an aeroplane without thinking of where it's going to land,\" Rousselet said. Waste disposal The radioactive by-products of nuclear fission were processed by heating the waste until the liquid evaporated and formed a powder which was then \"vitrified\" – fused with glass in a melting furnace. The molten glass was then poured into stainless steel canisters, left to cool and fitted with a welded cover. The canisters, weighing 400kg each, are being carried in 11 train wagons made of forged steel or cast iron that have been used to transport nuclear waste between France and Germany since 1996. Another four carriages in the train are occupied by French CRS – armed riot police – ready to intervene in the event of security breaches. Helicopters are flying over the train paying particular attention to bridges and possible obstacles on the railway line. On arrival the estimated 308 canisters will be removed from their casks and buried into rock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/aug/14/riots-liberties-authoritarian-hyperbole","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-14T20:00:05Z","webTitle":"The door has been left open for authoritarian hyperbole | John Kampfner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/14/riots-liberties-authoritarian-hyperbole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/14/riots-liberties-authoritarian-hyperbole","fields":{"headline":"The door has been left open for authoritarian hyperbole","bodyText":"After 50 years of carrot it's time for some stick, remonstrated the Mail on Sunday. Have the riots hardened the public mood towards law and order, or is this the easy bombast of the headline writer and the politician scuttling home from Tuscany? When people are being killed, homes destroyed and shops looted, it is no surprise that politicians mock concern over civil liberties. At best they are a distraction, at worst they are at the root of our \"sick\" and \"feral\" society. Or to adapt the old line: if a conservative is a liberal who's been mugged by reality, the 2011 variant is a small shopkeeper who has seen their livelihood destroyed by rampaging thugs. Anybody who cares about liberties and rights must acknowledge the anger and bewilderment at the sight of law enforcement seemingly powerless to intervene. Emergencies such as these follow a familiar pattern. Immediately after the 7/7 London bombings, Tony Blair declared the \"rules of the game have changed\". He was responding to the shock and the fear of worse to come. Many of the measures he pledged were purely playing to the gallery. Many have not been implemented. But the political mood encouraged him to talk tough. For that same reason, David Cameron instantly denounced \"phoney concerns about human rights\" the moment he returned to \"take charge\". He followed this up with a call for \"zero tolerance\" and the appointment of Bill Bratton, a US police chief-cum-gangbuster, as his unpaid adviser. Ed Miliband has been careful not to fall into what he believes to be a trap – denunciations of criminality must come first, second and third. Any attempt to explain or analyse must follow distantly behind. Any attempt to wean Labour away from the authoritarianism of the Blair-Blunkett era is on indefinite hold. As for Nick Clegg, this is another difficult moment. The Liberal Democrats' role in the coalition is to tame the rougher edges of Conservatism. But how can they do that now? There are two areas to focus on. Cameron's reference to \"sick\" parts of society has been confined to the rioting youths. Yet an atmosphere of impunity has been fostered from the top. Two weeks before the riots I signed up to a statement by the Compass pressure group calling for Britain's \"feral elite\" – bankers, media phone hackers and MPs on the take – to be held to account. If any \"clampdown\" is to be carried out, it should not be confined to the so-called underclass. The second area liberals need to influence is policing. It is unhealthy, particularly at moments such as these, for relations between police chiefs and ministers to be as tense as they are. The specific measures that the home secretary, Theresa May, and the prime minister have called for so far are long on rhetoric, short on practicality. Police already have the power to force protesters and others to remove hoodies and headwear preventing identification. As for blocking instant messaging and other forms of technology, I am told that when this was first raised at the Cobra emergency group, police chiefs, security officials and cabinet ministers made it clear this was unenforceable. Entire mobile networks would have to be taken down. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said this was the sort of the thing the government protested about when tried (unsuccessfully) by the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes. In situations such as these, the gulf between self-professed civil libertarians and authoritarians is narrowed. Efficiency is an important element of criminal justice policy and public confidence in it. Everyone has their own stories about their frustrations with the police. When, a few years ago, I had the window of a ground floor bedroom smashed by a local teenager, I was happy to identify him. I was told by the coppers that it wasn't worth their while taking him in; he'd be out on the streets hours later. Instead they dispatched the forensics, followed up two days later by a \"trauma counsellor\". Multiply such stories around the country, and confidence in the criminal justice system erodes. The door is then left open for authoritarian hyperbole. As we found after 7/7, targeted and intelligent anti-terrorism measures often receive wide public support. When they creep and are abused – for example, to stop people protesting against arms fairs or nuclear power stations, or to eavesdrop on the phones or computers of people who fail to clear up dog litter – an environment is created of security forces working for the state rather than the community. New Labour's authoritarianism years were based on a wilful misreading of the requirements of public order. Individuals protesting with loudhailers might be inconvenient; they are not a threat. Policing by consent must not be dismantled. But it must be robust. It should not mean fear of causing offence, or refusing to tackle gangs. The police deserve stronger public support. They should get it, as long as they, and politicians, focus on the needs of the communities they serve and not the needs of an overbearing state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2010/nov/16/stuxnet-worm-iran-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-16T18:01:50Z","webTitle":"Stuxnet worm is aimed to sabotage Iran's nuclear ambition, new research shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/16/stuxnet-worm-iran-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/nov/16/stuxnet-worm-iran-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Stuxnet worm is aimed to sabotage Iran's nuclear ambition, new research shows","bodyText":"Two new independent examinations of the Stuxnet computer worm, thought to be the work of a national government agency, show that it was definitely built to target technology used at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant. Described as one of the \"most refined pieces of malware ever discovered,\" Stuxnet took direct aim at industrial systems based in Iran, whose first nuclear power station recently began operations. Speaking to the Guardian in September, security experts said the attack was likely a state-sponsored case of \"modern espionage\". Now new research by cyber security firm Symantec shows definitively that Stuxnet was built to target uranium enrichment equipment used to fuel Tehran's controversial nuclear programme. Eric Chien, a researcher at Symantec, said the the company had \"connected a critical piece of the puzzle\" with the finding. Stuxnet works by sabotaging frequency converter drives used to alter the speed of motors in factory machinery, the study shows. The worm only attacks drives that run at a higher speed – between 807 Hertz (Hz) and 1210 Hz. When Stuxnet finds drives running at those speeds, it begins changing their revolution speed dramatically - \"to 1410Hz and then to 2Hz and then to 1064Hz,\" Symantec says. That could make a system tear itself apart due to inertial effects, and would certainly prevent it functioning properly. \"Modification of the output frequency essentially sabotages the automation system [preventing it] from operating properly,\" Chien said. That Iran is the target emerges from the second part of the discovery, Symantec's team explains: \"we can now confirm that Stuxnet requires the industrial control system to have frequency converter drives from at least one of two specific vendors, one headquartered in Finland and the other in Tehran, Iran. This is in addition to the previous requirements we discussed of a S7-300 CPU and a CP-342-5 Profibus communications module.\" They note that \"while frequency converter drives are used in many industrial control applications, these speeds are used only in a limited number of applications.\" Specifically, \"efficient low-harmonic frequency converter drives that output over 600Hz are regulated for export in the United States by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as they can be used for uranium enrichment. We would be interested in hearing what other applications use frequency converter drives at these frequencies.\" The worm was identified by a Belarusian security firm working for an Iranian client earlier this year, after finding that some technology in the Tehran plant wasn't working properly. Experts said the worm must have been well-funded and that the team which wrote it probably comprised between five and 10 people, and would have taken around six months to ready for deployment. Ivanka Barzashka, a research associate at the Federation of American Scientists, told Reuters: \"If Symantec's analysis is true, then Stuxnet likely aimed to destroy Iran's gas centrifuges, which could produce enriched uranium for both nuclear fuel and nuclear bombs.\" Another computer security firm, Langner Communications of Germany, also independently found that the worm was designed to target systems used in power plants, such as those at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Alan Bentley, senior international vice president at security firm Lumension, said Stuxnet is \"the most refined piece of malware ever discovered\", and that the worm was significant because \"mischief or financial reward wasn't its purpose, it was aimed right at the heart of a critical infrastructure\". Graham Cluley, a senior consultant with the online security firm Sophos, told the Guardian that the attack heralded the \"third age\" of cyber crime, where \"there are political, economic and military ways in which the internet can be exploited – and malware can be used – to gain advantage by foreign states,\" he said. \"I think we will see more and more attacks which will be blamed on state-sponsored cyber attacks. There have been numerous attacks in the past which could be said to have possible military, political or economic motives, but it is very difficult to prove that a hack was ordered by Mossad or instead dreamt up by a Macclesfield student.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jun/15/gm-regulators-pesticides-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-15T14:10:55Z","webTitle":"GM regulators chose ignorance over science | Jonathan Latham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/15/gm-regulators-pesticides-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/15/gm-regulators-pesticides-safety","fields":{"headline":"GM regulators chose ignorance over science","bodyText":"If you don't look before crossing roads you will, before long, be hit by a truck. Even if you do look but neglect to account for bends in the road, sooner or later you will still be hit by a truck. Precaution is a simple lifesaving logic that some governments have attempted to codify as \"the precautionary principle\" to reduce the probability that new technologies and industrial products will later bite back. It is a logic, however, that many industries, scientists and (notably) the US government, vehemently oppose. Last month, however, came a salutary lesson in the value of looking at the science before one leaps. In May, the journal Reproductive Toxicology published a paper that showed Canadian women now routinely have GM pesticides – called Bt toxins – present in their blood streams. So, too, do 80% of their unborn babies. Presumably, they acquired the toxins by eating GM corn or from livestock fed on it. By itself, this result does not prove that any harm has occurred – though it is hardly reassuring. And, as the first experiment of its kind, it needs repeating. What it does definitively prove, however, is equally important: the remarkable complacency of the global safety regulators of GM crops who have argued that this was impossible. Finding Bt toxins in human blood highlights two particular regulatory decisions that illustrate this complacency. Regulators first decided to rely on a simple model of a human gut (a test tube, actually) to convince themselves that Bt toxins are completely broken down during digestion. They then chose to assume that this proved Bt toxins would never reach human organs. This led to their second crucial decision, which was not to require meaningful toxicological tests on Bt toxins. The flaws in their reasoning stand starkly exposed by the Reproductive Toxicology paper. Not only have simple blood tests apparently demolished what regulators have long argued – that Bt toxins are not absorbed – but the paper also illustrates how easy it would have been for regulators to check their test-tube assumptions. These failings are not merely a question of regulators disregarding the precautionary principle. What is rarely appreciated is that the precautionary principle is also good science. As Karl Popper first argued in the 1930s, science proceeds largely by testing hypotheses against data. Refusing to test a hypothesis was not entertained by Popper as a serious scientific choice. To to actively choose ignorance – which is effectively what these regulators have been doing – is neither good science nor good regulation. Because regulators made the decisions they did, this new data raises potentially very serious and presently unanswerable safety questions about GM crops. No one, for example, can say if Bt toxins are likely to harm humans, since there is so little toxicological data available. Second, the findings open up a safety issue that regulators have always considered closed: that meat from animals fed GM plants might take up novel GM components and thus be different or unsafe. Third, the results may apply to other GM pesticides. If they do, human exposure to these toxins may be much higher than the authors observed. It is hard to imagine a finding more damaging to the credibility of GM regulatory institutions. That regulators should repeatedly choose ignorance over both precaution (which is required by EU law in this case) and good science will probably surprise most readers. That is because there is a myth, much promoted by governments and industry, that scientific risk assessments typically fail only when events or science take an unforeseeable turn. Detailed examinations of historical failures consistently show something very different. From thalidomide to BSE, oil rigs and nuclear power stations, failures result when regulators specifically and repeatedly choose not to know crucial facts. In the simplest possible terms, they cross roads regardless."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/feb/23/vermont-yankee-nuclear-reactor-to-close","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-23T16:06:26Z","webTitle":"Obama's nuclear vision suffers setback as Vermont plant faces shutdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/23/vermont-yankee-nuclear-reactor-to-close","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/feb/23/vermont-yankee-nuclear-reactor-to-close","fields":{"headline":"Obama's nuclear vision suffers setback as Vermont plant faces shutdown","bodyText":"Barack Obama's new dream of a nuclear renaissance faces a major reality check tomorrow when the state of Vermont is expected to shut down an ageing nuclear reactor with a history of leaks. It would be the first time a state has moved to shut down such a reactor, and follows Obama's announcement last week of $8.3bn (£5.4bn) in loan guarantees for the construction of two new reactors in Georgia. White House officials said the money would help spur a burst of new construction – the first since the Three Mile Island meltdown. The Vermont Yankee, one of America's oldest reactors, has had several leaks of radioactive tritium dating back to 2005, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said yesterday. The state senate is set to deny a request to extend its 40-year life span by an additional 20 years condemning the plant to close in 2012, said Peter Shumlin, the highest ranking member of the Vermont senate. \"It is not in Vermont's best interest to run this plant beyond its scheduled closing date in 2012. It is falling apart,\" said Shumlin. The 30-member senate, which is controlled by Democrats, is due to vote tomorrow morning. The battle over the so-called Vermont Yankee reactor has attracted an increasingly national audience amid growing disaffection among liberals and environmentalists with Obama's support for the nuclear industry. Shumlin and other opponents of the plant argue that America has yet to plan for the safe retirement of its existing 104 reactors, which are beginning to approach the end of their original life spans. Some 27 of those reactors have had leaks of tritium, according to the nuclear regulatory commission. \"The debate here isn't whether or not we build new nuclear power plants. The question for America is how can we be so irresponsible and so negligent in expecting our old tired plants to run past their scheduled closing dates,\" Shumlin said. The 38-year-old Vermont Yankee plant, which is owned by the New Orleans based Entergy Corp, is among the first of that older generation of reactors, and over the last few years has sustained a series of accidents and leaks. A cooling tower collapsed in 2007 and again in 2008. In 2009, the plant had three separate leaks of radioactive tritium, which has been linked to cancer. An investigation later established that the plant's owners had lied about the extent of contamination to the local water supply, claiming the facility did not have underground pipes that could carry tritium when it did. In a statement to the Associated Press, the company said it was committed to safe operations. \"Our focus has always been safely, securely and reliably operating our power plants. We take any concerns about the safe operation of our facilities very seriously and therefore finding the source of tritium in Vermont and correcting it is a top priority for our company,\" Entergy spokesman Mike Burns said in an email. Arnie Gundersen, a former industry engineer turned nuclear watchdog, said such leaks were indicators that the Vermont Yankee was nearing the end of its life span. \"It seems like the plants that came on line before the Three Mile Island accident in the 1970s are predominantly the ones that are spring the leaks,\" he said. \"In the case of the Vermont Yankee the problems of an ageing reactor were compounded by the pressures of trying to generate a 20% increase in power. Nobody else has ever tried for a power increase of 20%.\" Vermont has a reputation for environmental awareness – and for independence. The state has sent a socialist to the US Senate. However, the plant is a major source of employment, with jobs for about 600. But recent revelations about the leaks have consolidated public opinion in the state against the reactor. Last week, two conservation groups called for a criminal investigation into nuclear plant officials for misleading state officials when they testified under oath that the plant did not have the kind of underground pipes that carry tritium. On Sunday, the Burlington Free Press, the largest paper in the state, said it was time for the plant to go. \"Events such as a radioactive leak unresolved more than six weeks after it was first revealed to the public and misinformation provided by Entergy officials under oath raise serious questions about whether Vermont Yankee serves Vermont's long-term interests,\" the editorial said. Elsewhere, activists are hoping that the showdown over the Vermont Yankee will help mobilise protests against other reactors when their licences come up for review. Unlike in Vermont, however, most states require only that the federal government's nuclear regulatory commission sign off on extending the life of reactors. But James Moore of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group said he detected signs of a backlash against both the ageing reactors and Obama's plans for the birth of a third generation of nuclear plants. \"A lot of folks on the left and right are waking up to the reality that it is a bad idea to give hard earned tax dollars to a new generation of reactors when we can't manage the old reactors,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-un-north-korea-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-19T06:20:00Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un, 'great successor' poised to lead North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-un-north-korea-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-un-north-korea-leader","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un, 'great successor' poised to lead North Korea","bodyText":"Kim Jong-il's death has shifted the world's focus to his likely successor, his youngest son Kim Jong-un. If the planned succession proceeds without a hitch, the little-known, Swiss-educated Kim will be the leader of a nuclear state wracked by instability. Reports from North Korea said the country's 24 million people had already begun to rally round Kim Jong-un, who has been the communist state's leader-in-waiting for more than a year. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the country, people and military \"must faithfully revere respectable comrade Kim Jong-un. At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome today's difficulties.\" Little is known about Kim Jong-il's third son, who is believed to be in his late twenties; reports from Pyongyang suggest his ailing father had spent the past year grooming Kim Jong-un, whom the state media are now calling \"the great successor\" for leadership of the world's most isolated nation by taking him on \"field guidance\" trips around the country. The Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un is believed to have accompanied his father on a trip to China in May this year, apparently in an attempt to win support for his succession from Beijing, North Korea's only remaining ally and a major donor of aid. He is also reported to have travelled to China with his father in August 2010, when Kim senior - known as the \"Dear Leader\" - is thought to have met Chinese president Hu Jintao and appealed for diplomatic and financial support for his son's succession. North Korean state media have mentioned Jong-un in glowing terms, amid fears that his succession could meet with resistance from the upper ranks of the powerful Korean People's Army. It is possible that Kim Jong-un, who lacks the years of political experience his father enjoyed before becoming leader in 1994, will initially act as the figurehead of a regime run by influential members of the ruling party, according to Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul. \"Chances that the North Korean military is attempting a coup are very low, because North Korea has called itself a nation sharing a common destiny, Kim Jong-un,\" he said. \"I think the collective leadership of the party, government and military will go on for a while, because Kim Jong-un is still young.\" Yang said South Korea, which has put its military on high alert, would probably attempt to quickly establish a working relationship with the new leadership. \"Now, South Korea urgently needs to think of who in North Korea it has to deal with,\" he said. \"South Korea doesn't want any instability in North Korea, so will probably work to expand its co-operation efforts.\" South Korean media have reported that Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law and a trusted member of his inner circle, had been acting as a mentor to Kim Jong-un in anticipation of a more steady transition of power. But as it is, Kim senior, who suffered a stroke in 2008 and was reportedly ill with heart disease, died a year short of the centennial of the birth of his father, an event he was to mark by proclaiming his country a successful, modern state and a bona fide nuclear power. If the handover of power in North Korea, the world's only communist dynasty, proceeds as envisaged by Kim Jong-il, his son could be about to complete a rapid rise to prominence following his public debut in September last year. Then, he was awarded the rank of four-star general and made vice-chairman of the ruling Workers' party of Korea central military commission, a move analysts say was designed to place him at the centre of the country's power structure. If he does become the third member of his family to lead North Korea - his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founded the state in 1948 - Kim Jong-un will face immediate challenges. The regime had recently been seeking tens of thousands of tonnes of aid amid reports of serious food shortages this winter; a famine in the 1990s killed an estimated 1 million of North Korea's 23 million people. He will also face renewed pressure to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, sparked strict international sanctions that have placed the leadership under serious financial strain. Multiparty talks involving the two Koreas, China, the US, Russia and Japan have not been held since Pyongyang walked out of the process in April 2009. Last year it emerged that North Korea had built a uranium enrichment plant that could give it the ability to drastically strengthen its nuclear capability. It is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make between six and 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proved it has a working nuclear weapon. Kim Jong-il passed over his first and second sons as potential successors, but there are suggestions that he was never convinced that Kim Jong-un would make a successful leader. Early this year, his eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, told a Japanese newspaper that his father opposed continuing the family dynasty, but had named his youngest brother heir to maintain stability. In an interview with the Tokyo Shimbun, Kim Jong-nam said that hereditary succession \"does not fit with socialism, and my father was against it as well\". Kim Jong-nam fell out of favour with his father in 2001 after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \"My understanding is that [succession] was to stabilise the internal system. An unstable North Korea leads to instability in the region,\" he said in an interview in a southern Chinese city this month. In a country that, despite its communist doctrine, retains a Confucian respect for seniority, Kim Jong-un could have expected to give way to his older siblings, but reportedly emerged as his father's favourite after impressing him with his single-mindedness and leadership qualities. The leader-in-waiting, who shares his father's chubby frame, was educated at a Swiss boarding school, where he is said to have excelled at skiing and basketball, and learned to speak English, German and French. In a 2003 book, Kenji Fujimoto, a Japanese chef who worked as Kim Jong-il's personal cook before fleeing back to Japan, described Kim Jong-un as \"a chip off the old block, a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality\". Kim Jong-un's presence at North Korea's biggest-ever military parade, in Pyongyang in October last year, was taken by some to mean that he had been accepted by the leaders of the country's 1.2-million strong army. Kim Yong-hyun, an expert on North Korea at Seoul's Fdongguk University, said at the time.\" The parade served as a sign that the military has loyalty to the successor.\" It remains to be seen how the North Korean establishment and the country's impoverished people react to his possible accession. In leaked US embassy cables published by WikiLeaks last November, South Korean analysts warned the assistant secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, of possible instability arising from a botched succession. \"Of the five experts, one thought the younger Kim might succeed and one argued his lack of leadership experience made it unlikely he would win the support of the ruling elites,\" the cables said. They continued: \"They agreed that Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law Jang Song-taek would prove a strong rival for the younger Kim and would probably be tempted to challenge him. Kim Jong-il had used draconian controls and international aid to discourage coups after having foiled three such attempts in the late 90s.\" The cables referred to doubts about Kim Jong-un's ability to fend off challenges to his leadership in the event of his father's death. The experts noted that the younger Kim \"had very little experience and might not get much direct guidance before Kim Jong-il dies\". His father's sudden death, reportedly of heart failure while travelling by train on Saturday morning, has lent even more weight to doubts about his ability to quickly fill his father's shoes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/12/china-bullet-trains-recalled-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-12T13:56:59Z","webTitle":"Chinese bullet trains recalled in wake of fatal crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/12/china-bullet-trains-recalled-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/12/china-bullet-trains-recalled-crash","fields":{"headline":"Chinese bullet trains recalled in wake of fatal crash","bodyText":"A Chinese bullet train manufacturer has recalled 54 trains, in the latest sign that the government has launched an overhaul of the beleaguered high-speed rail network in the wake of last month's fatal crash. The hugely ambitious project was a matter of national prestige – evidence that China could build not only faster but, said officials, better than anyone else. But the disaster at Wenzhou in Zhejiang province killed 40 people and sparked an outpouring of public fury which focused not just on the safety of the line but also on the authorities' handling of events, with accusations that they were seeking to cover up problems. Many saw it as emblematic of the dangers of China's accelerated development. The recall is not directly linked to the collision, which involved trains made by a rival firm. The recalled trains are from the Beijing-Shanghai line, which launched on 1 July to mark the 90th anniversary of the Communist party – but has suffered repeated delays. But the announcement comes days after officials imposed a moratorium on new rail projects and the rail minister announced a reduction in train speeds. Experts believe it is part of a wider overhaul of the powerful railways ministry, which began when the minister – who championed the aggressive roll-out of high-speed rail – was ousted in February. He is expected to face corruption charges. State-owned China North Locomotive and Rolling Stock Ltd said the recall applied to model CRH380BL trains used on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Spokesman Tan Xiaofeng said experts will examine whether sensors are halting trains unnecessarily because they are faulty or too sensitive – for example being set off when a door is ajar or a passenger smokes in a toilet. \"When problems occur, we don't wish to hide them,\" he said. \"We put life before everything else.\" He said the line had suffered \"frequent quality problems\" due to components from American, European and domestic suppliers. Earlier this week, the company announced a temporary halt to production of the trains. Zhao Jian of Beijing Jiaotong University, a prominent critic of the expansion programme, said the recall and the cutting of train speeds would help rebuild confidence. \"I think the public will be less worried, at least less worried than if the speed was not slowed down,\" he said. \"In my eyes, this is the state council correcting the \"great leap\" by the last leadership of the ministry of railways … This is definitely a major step\". But he said there were a series of problems to be exposed, such as \"debt, technical safety and the fact that high-speed rail will not ease China's transportation difficulties and isn't suitable for China's economy\". Zhao said he believed the concerns about high-speed rail would ensure drastic reforms, with authorities likely to merge the ministry of railways into a transport super-ministry – as they tried to do several years ago, only to be thwarted by the rail ministry. Ren Xianfang, senior China economist for IHS Global Insight, said the Wenzhou disaster had convinced officials to \"rectify the excesses\" of its system. Ren likened the impact of the crash to the way that Fukushima had turned the Japanese public against nuclear power, adding: \"It is quite clear now that stepping on the brake is the only viable policy option.\" The days after the crash saw an extraordinary spate of bold reporting from Chinese media, who challenged the official response before they were reined in. China has the world's largest high-speed train network, rolled out at a frenetic pace. But critics argued even before the crash that the focus should be on expanding freight and lower-cost services that ordinary citizens could afford, rather than on prestigious high-tech projects. Safety concerns were also raised. Sun Zhang, a professor at the railway and urban mass transit research institute of Tongji University, told China Daily that he supported the idea of cutting train speeds, saying China should take time to test the system and gain experience. He said it took Japan almost half a century to increase the speed of its Shinkansen bullet train from 210 kilometres an hour [130mph] to 300kph. \"So it's impressive, and at the same time a bit worrisome, that China managed to achieve speeds of 350 kilometres an hour in just seven years,\" he added. Officials initially blamed the July crash on faulty signals equipment, but a senior investigator told the Beijing Times on Friday that the crash also exposed management failings and could have been avoided. \"There were serious flaws in the system design that led to an equipment failure,\" said Luo Lin, the minister of China's state administration of work safety. \"At the same time, this exposed problems in emergency response and safety management after the failure occurred. \"This was a major accident involving culpability that could have been totally avoided,\" he said.

Meanwhile, police in London staged the first of a series of raids on addresses linked to those detained. The Metropolitan police said four houses in east London had been searched. The five were arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which says a \"constable may arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist\". The investigation is at an early stage. Some past arrests by UK counter-terrorism officials have led to people being released without charge. The arrests have attracted considerable interest because they came hours after the announcement of the death of Osama bin Laden. The police say they are not \"at this stage\" connecting the arrests to the killing of the al-Qaida leader by US special forces, however. The men were detained at 4.32pm on Monday after a vehicle was stopped and checked by officers from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC), which polices the facility in west Cumbria. The five, all in their 20s and from London, were held in police custody overnight in Carlisle before being taken to Manchester in the morning, a spokesman for Cumbria police said. This morning, the investigation was taken over by the north-west counter-terrorism unit. One of the officers involved in the arrests believed the men were thought to have been filming near the nuclear plant. The police have not confirmed the ethnicity of the arrested men, though they are believed to be from a Muslim background . Greater Manchester police said the investigation was in its early stages and no further information would be released immediately. They were unaware of any connection to the death of Osama bin Laden in the US operation in Pakistan. Cumbria police said a road closure affected the area for \"a short period of time\". A spokeswoman for Sellafield confirmed that the five men had been arrested close to the site, saying: \"It is a security issue and our security people are having discussions.\" She said the plant had not been evacuated but the investigation had the potential to affect traffic. The sprawling coastal site is heavily protected by both private security guards and officers from the CNC, some of whom are armed. Sellafield is responsible for decommissioning and reprocessing nuclear waste and manufacturing fuel, on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The site has been operating since the 1940s, when it was used as a Royal Ordnance factory supporting the second world war effort. The site is also home to the world's first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, which operated from 1956 to 2003. Today the site comprises redundant buildings associated with early defence work, and operating facilities associated with the Magnox reprocessing programme, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp), the Sellafield Mox plant and a range of waste treatment plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/14/japan-approves-fukushima-nuclear-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-14T07:32:58Z","webTitle":"Japan cabinet approves Fukushima nuclear compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/14/japan-approves-fukushima-nuclear-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/14/japan-approves-fukushima-nuclear-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Japan cabinet approves Fukushima nuclear compensation","bodyText":"Japan's government has approved a plan to help the owners of the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant provide trillions of yen in compensation, but political manoeuvring could delay payments to tens of thousands of victims of the country's nuclear crisis. The cabinet's approval of the scheme on Tuesday came after the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], said a further six workers had exceeded the annual legal dose of radiation, underlining the risks they face as they struggle to stabilise overheating nuclear reactors by early next year. Shares in Tepco rose dramatically after the compensation scheme was approved, but anger is mounting at the slow progress made in paying families and businesses more than three months after the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Under the bill, the government would set up a fund and issue special bonds to enable Tepco to pay compensation that the Mainichi newspaper said could reach US$124bn (£75bn). Other power utilities would be asked to contribute to the fund, and Tepco is expected to repay the full sum over an, as yet, unspecified number of years. In return for state help, Tepco will have to cut costs and turn its management over to the government \"for a certain period of time\". Tepco, whose share price has fallen 90% since the 11 March tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant, promised to make repayments as quickly as possible. \"We hope that the proposed bill will be enacted in parliament as soon as possible,\" it said in a statement. The measure's fate is far from certain, however. Some government and opposition MPs oppose the use of public funds to help Tepco, and the prime minister, Naoto Kan, is still under pressure to resign immediately despite surviving a recent no-confidence motion by promising to step down once the crisis is under control. The current parliamentary session is due to end on 22 June, but the Kan administration is pushing to extend it in the hope of passing the compensation package, as well as an emergency budget to fund post-tsunami reconstruction. News that the bill had gained cabinet approval lifted investor confidence in Tepco, but concern persists that the company will look to consumers to help fund damages claims in the form of higher electricity bills. The trade and industry minister, Banri Kaieda, denied media reports that the government had already approved a 16% increase in electricity charges from next April. \"The government will make sure that any costs passed on to consumers will be kept to a minimum,\" he said. Tepco and two other power utilities are coming under pressure to end their involvement in nuclear power, with groups of investors expected to raise the issue at shareholders meetings at the end of the month. The risks facing the thousands of workers who have taken part in the operation to stabilise Fukushima Daiichi were underlined when Tepco said six more were feared to have exceeded the legal limit of 250 millisieverts [mSv] a year, bringing the total to eight. The limit was raised from 100mSv a year early in the crisis to allow workers to spend more time at the plant, where nuclear fuel in three reactors suffered meltdowns. In the worst cases, two control room workers were exposed to well over twice the legal limit, Tepco said, as it released preliminary results of radiation tests on almost 2,400 workers who were based at the plant in March, when radiation levels were at their highest. The health ministry also said on Monday that at least 90 others have exceeded the original limit of 100mSv, including several who are nearing the 250mSv level. Experts believe that exposure to more than 250mSv increases the chances of a person developing cancer in their lifetime by 1%. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear and safety agency, described the findings as \"extremely regrettable\". Tepco said none of those affected have showed signs of ill health, but added that they would need long-term monitoring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2011/feb/18/the-naked-and-famous-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-18T19:16:02Z","webTitle":"The Naked and Famous – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/18/the-naked-and-famous-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2011/feb/18/the-naked-and-famous-review","fields":{"headline":"The Naked and Famous – review","bodyText":"You have got to respect the Naked and Famous for choosing a name (lifted from a Tricky song) that inspires witticisms about their lack of fame.

If ever a band were made for the NME, it's this one: they combine the intimate boy/girl interplay of the xx, the stompalong electropop of MGMT and the dissonance of Nine Inch Nails – if they threw a bit of dubstep into the soup, they would be the composite 2011 \"indie\" band. Live, they sound a bit like all the above. The keening vocals of Alisa Xayalith, who sings lead with guitarist Thom Powers, give the music a touch of personality – without her, the set would have been a tangle of strobe lights, electronic glitchiness and distorted guitars. Over 45 minutes, they pull just enough tricks out of the hat to keep things reasonably interesting. Spank reproduces the sound of a nuclear power plant creaking to a halt: fuses blow, static rattles the amplifiers and the guitars muster a last screech of protest. A Wolf in Geek's Clothing (\"This is about shitheads on the internet,\" Powers semi-explains) uses cranked-up decibelage, interspersed with drowsy mumbling from Xayalith and Powers, to get its baleful message across in four head-spinning minutes.

The anti-nuclear movement to which I once belonged has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health. The claims we have made are ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged, and wildly wrong. We have done other people, and ourselves, a terrible disservice. I began to see the extent of the problem after a debate last week with Helen Caldicott. Dr Caldicott is the world's foremost anti-nuclear campaigner. She has received 21 honorary degrees and scores of awards, and was nominated for a Nobel peace prize. Like other greens, I was in awe of her. In the debate she made some striking statements about the dangers of radiation. So I did what anyone faced with questionable scientific claims should do: I asked for the sources. Caldicott's response has profoundly shaken me. First she sent me nine documents: newspaper articles, press releases and an advertisement. None were scientific publications; none contained sources for the claims she had made. But one of the press releases referred to a report by the US National Academy of Sciences, which she urged me to read. I have now done so – all 423 pages. It supports none of the statements I questioned; in fact it strongly contradicts her claims about the health effects of radiation. I pressed her further and she gave me a series of answers that made my heart sink – in most cases they referred to publications which had little or no scientific standing, which did not support her claims or which contradicted them. (I have posted our correspondence, and my sources, on my website.) I have just read her book Nuclear Power Is Not the Answer. The scarcity of references to scientific papers and the abundance of unsourced claims it contains amaze me. For the last 25 years anti-nuclear campaigners have been racking up the figures for deaths and diseases caused by the Chernobyl disaster, and parading deformed babies like a medieval circus. They now claim 985,000 people have been killed by Chernobyl, and that it will continue to slaughter people for generations to come. These claims are false. The UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (Unscear) is the equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Like the IPCC, it calls on the world's leading scientists to assess thousands of papers and produce an overview. Here is what it says about the impacts of Chernobyl. Of the workers who tried to contain the emergency at Chernobyl, 134 suffered acute radiation syndrome; 28 died soon afterwards. Nineteen others died later, but generally not from diseases associated with radiation. The remaining 87 have suffered other complications, including four cases of solid cancer and two of leukaemia. In the rest of the population there have been 6,848 cases of thyroid cancer among young children – arising \"almost entirely\" from the Soviet Union's failure to prevent people from drinking milk contaminated with iodine 131. Otherwise \"there has been no persuasive evidence of any other health effect in the general population that can be attributed to radiation exposure\". People living in the countries affected today \"need not live in fear of serious health consequences from the Chernobyl accident\". Caldicott told me that Unscear's work on Chernobyl is \"a total cover-up\". Though I have pressed her to explain, she has yet to produce a shred of evidence for this contention. In a column last week, the Guardian's environment editor, John Vidal, angrily denounced my position on nuclear power. On a visit to Ukraine in 2006, he saw \"deformed and genetically mutated babies in the wards … adolescents with stunted growth and dwarf torsos; foetuses without thighs or fingers\". What he did not see was evidence that these were linked to the Chernobyl disaster. Professor Gerry Thomas, who worked on the health effects of Chernobyl for Unscear, tells me there is \"absolutely no evidence\" for an increase in birth defects. The National Academy paper Dr Caldicott urged me to read came to similar conclusions. It found that radiation-induced mutation in sperm and eggs is such a small risk \"that it has not been detected in humans, even in thoroughly studied irradiated populations such as those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\". Like Vidal and many others, Caldicott pointed me to a book which claims that 985,000 people have died as a result of the disaster. Translated from Russian and published by the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, this is the only document that looks scientific and appears to support the wild claims made by greens about Chernobyl. A devastating review in the journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry points out that the book achieves this figure by the remarkable method of assuming that all increased deaths from a wide range of diseases – including many which have no known association with radiation – were caused by the Chernobyl accident. There is no basis for this assumption, not least because screening in many countries improved dramatically after the disaster and, since 1986, there have been massive changes in the former eastern bloc. The study makes no attempt to correlate exposure to radiation with the incidence of disease. Its publication seems to have arisen from a confusion about whether Annals was a book publisher or a scientific journal. The academy has given me this statement: \"In no sense did Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences or the New York Academy of Sciences commission this work; nor by its publication do we intend to independently validate the claims made in the translation or in the original publications cited in the work. The translated volume has not been peer reviewed by the New York Academy of Sciences, or by anyone else.\" Failing to provide sources, refuting data with anecdote, cherry-picking studies, scorning the scientific consensus, invoking a cover-up to explain it: all this is horribly familiar. These are the habits of climate-change deniers, against which the green movement has struggled valiantly, calling science to its aid. It is distressing to discover that when the facts don't suit them, members of this movement resort to the follies they have denounced. We have a duty to base our judgments on the best available information. This is not only because we owe it to other people to represent the issues fairly, but also because we owe it to ourselves not to squander our lives on fairytales. A great wrong has been done by this movement. We must put it right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/the-lay-scientist/2011/apr/06/1","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-06T11:38:00Z","webTitle":"Guardian readers 'fix' the Fukushima power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/apr/06/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/apr/06/1","fields":{"headline":"Guardian readers 'fix' the Fukushima power plant","bodyText":"As a hip, 29-year-old man-about-town, I often fall asleep at night in front of BBC News 24. This means that my dreams often contain more current affairs content than other people's. After one episode of Newsnight last week I woke up in the middle of a picnic in Fortnum and Mason's, when my Mum unexpectedly turned into a zombie version of New Statesman's Laurie Penny and started beating me over the head with a tin of caviar. Dreams can be useful though. Some of the world's most reputable websites, like increasebrainpower.com, claim that if you sleep on a problem, you're reasonably likely to wake up with a solution. So what if I could harness this power to solve issues in the news? One opportunity to do this came with the recent Japanese earthquake and tsunami, a natural disaster which killed tens of thousands of people in Japan, resulted in a critical emergency at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and most catastrophically of all for Daily Mail readers led to the detection of trace quantities of radioactive material near Oxfordshire. The crisis at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant raged for weeks, with the main challenge being to find \"the best ways to make the plant safe again.\" The answer came to me during a mid-Question Time nap last week – with the Space Shuttles recently decommissioned, surely we could use them to lift the damaged reactors into space, where they could explode in peace without causing harm to any people or wildlife, or unsettling the residents of Oxfordshire? As long as we tugged them in the opposite direction from the space station, I couldn't really see a problem with this plan. If only there were some way for ordinary, unqualified members of the public with interesting ideas, but no actual experience or knowledge of how nuclear reactors work, to have their opinions published in a serious forum for the benefit of the energy industry and mankind. And then something brilliant happened. The Guardian finally decided to step in and ask its readers for help: \"Fukushima nuclear crisis: Send us your ideas for stopping radiation leaks.\" Their plea continued: \"The Fukushima plant remains in a critical condition and solutions to immediate problems are not forthcoming. That's why we're looking for your views on the best ways to make the plant safe again. In particular, we're looking for opinions from experts with knowledge of the nuclear industry, but whether you're an engineer in the field, an academic, or a nuclear plant worker, we'd like to hear from you.\" Adding on the form, \"please be as brief as possible,\" because the last thing you need in a crisis like this is a complicated solution. Oddly my idea wasn't accepted, but many others were, representing some of the finest minds ever to have graced the Comment is Free forums. Todd: \"Build the worlds biggest tank over the whole site with pre-fab tilt slab concrete. [...] I have done similar projects on a smaller scale but not with nuclear waste.\" Weston, Nuclear Radiologist: \"repair the reacters befor any thing else bad happiens\" Andrew, Inventor: \"water problem is un-fixable. Stop trying. Let it run off into the Pacific.\" Hugh, Geology Student: \"I would use explosive materials to detach the Fukushima plant from the main land, use air-bags to float it 50km out into the pacific and then sink the whole lot 7000m down to the bottom of the Japan Trench.\" Max: \"I suggest removing radioactive contamination there by using a small controlled explosion of a specially engineered nuclear device at the site of the stricken Fukushima plant\" OmegaSector: \"IN FUTURE, ALL NEW NUCLEAR REACTOR MUST BE BUILT OVER A 1.2 km hole. Any out of control reactor, one press of a buttom and boom, the reactor will fail down 1.2 km and then seal up with soil.\" Denny, Assistant to Dr Strangelove: \"Small scale nuclear strike.\" Kevin: \"Japan has over 30,000 suicides per year — that's over 80 per day. Since these people are planning to kill themselves anyway, how about the government asking for volunteers to go in, fix piping, visually inspect the damage, etc..?\" Not Einstein: \"friendly radiation... to probably cancel out its effects. Its more like injecting good cholesterols to fight off bad ones in your body. I am not versed in these nuclear technicalities but I do understand philosophy of things, and sometimes you just need to fight fire with fire.\" ChemtrailsUK, I LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS: \"They should have got that expert that's was on Alex Jones show. And did what He said ages ago to surround it in cadmium rods to atract the plutonium then cover in sand or quarts then as is melts into glass cover that in cement. Its way to late now. 1000 times Safety 1km out to sea of fukushima. No more sea food for me.\" Harry: Moor a large tanker along side the plant. Flood the hull with water. With a large crane lift the problem reactor cores into the flooded hull, where the water will keep them cool for as long as it takes to sail the hull to a deep ocean trench and sink it. Jon: Clearly, radioactive material such as Cesium, with a lifetime of 600 years, and Plutonium, which lasts many times longer than human history, should not be produced. It is a crime against humanity and life itself to do so. And, er, so on. Now to be fair to the Guardian, it's great that they tried to apply crowd-sourcing to journalism in an unusual and innovative way, and some of the suggestions offered were more sensible, and in at least one case vaguely approximated the fix that was actually applied yesterday. But the thing is, as much as I love you all, I'm not going to ask for your help dealing with a nuclear disaster, because most of you, like me, don't have a clue. And yet there's this odd, growing trend in the world today, fed by endless news vox-pops and the general 'X-Factorization' of television, that somehow everyone's opinions are valuable and worth listening to. Bollocks. As the late, great comedian George Carlin once said, \"think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize half of 'em are stupider than that.\" 95% of the ideas that run through our heads are moronic, as the internet basically proves. If you want to know how to fix a power plant, or do brain surgery, or predict the effects of climate change, then ask an actual expert. Because no amount of hot air balloons can save a bad idea.

One: reproduction. Two: best not mentioned, really…","bodyText":"There are certain subjects – GM, nuclear power, climate change – that cause aeration in scientific circles. And, as president elect of the American College of Surgeons Lazar Greenfield found out recently, the reputed antidepressant effects of semen are also a subject to be treated with care. In his Valentine's Day-themed editorial in Surgery News, \"Gut Feelings\", Lazar cited a study that reported the mood-boosting effects of semen on women, concluding: \"So there's a deeper bond between men and women than St Valentine would have suspected, and now we know there's a better gift for that day than chocolate.\" Greenfield's Andy Gray moment offended many ACS members and he was accused of sexism; demonstrations were threatened. Greenfield is a highly respected retired professor emeritus of surgery at the University of Michigan with what has been described as \"a reputation for supporting women in surgery\" and he is also the inventor of the Greenfield Filter, a device that prevents blood clots. Confronted with the furore he'd caused, Greenfield apologised and gave up his editorship of Surgery News. Two weeks ago the controversy over what had become known as \"Semengate\" hadn't gone away, so he also resigned from his ACS position. Greenfield told the Detroit Free Press: \"I was short-sighted in not anticipating the potential for my remark to be misinterpreted… I thought [these were] fascinating new findings related to semen, and the way in which nature is trying to promote a stronger bond between men and women. It impressed me. It seemed as though it was a gift from nature. And so that was the reason for my lighthearted comments.\" The study he was referring to was in fact published back in 2002 by Gordon Gallup, a psychologist at SUNY-Albany. His team found that women whose partners didn't use condoms were less depressed. They also found that depressive symptoms and suicide attempts were higher among women who used condoms regularly compared to those who didn't. Moreover, the women who didn't use condoms became more depressed the longer they went without having sex. Gallup suggested this was because semen contains oestrogen and prostaglandins which have been linked to lower levels of depression, and oxytocin which promotes social bonding. Gallup's study came with an important caveat: \"I want to make it clear that we are not advocating that people abstain from using condoms. Clearly an unwanted pregnancy or a sexually transmitted disease would more than offset any advantageous psychological effects of semen.\" Last week, his research back in the news, Gallup elaborated to Popular Science: \"Seminal plasma evolved to control and manipulate the female reproductive system so as to work toward the best interests of the donor – the male.\" He suggested that the possible antidepressant properties of semen may promote bonding between the sexual partners, and that was to the male's reproductive advantage. Asked about the controversy Greenfield's remarks had caused, Gallup commented: \"I think it's a tragic overreaction. The point at which we begin to let political agenda dictate what science is all about is the point when science ceases to be a viable enterprise.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/18/japan-womens-world-cup-reaction-joy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-18T12:30:01Z","webTitle":"Women's World Cup victory brings joy to Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/18/japan-womens-world-cup-reaction-joy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/18/japan-womens-world-cup-reaction-joy","fields":{"headline":"Women's World Cup victory brings joy to Japan","bodyText":"The Japanese have had precious little to cheer about over the past four months, so they could be forgiven for the enthusiasm with which they greeted a historic victory in a football match played in the dead of night thousands of miles and several time zones away. The celebrations began as soon as Saki Kumagai smacked the ball high into the net to seal victory over the USA in the Women's World Cup final in Germany in the early hours of Monday morning. Supporters filed out of bars in Tokyo and chanted the team's name on the streets in scenes reminiscent of the men's World Cup in South Africa last summer, when Japan confounded their critics and reached the knockout stage. Many more had set their alarms in time for the 3.45am kick-off, secure in the knowledge they could watch the match live and then go back to bed, as sunrise marked the start of a national holiday. For those who had chosen to sleep though the final, TV networks ran endless replays of the match's highlights, culminating in the nerve-jangling penalty shootout that resulted when the match, played in front of 50,000 fans at the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, ended 2-2 after extra time. Newspapers rushed to distribute special editions to mark the occasion. \"Nadeshiko, the world number ones!\" read a headline in the Asahi Shimbun, referring to the team's nickname, a frilled pink carnation that supposedly symbolises the beauty and grace of an \"ideal\" Japanese woman. In wartime, the term \"Yamato Nadeshiko\" was used to describe women who displayed the traditional virtue of silent sacrifice in the nation's cause, an etymology that seems a little at odds with the fearless exploits of their modern-day footballing counterparts. All but the most loyal Nadeshiko devotees were expecting the Americans to lift the World Cup for a third time against a side to whom they had not lost in 25 previous meetings. With an average height of just 1.62 metres, the Japanese were far smaller than their opponents, but what they lacked in stature they made up for in tenacity and teamwork, qualities that led one commentator to liken them to the current Barcelona team. The victory – the first time an Asian team has won a world football tournament at any level – provided momentary respite from the aftermath of the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, and the continuing crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In what proved an inspired piece of sports psychology, the team's [male] coach, Norio Sasaki, had shown them footage of the disaster before their previous two wins against Germany and Sweden. \"My girls played their hearts out,\" Sasaki said in a TV interview after the final whistle. \"We could feel the energy coming from everyone back in Japan watching on TV. I'm stunned.\" The mother of Homare Sawa, Japan's captain, said: \"I felt the whole of Japan smile.\" The team, aware of the added dimension to the result, unfurled a banner that read: \"To our friends around the world. Thank you for your support.\" Akino Yoshihara, a translator from Kyoto who is more accustomed to following the men's football team, said: \"I always felt the players had the confidence to win. I'm not sure how much the tsunami factored into their performance, but they never gave up, and it's that attitude that will help us through the aftermath of the disaster.\" Miho Kajioka, a football fan from Tokyo, said: \"I don't think this will make people forget about the disaster, but at the same time we haven't had a single piece of good news for the past four months. \"It's as if we had nothing to be hopeful about, so in that sense the result is great. It's incredible.\" Japan's opponents were gracious in defeat. \"I truly believe that something bigger was pulling for this team,\" the US goalkeeper Hope Solo said. In Washington, Barack Obama, who had watched the match on TV with his family at their official residence, congratulated the Japanese in a Twitter post: \"Congratulations to Japan, women's World Cup champions,\" he said, adding that he \"couldn't be prouder of the women of [the US national team] after a hard-fought game\". But the most effusive praise came from Junji Ogura, president of the Japanese football association. \"The players have showed the brilliance of Japanese women,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/28/fukushima-radiation-fears-children-monitors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-28T12:26:39Z","webTitle":"Fukushima radiation fears: children near nuclear plant to be given monitors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/28/fukushima-radiation-fears-children-monitors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/28/fukushima-radiation-fears-children-monitors","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima radiation fears: children near nuclear plant to be given monitors","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of children living near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are to be given personal radiation monitors, as concern grows over the long-term health effects of exposure to radiation. Dosimeters will be given to 34,000 children aged between four and 15 living in Fukushima city, 45 miles from the plant, after abnormally high radiation readings were recorded in the area. The risks posed by radiation from the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl have already driven 80,000 people from homes within 12 miles of the plant. Many of the child evacuees from communities that now lie empty attend schools in Fukushima, a city of 300,000 people. Local authorities have provided monitors to schools outside the exclusion zone, but this is the first time they have been supplied to individual pupils. Data from the dosimeters will be analysed to assess the risks posed by cumulative radiation exposure. The move, the latest concession to growing parental anger over patchy official information about the risks of radiation exposure, came as the company that operates the plant faced repeated verbal attacks at a rowdy annual shareholders' meeting in Tokyo. More than 9,000 investors attended the meeting, held at a hotel under heavy police guard, with many berating Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] executives over their response to the 11 March tsunami, which crashed into the plant and knocked out vital cooling systems to reactors. The crisis has knocked 85% off the value of Tepco shares and resulted in annual losses of $15bn (£9.4bn). The company also faces a compensation bill that could exceed $100bn, while a government plan to help fund damages claims has yet to be put to a parliamentary vote. The executives got a more sympathetic hearing from others at the meeting, however, and late on Tuesday afternoon, institutional investors helped vote down a motion by activist shareholders to force Tepco to scrap its nuclear reactors. The company's new chairman, Tsunehisa Katsumata, opened the meeting with an apology for the accident. \"We are working to get out of this crisis as quickly as possible,\" he said. But his attempts to answer questions were punctuated by heckles and demands for him and the rest of the Tepco board to resign. One man demanded that the utility's executives \"jump into the reactors and die\", while another said that in feudal times they would have been expected to commit ritual disembowelment. The meeting was held the same day that Japan's nuclear safety agency said about 15 tonnes of low-level radioactive water had leaked into the ground from the Fukushima plant. Tepco, which is struggling to deal with huge volumes of contaminated water that have built up during the operation to cool damaged reactors, said it was investigating the cause of the leak. In Fukushima city, a local official said children would be required to wear their dosimeters for three months. \"We are still considering whether to expand the programme to include other residents,\" said Koichi Kato. The government says radiation levels in the city remain well below those considered dangerous, but dozens of schools lying outside the official exclusion zone have taken extra precaution to protect children. In some towns, authorities have limited the time children are allowed to pay outside and moved swimming lessons from outdoor pools to sports centres. Many have removed layers of radioactive topsoil from their playgrounds, often at the request of anxious parents. Anti-nuclear campaigners said Fukushima city's move did not go far enough. \"The meters don't protect children from radiation, they simply measure exposure after a certain amount of time,\" said Aileen Mioko Smith of Green Action. \"Children should be moved out of areas where radiation levels are high, not used as guinea pigs.\" Last week, a coalition of civic and environmental groups in the Fukushima area issued an emergency petition demanding the evacuation of children and pregnant women from radiation hot spots outside the exclusion zone. \"Since atmospheric radiation levels show no sign of abating, the inhabitants of heavily contaminated areas will continue to endure high radiation doses, both externally and internally,\" they said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-17T00:00:06Z","webTitle":"Obama's risky nuclear renaissance | Kate Sheppard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Obama's risky nuclear renaissance","bodyText":"In his first state of the union address last month, Barack Obama declared that creating new clean energy jobs \"means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country\". The following week, his administration proposed tripling the amount of money available for loan guarantees for nuclear power, to $54.5bn. And today, the administration took the next logical step in their plan to kick-start the nuclear revival in the United States, announcing that they will award the first loan to two new reactors in Burke County, Georgia – marking the first expansion of nuclear power in the United States in three decades. The Obama administration's big payouts to the nuclear industry will be essential for expanding nuclear power; the industry has made it clear that there will be no nuclear renaissance unless the US taxpayer foots the bill. The economics of the nuclear industry are so dicey that Wall Street, no strangers to high-risk investments, have for years refused to finance new plants unless the government underwrites the deal. The nuclear industry has made its reliance on the taxpayer clear. \"Without loan guarantees we will not build nuclear power plants,\" Michael J Wallace, co-chief executive of UniStar Nuclear and vice president of Constellation Energy, told the New York Times in 2007. A major part of the problem in soliciting investments is the price tag, which just keeps growing. While the nuclear industry as recently as 2005 claimed the price tag for a reactor was $2bn, independent estimates say the cost could be as high as $12bn per reactor. The proposal to encourage nuclear construction via massive federally backed loans creates a major risk for the US taxpayer. A 2003 study from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the risk of default on the government-backed loans is \"very high – well above 50%\". In addition to cost, there have been significant concerns about the proposed designs for new reactors around the country. The Georgia plant selected for the first award is no stranger to these problems. The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design, proposed for the Georgia site and six other sites around the country was sent back to the drawing board after federal regulators last October discovered major safety concerns in the design proposal, with regulators noting that it would not sufficiently protect the reactor from earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and airplane crashes. The DOE loans are conditional at this point, awaiting approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Other proposed reactors in this promised nuclear revival would use a design from French nuclear power company Areva that nuclear regulators in France, Finland, and the United Kingdom have said has \"a significant and fundamental nuclear safety problem\" with its instrumentation and control system. Westinghouse is expected to submit a new design proposal this month, but without that new proposal it's difficult to even put an accurate price tag on the project. The last estimate for the two Georgia reactors provided by Southern Company was $14bn. The head of Georgia Power Co, a subsidiary of Southern, has noted that the actual cost of the reactors will likely vary widely from original projections, but the company shouldn't be required to disclose changes to projected costs regularly. The conditional loan guarantee from the Department of Energy is for $8.3bn. It's worth noting that the two reactors already on the Georgia site, completed in the 1980s, had huge price overruns; though initially estimated at $1bn, the final price was almost $9bn. The government backing of the Georgia project is a major financial gamble, but the White House seems to see it as worth the risk politically. Last week Obama told reporters that his embrace of nuclear power is part of an effort to adopt some Republican ideas on energy, adding that he remains an \"eternal optimist\" about bipartisanship. The case the administration has made is that they will give Republicans more nuclear power, offshore oil and gas drilling, and incentives for coal, if they will accept a cap on carbon emissions and investments in renewable energy. But so far his entreaties have been met with a resounding \"No\" from the right, which maintains that he is \"anti-nuclear\". The $54bn in tax-payer dollars they've put on the line would indicate otherwise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/mar/27/climate-policies-lower-energy-bills","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-27T17:17:55Z","webTitle":"Will the UK's climate policies really help to lower energy bills?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/27/climate-policies-lower-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/27/climate-policies-lower-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"Will the UK's climate policies really help to lower energy bills?","bodyText":"It is welcome news that the government has recognised that it must be honest and \"transparent\" with the public about the impact of its policies on energy bills. Without this, the misinformation and scaremongering over green taxes, etc, will not just continue largely uncontested but magnify, too. But despite the depth of detail it has provided in its new analysis, I still feel the conclusions presented today need to be taken with a fistful of salt. How can we take anyone too seriously when they try to state with any degree of certainty - even if based on three scenarios - what energy prices will be seven years from now, let alone 17 years from now? Yes, we can determine a likely trend but precise forecasts such as \"£166 by 2020\" are quickly smothered by caveats and smallprint. Not only are fuel prices near impossible to forecast in the current climate - beyond making the safe bet that they will continue to head north in the short-to-medium term - but we also have to consider all the other variables, too, not least the ever-shifting political sands, not just here in the UK, but across the EU and beyond. It is, therefore, tremendously hard to answer with clarity and certainty the headline question of whether climate policies will help to lower energy bills. What we do seem to have established today, though, is that to reduce the rise of energy bills - as opposed to actually reducing them - then householders (and businesses) will need to invest in as many energy efficiency measures and new A+++-rated products as possible. Which, of course, will come at a cost. Again, it's next to impossible to work out if that will achieve a net reduction in spending on energy bills overall. However, it is at least pleasing to see the government offer more - to use the in-vogue term - granularity about the precise impacts of each of its policies on today's energy bills. Hopefully, this will help to becalm a febrile debate that produces a lot of heat but little in the way of light. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, says: All serious projections show that our energy bills are likely to keep rising. Consumers have had to weather any number of energy price storms over recent years, and although the ‘cushion’ effect set out by Decc is welcome, consumers need something more substantial to soften the impact of continually rising energy prices. Government policies will provide consumers with a level of protection compared with a ‘do-nothing approach’, however consumers are looking for a ‘do more strategy’. It is almost universally acknowledged that the best strategy to reduce energy costs is to create more energy efficient homes. Consumer Focus has argued that government should use the billions they will raise in carbon taxes to deliver a more ambitious programme to insulate our homes to higher standards, saving the poorest in society money on their bills, cutting carbon emissions and creating economic growth quickly and across the country. Reducing demand is quicker, cheaper, more sustainable and solves the problem at source. Also, while we have to bring on new and cleaner generation plant which loosens our dependence on fossil imports, we have to focus on how we pay for the new investment. The trend is for bill payers, rather than tax payers or shareholders, to take the burden and risk. We must question whether that is right, and government should commit to the least regressive way to fund energy investment. Dustin Benton of the Green Alliance has some thoughts on the high proportion of savings attributed by Decc to \"products policy\": Decc’s analysis that bills will come down depends heavily on assumptions about ‘products policy’, which is delivered through the EU’s ecodesign directive. In fact, products policy is the single largest source of bill savings – more than four times greater than the Green Deal and ECO. Our report, Cutting Britain’s Energy Bill, suggested that 40% of the savings expected from products policy might not happen. This is because implementation of ecodesign regulations has been painfully slow, and many regulations have been watered down. But it’s also because few people are actually buying efficient appliances in a recession. One way to fix this is through an efficiency feed-in tariff, which the government could introduce easily in the energy bill. This would incentivise people to purchase efficient appliances, and would be funded from the savings made by not building as many new power stations. Because new power stations cost between £80-150/MWh, and efficiency programmes save energy at a cost of £20-35/MWh, it makes economic (and environmental) sense to pay people to save energy, rather than building new power stations. Katharine Knox from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has left a comment below which is certainly worth reading because it highlights the \"triple injustice\" of the impact of government policy on energy bills: ...the lowest income households pay more, benefit less from policies and are responsible for the least emissions Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist and policy director, says: Costs of energy are likely to go up in the future whatever government chooses to do, because international fossil fuel prices are increasing. Some media reporting has given the impression that there is a magic answer which will deal simultaneously with the three issues of security, environmental protection and affordability. Candidates for these magic bullets have included a ‘dash for gas’, shale gas or new nuclear power. The reality is that none will. Decc's analysis on impact on bills is not inconsistent with findings from Climate Change Committee which indicate that policy costs are not unmanageable, and that costs of a gas-based approach could be hundreds of pounds greater in future decades. So, although not part of the Decc report, it needs to be stressed that ignoring climate commitments now risks very high costs later. The strategy underlying the Decc policy is that additional short-term costs associated with green energy and carbon prices is offset by efficiency meaning that bills are kept down. So Greenpeace has long advocated the economic as well as environmental benefits of efficiency policy. However, keeping bills as well under control as possible requires a more pro-active approach. Government should accept amendments to the energy bill which tackle power wastage and inefficiency. And if the carbon floor price is to be continued, use the receipts to drive energy efficiency through the building stock because the lamentably poor quality of our building stock (UK has ‘the oldest and worst housing stock in Europe’), and that energy wastage that is a strategic national issue. Carbon Brief has posted its own detailed analysis of Decc's predictions for future energy bills. Like others, it doesn't seem hugely impressed: Ed Davey told Carbon Brief yesterday that the government's predictions on the savings its policy measures will deliver are \"conservative\" and \"on the cautious side\". But the Green Deal has been heavily criticised as over-expensive and over-complex. At the very least, it's a very new policy, and questions hang over what kinds of energy savings it will actually deliver. DECC's argument is that although bills are going to go up regardless, we'll be better off with their policies than without them. The various parts of their projections are somewhat confusing, but essentially it comes down to quite a simple question - can the government's energy efficiency policies deliver? Today, the Times is skeptical, and gets to the key issue - can the government deliver the energy efficiency measures it needs to in order to see a net reduction in energy bills? The paper quotes Andrew Warren of the Association for the Conservation of Energy, who says: \"Of course these savings are do-able. But are we on target? It's not desperately clear that we are. The calculations assume that new products are purchased and that people do not stagger on with their old boiler. It's quite difficult to see what the stimulus will be to deliver these savings.\" Energy is likely to get more expensive in the future whatever happens. But if the government can't encourage us to reduce the amount of energy we use, there won't be much to limit the effect of future price hikes. Reuters is reporting some analysis published today in a \"research note\" by the investment bank Liberum Capital: Some analysts doubted the government figures, saying Decc's reduction figures were hard to measure and that installation costs for energy efficiency measures had not been included. \"The reductions are virtually all down to energy efficiency measures, the impact of which are not certain, whereas the increases are pretty much guaranteed, and these calculations do not include the cost to the consumer of installing the energy efficiency measures,\" Liberum Capital said in a research note. \"The concern is that when bills really start to ramp up, future governments will renege on the returns promised to developers. This is exactly what happened in Spain, Italy,\" the investment bank said. The London Evening Standard has just published an editorial on \"eye-watering energy bills\", which refers to Decc's analysis: The government has muddied the waters by suggesting that its environmental energy policies will mean lower prices. Yet these assorted levies at present add nearly 10%, or an average of £112, to bills. The savings from green energy will only come into effect by 2020 — and then only if families use all the energy-saving devices the government recommends. But not every household will have such appliances as fuel-efficient boilers and smart meters. And those who rent their homes may find their landlords unwilling to invest in energy-efficiency measures. Low-carbon electricity is a worthy goal but ministers should be open about the costs. Meanwhile consumers are squeezed inexorably by ever-rising fuel bills, while energy companies — many of them foreign-owned — pile on profits. It’s not quite how the Tories’ original dream of a competitive energy market was meant to work— and it rankles even more in the cold. Here are the thoughts of Nick Molho, head of climate &amp; energy policy at WWF-UK: Today’s announcement by Decc highlights the importance of pursuing strong policies to both drastically improve energy efficiency in our economy and decarbonise our grid at the same time. Both have to be pursued with the same degree of urgency and the energy bill should have a crucial role to play here by providing clear long-term commitments on both power sector decarbonisation and energy efficiency. As made clear by a recent report from Cambridge Econometrics, supporting the deployment of renewable energy technologies such as offshore wind over the next 20 years could significantly boost UK GDP, increase employment, reduce dependencies on gas imports and significantly reduce the power sector’s carbon emissions compared to going down the route of another dash for gas. Guy Newey, head of environment and energy at the right-leaning thinktank Policy Exchange, has sent me his reaction: The government is taking some sensible measures to help people who are struggling with bills, although we have to be very cautious about whether products policy will deliver the huge level of savings Decc expects and whether the poorest consumers can afford new white goods. But introducing good policies should not be an excuse for bad policies that push up bills unnecessarily. It is fair to expect government to cut carbon emissions as cost-effectively as possible. However, many of the current measures, in particular support for some very expensive renewables through the Renewables Obligation and now Contracts For Difference fail that test. And because of the way costs for new technologies are passed through energy bills, the poorest are clobbered the hardest. Those households who do not benefit from any insulation measures will be hardest hit (See Chart 13, p. 37). It is also worth stressing that while the average bills will go down, bills for most households will be higher. This is because houses that benefit from insulation measures will see large reductions in bills bringing down the mean average. This underlines the importance of energy efficiency policies like the Green Deal working. The government’s justification for its policies is also heavily dependent on projections for future gas prices. Gas has certainly risen over the past 10 years, but comparing today’s price with the troughs of 2007 and 2010 is a little selective (Chart 6 on p.22 shows that if you took other dates in recent years, gas prices have fallen). The only honest response is that we have no idea what gas prices will be in seven years, and should design policy that can react to sudden changes while still meeting carbon targets. David Powell, Friends of the Earth's economics campaigner, has sent me his detailed analysis: There are a few fairly large elephants in Decc's analysis - both in terms of methodology and the assumptions they have about savings. By constructing a counterfactual universe in which their policies didn't exist and comparing bills to that, they allow cynical critics to hammer them on the costs and poke holes in their assumptions about savings. Rather than trying to justify the precise figures Decc has used - which we, too, would probably say are imperfect - it's more appropriate to look at the bigger picture. So yes, there are going to be higher short-term costs for investing in clean energy and upfront costs of energy saving. We need to massively invest in our creaking dirty energy system: better for our economy, bills and the climate in the long run, but requiring a bit of effort now. Picking on the costs alone ignores the employment, macroeconomic, environmental and energy security benefits of getting off fossil fuels. And if the government gives investors more confidence - for example, by committing in the Energy Bill to a 2030 decarbonisation target for electricity - then the costs of capital will be lower, which is good for all of our bills. The question is really not 'do the savings add up', but 'are the policies the right ones', given that we know we need to invest in alternatives to fossil fuels, and that gas has ramped up bills in recent years. Some are better than others. Subsidising renewables in the short-term to get them to the point of being truly competitive with fossil fuels that have benefitted from a century of subsidy is the right thing to do. But increasing carbon taxes without using the money received for 'green' ends, in particular, home energy efficiency, is more questionable. Fossil fuels are pushing our bills up (wholesale price of energy has increased by 68% in last three years) and there's no real chance of prices falling, so whichever way you look at it we need to do much more energy saving. Are the government's energy saving policies right? Perhaps not. Its Green Deal scheme is singularly failing to set the world alight, and by ending the (taxpayer funded) Warm Front scheme that gave grants for home insulation, and replacing it with the (billpayer funded) overstretched Energy Company Obligation, the government has reduced support for those on the lowest incomes - who are most at risk of rising bills. A neat way to square the circle of all this would be to take the revenues from the EU ETS and its UK underlay, the Carbon Price Floor, and recycle it to households to make hundreds of thousands of homes fuel poverty proof, for good. Here's a snapshot of what people have been saying on Twitter... Ed Davey has written a comment piece for the Daily Telegraph: Some people think climate change policies on things like wind farms are what are behind high bills. But they couldn’t be more wrong. The biggest single thing driving bills higher is global oil and gas prices. They have been rising remorselessly, fuelled by demand in growing economies like China. They’re likely to keep rising. The government can’t control the global market and drive down international wholesale prices. What we can do is try to drive a wedge between global prices and the cost of bills. Through investment in domestic sources of low carbon energy like nuclear, wind and wave power, and other renewables, we are helping to insulate the public from volatile fossil fuel prices in the future. The reforms we are making to the electricity market will help incentivise £110 billion investment from the private sector, with a focus on home-grown clean energy infrastructure. Through the Green Deal we are encouraging people to improve their homes and save energy. Saving energy means lower bills. Decc admits that \"the large majority of households are expected to achieve savings through Products Policy, Building Regulations and Smart Meters\". In fact, look at Annex F and you see these are the policies where the bulk of the savings come from by 2020. (It's perhaps worth noting that these are largely policies initiated and driven forward by the previous government and the EU, as opposed to the current government.) Therefore, the savings are, in large part, based on households replacing - at a not insignificant cost - inefficient tumble driers, TVs, fridges, etc, with new energy efficient ones in the intervening period (what it calls \"Products Policy\"). It also seems to assume households will make an effort to improve the thermal efficiency of their homes as they seek to make home improvements, or replace old boilers (what, in combination, it calls Building Regulations). However, Decc has calculated that the impact of its policies excluding Building Regulations would see the savings fall from £166 to £87 by 2020. Decc has also thought about the rebound effort - or \"comfort taking\", as it calls it - of such savings, which I believe is an important consideration. Here's what it says on page 72: The savings from Products Policy are net of a heat replacement effect (HRE). The HRE occurs where improved efficiency results in a reduction in the amount of useful space heating from products, resulting in an increase in the use of heating systems. Comfort taking (the direct rebound effect whereby the reduced cost of running appliances means they will be run more often) has not been modelled, with the exception of boilers. For many products the a priori expectation is the magnitude of the comfort taking impact is likely to be small. For instance, for fridges comfort taking would not be likely to occur, and for TV use the magnitude may be expected to be small. Finally, a risk of overlapping benefits between specific product areas may always remain – the modelling strips out such impacts where possible. It is also worth noting that the modelling is being reviewed, and that future impacts will be updated to reflect this, including the treatment of uncertainty in the longer term. In order to realise savings associated with Products Policy, upfront financial costs are incurred to purchase the more efficient products. The increased costs of products are included in the relevant Impact Assessments. On the issue of savings gained through the roll-out of smart meters, I detect a worrying lack of detail. All the analysis document keeps saying is \"smart meters are expected to encourage more energy efficient behaviour\", but, from what I can see, Decc never expands to explain that assumption. Perhaps I have missed it? Can anyone else see where it \"shows its workings\" on smart meters? Annex F is also key as it breaks down in detail the cost/saving for each individual policy on domestic energy bills now, in 2020 and in 2030. I have taken a screenshot of the table, but if the quality is not high enough for you look at the original on page 83 of this pdf... For those wishing to drill deep into Decc's assumptions and methodologies, you will need the 98-page pdf document entitled, Estimated impacts of energy and climate change policies on energy prices and bills. Personally, I think Annex C \"Scope of the Analysis\" on page 75 is a good place to start to get a quick sense of some of Decc's caveats and smallprint. Other key parts of the document are section 6, \"Sensitivity analysis\", on page 56 and, obviously, Annex A, \"An introduction to Decc's modelling methodology and assumptions\", on page 58. But please let me know in the comments below if you spot your own key section. Here's an early round-up of some of the reaction... Andrew Pendleton, Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns : Building a 21st century energy system is overdue. The longer we hesitate the more it will eventually cost – and the greater the risk to our lives and livelihoods of devastating climate change. This report confirms that gas price hikes have been the driving force behind our soaring fuel bills and that spending more on clean power and energy saving is a wise investment for our economy – provided it’s done with clarity and vision. Harvesting the UK’s huge clean power potential and a comprehensive energy efficiency programme, financed by carbon taxes, is our best bet for tackling climate change and stabilising future fuel bills. Failure to do so will be costly for us all. Ministers must boost investor confidence in a low-carbon economy – starting with a 2030 decarbonisation target in the energy bill. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com: This report is a snapshot based on what Decc knows today – and this will keep changing and updating over the coming years. However, the underlying message is clear - there will be winners and losers as a result of the government’s energy policies. The winners will be those who take action to make their homes as energy efficient as possible to cushion themselves from the impact of policies on their bills. As far as consumers are concerned, the writing really is on the wall. While Decc is saying that households will benefit from its policies overall, the fact is that this will only be the case if they adapt their behaviour. This means taking advantage of schemes such as Green Deal, which can help them to ‘future-proof’ their homes. This is why it’s also important that Ofgem moves ahead swiftly with its market reforms and ensures that they are hitting the mark, as consumers will need the protection of a strong, competitive market to help keep energy prices under control. The fact is that we are all facing an uncertain future and energy affordability will continue to be a huge consumer concern – the priority has to be to help households to grasp the facts, understand the solutions and to adjust their behaviour as quickly as possible. Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council: Decc’s report shows that the only way is up for energy bills, and that most of the predicted price increases come from volatile wholesale gas prices. It’s vital that UK households are protected from rising bills, especially given that one in five homes are now in fuel poverty. A cost effective and easy way to achieve this is by insulating our leaky homes. The frustration is that while the government has only recently launched the Green Deal to do just that, it appears to be languishing at the sidelines of government priorities, as shown by chancellor George Osborne’s failure to even mention it in the recent budget. We need government to show that it is committed to helping people reduce their spiralling energy bills by promoting insulation and refurbishment, and offering some real support to get the Green Deal off the ground. Steve Radley, policy director at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation: This is a wake-up call. Policies are already adding 30% to business electricity prices, and this will rise to 50% by 2020 and 70% by 2030. Measures to shield the most energy intensive industries from a portion of the costs will make a difference but, unless we get a grip on spiralling policy costs, steeply rising electricity prices for the rest of the sector risk making the UK an increasingly unattractive location for industrial investment and undermining efforts to rebalance the economy. The first step is scrapping costly policies with questionable environmental impact, such as the carbon price floor and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme, as soon as public finances allow. Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association: The cost of energy may be rising but households and businesses can take positive steps to limit bill increases with efficiency measures and investment in on-site renewables. Predicting future fossil fuel costs in a volatile international market is fraught with uncertainties. Investment in energy infrastructure is essential, as is the switch to renewable energy. Government intervention on both new generation and demand reduction should save households money overall. That's got to be good news for the UK's future security and prosperity. Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary: The government's underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families' energy bills is shameful. At a time when hard-pressed families and pensioners are seeing their incomes squeezed, only this out-of-touch government could expect people to fork out thousands of pounds on new TVs, fridge freezers and washing machines. Instead of cooking the books to trick people into thinking their energy bills will be lower, ministers should get behind Labour's plans to overhaul the energy market and deliver fair prices for the public. Here's the infographic that Decc has produced to explain at a glance how it believes its various policies will help to bring down the average domestic energy bill by £166 by 2020... Here's a quick summary of the press coverage this morning... Daily Mail: £286 green tax on energy bills: But ministers insist 'efficient appliances' will SAVE us money Christopher Booker in the Daily Mail: What planet are they living on? As freezing Britain faces a grave energy crisis, ministers unveil more green gimmicks and eco taxes. What folly Daily Telegraph: Households 'will have to buy green appliances' to benefit from Government energy bill boasts Business Green: Businesses call for action as new figures reveal impact of climate policies BBC: Energy policies 'reduce bill rises' Utility Week: Energy policy hits medium businesses hardest Financial Times: Fears on gas supplies played down BBC Radio 4's Today programme: Greg Barker interview at 8:31 Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, has announced this morning that the government's policies will help to lower domestic energy bills by, on average, £166 by 2020. The Guardian reports: Analysis by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) published on Wednesday showed that 85% of the present average £1,250 bill cannot be controlled by the government because it is determined by international gas and electricity prices, transmission and metering costs. After energy companies have taken their profits, and VAT has been paid, government policies can only influence around 11% of the bill, said Davey. In a riposte to some Conservative politicians and media which have claimed that wind power will cost more than £120bn in the next eight years and send household bills soaring, he claimed that energy-saving policies, better gas boilers, tighter building regulations, the coalition's green deal loan scheme and smart meters could save householders around £166 a year by 2020. According to Decc, that is an 11% cut compared to the government doing nothing. Rising energy bills are a hot political topic in the UK at present so the department's analysis is likely to be keenly challenged and interrogated, particularly its assumptions and methodologies. For example, can energy prices really be estimated accurately out to 2020, or even - as the analysis attempts to do - to 2030? How can both the savings and costs of various policies be predicted when so many variables are at play? Please leave your own thoughts below. If you are quoting figures, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/27/japan-royal-couple-visit-tsunami-hit-town","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-27T09:52:02Z","webTitle":"Japan royal couple visit tsunami-hit town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/japan-royal-couple-visit-tsunami-hit-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/27/japan-royal-couple-visit-tsunami-hit-town","fields":{"headline":"Japan royal couple visit tsunami-hit town","bodyText":"Japan's emperor has made his first visit to the area that bore the full force of last month's earthquake and tsunami, as the government admitted it was struggling to secure enough land for temporary homes for tens of thousands of evacuees. Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko, spoke to survivors at an evacuation shelter in Minamisanriku – a Miyagi prefecture town of 20,000 where 496 people died and another 656 are missing, presumed dead. The tsunami destroyed 3,800 houses in the town, leaving more than 6,000 people homeless. The royal couple were greeted by rescue workers and briefed on the recovery effort. The pair spent about 30 minutes speaking to some of the 200 evacuees living in a school gymnasium. They later visited another shelter in Sendai before flying back to Tokyo on a military helicopter, according to the imperial household agency. Shin Kageyama, a volunteer in Minamisanriku, 250 miles north-east of the capital, accused the government of neglecting the immediate needs of evacuees while it focuses on the nuclear crisis. The emperor, he said, had lifted their spirits, but added: \"If the prime minister came, we'd all just feel like punching him.\" He told Associated Press: \"Maybe it's taboo to say this, but the emperor is truly like a god.\" The imperial couple's previous visits have been confined to evacuation centres nearer Tokyo. On Monday they will visit Iwate prefecture, north of Miyagi, and Fukushima early next month to meet residents driven out of their homes by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the agency said. The government estimates it will need to build about 72,000 prefabricated homes for the 130,000 evacuees still living in shelters in the three worst-affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. It has promised to build 30,000 units by the end of May, and the remainder by the end of the summer. As of last week only 395 units had been completed. This week, however, the government said it was confident it could secure enough land for only 52,000 prefabs. Officials say the rehousing effort is being held up by the high cost of materials, labour shortages and the dearth of flat land on higher ground. In addition, some evacuees have said they do not want to be re-housed away from their own towns and villages. The government is considering borrowing private land as all available publicly owned spaces have been earmarked for prefab construction. Evacuees will be entitled to live in the units, rent-free, for up to two years, but will have to pay for electricity and other utilities. In Ishinomaki, 6,700 households drew lots for a place in temporary units able to accommodate just 137 of them. \"It's like winning a prize in a lottery,\" said one evacuee who has been living in a junior high school for almost seven weeks. \"But it's also too late,\" he told Kyodo News."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/08/fukushima-nuclear-plant-melt-through","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-08T06:39:35Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear plant may have suffered 'melt-through', Japan admits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/08/fukushima-nuclear-plant-melt-through","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/08/fukushima-nuclear-plant-melt-through","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear plant may have suffered 'melt-through', Japan admits","bodyText":"Molten nuclear fuel in three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant is likely to have burned through pressure vessels, not just the cores, Japan has said in a report in which it also acknowledges it was unprepared for an accident of the severity of Fukushima. It is the first time Japanese authorities have admitted the possibility that the fuel suffered \"melt-through\" – a more serious scenario than a core meltdown. The report, which is to be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said fuel rods in reactors No 1, 2 and 3 had probably not only melted, but also breached their inner containment vessels and accumulated in the outer steel containment vessels. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), says it believes the molten fuel is being cooled by water that has built up in the bottom of the three reactor buildings. The report includes an apology to the international community for the nuclear crisis – the world's worst since Chernobyl in 1986 – and expresses \"remorse that this accident has raised concerns around the world about the safety of nuclear power generation\". The prime minister, Naoto Kan, said: \"Above all, it is most important to inform the international community with thorough transparency in order for us to regain its confidence in Japan.\" The report comes a day after Japan's nuclear safety agency said the amount of radiation that leaked from Fukushima Daiichi in the first week of the accident may have been more than double that initially estimated by Tepco. The 750-page report, compiled by Japan's emergency nuclear task force, concedes that the country was wrongfooted by the severity of the accident, which occurred after the plant was struck by waves more than 14 metres high following the earthquake on 11 March. \"We are taking very seriously the fact that consistent preparation for severe accidents was insufficient,\" the report said. \"In light of the lessons learned from the accident, Japan has recognised that a fundamental revision of its nuclear safety preparedness and response is inevitable.\" The nuclear task force's head, Goshi Hosono, said Tepco had failed to adequately protect plant workers early on in the crisis, and had provided inadequate information about radiation leaks. About 7,800 workers had been involved in the battle to stabilise the plant as of late May, the report said. While their average exposure dose was well within safe limits, \"a certain number\" may have been exposed to more than 250 millisieverts per year, the maximum allowable dose under revised government guidelines for Fukushima workers. The report acknowledged that bureaucratic red tape, and the division of responsibilities across several government agencies, had hampered the response to the accident. It said the government would separate the country's nuclear safety watchdog from the trade and industry ministry, a recommendation made earlier this month by a team of experts from the IAEA. The trade and industry minister, Banri Kaieda, said Japan would share all available data and co-operate with the IAEA. \"Our country bears a serious responsibility to provide data to the international community with maximum transparency, and to actively contribute to nuclear safety,\" he said. The most urgent problem facing workers at Fukushima Daiichi is how to deal with vast quantities of highly radioactive water that has accumulated in reactor buildings and basements and in ditches. The estimated 100,000 tonnes of contaminated liquid – runoff from water used to douse overheating reactors – is hampering efforts to repair the plant's cooling systems. Tepco has said it hopes to have a system in place by the middle of the month to remove radioactive substances from the water, enabling it to be reused to cool reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/13/green-economy-speech-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-13T12:14:00Z","webTitle":"The green speech David Cameron should give | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/13/green-economy-speech-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/13/green-economy-speech-cameron","fields":{"headline":"The green speech David Cameron should give","bodyText":"With chancellor George Osborne badmouthing the green economy, those who see clean and sustainable investment as an opportunity not a threat are desperate for David Cameron to give strong public backing to his government's environmental policies. Ironically, the policies are pretty good – green deal, green investment bank, renewable heat incentive and so on – but without clear support from the top those investors who sign the big cheques needed to get the green economy going are going to waver. Since pledging to lead the \"greenest government ever\" days after taking office, the prime minister has been all but silent. With our comment and leader writer Julian Glover now off to write Cameron's speeches, I thought I'd help him on his way by writing the speech Cameron should – and could – give. Let me be absolutely clear, I don't agree with it all and the political attacks are just me getting into character. It is not \"me\" slamming Labour's record. The speech aims to give wholehearted support to those wishing to create jobs and growth in green industries, while addressing the fears about rising energy bills and the costs of going green. I give you … the prime minister: I understand that times are tough right now. That's why the government I lead is working in every way possible to repair the economic damage Labour left us and to make Britain fit to compete in the 21st century, bringing jobs and prosperity back. But while the global economic crisis threatens us today, the environmental crisis of climate change has not gone away. Unchecked, the damage global warming will cause to our prosperity is far greater. Not just affecting one year, one decade or even one generation, but blighting the prospects of our grandchildren and their grandchildren. That is why we need to tackle both the economic and climate challenges. And the good news is that we can do both. By saving energy, we make our homes warmer, our businesses more competitive and our nation's energy supply more secure. The best protection from rising energy bills is properly insulating our homes to make them warmer and cheaper to heat. That's why our Green deal programme will see 14m homes refurbished by 2020 - without causing home energy bills to rise by a penny. Along with our backing for modern, clean heating systems, these measures will create a thriving industry of local tradesmen serving local communities. How we generate our energy has to change too. We have no choice. One third of our coal and nuclear plants will close in the next decade and Labour's years of inaction meant nothing was in place to replace them. Thanks to the great work of Chris Huhne and his colleagues at Decc, we now have a strong plan. And the strength of that plan, like Britain itself, comes from diversity. Gas, nuclear, wind power and more; all will have their role to play. You may think wind turbines are a waste of time, stranded when the wind stops. Let me tell you, nuclear power plants go offline and the gas tap can be switched off as the Ukraine discovered to its cost. You may think renewable energy is too expensive to support in difficult economic times. That might be true if the cost of oil and gas was on a downward trend, or even holding steady. It is not. Building clean energy is an investment in keeping energy bills down in the long term. And let me be clear, green taxes are not the reason our energy bills are rising, it is the soaring cost of fossil fuels. We must get off that hook. But do not think for a moment that we are continuing Labour's wasteful ways. We will squeeze the greatest value for money out of every pound of invested. That is why we changed the feed in tariff given to large solar energy farms: Ed Miliband left a scandalous scheme where big business could get rich at taxpayers' expense. We will not tolerate a penny of waste as we build an energy system fit for the future. Many businesses will flourish as the UK leaves the polluting, high carbon economy behind: those making electric cars in the northeast, developing wave and tidal power in the south west, regenerating entire cities in the Midlands. I thank those businesses for what they have done and ask them to do even more, secure in the knowledge that I am on your side and by your side now and in the future. Other businesses are concerned that in our determination the create a secure energy system and fight global warming, we are making it harder for them to compete. Those of you making steel, cement, ceramics and paper, you say tougher rules on emissions will drive jobs to countries with weaker rules. That would be a double catastrophe: losing jobs and a losing battle against climate change. I will not let that happen. We value your work and we need your products to build a new Britain. But this is no time for handouts or special treatment. The country cannot afford it. Where there is genuine danger to your business, we will act. Where you overreach and seek to profit without effort from Britain's public purse, we will close the door. I want to talk now about leadership. I have been leading the Conservative party for six years now. As prime minister, I have taken action when others have said it was better not to: protecting Britain's economic security with a resolute deficit reduction plan; helping the Libyan people rid themselves of a cruel dictator; ensuring our international aid continues to help the very poorest in the world. Actions speak far louder than words. So when we discuss with the US or China or India or Japan how to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving global warming, we must do so from a position of leadership. We cannot demand action from others if we do not act ourselves. And if all nations waited for others to act, failure would inevitably follow, with terrible consequences. Britain can be a leader in the world. In the quality of our homes, in clean technology and industry, in the battle to defeat climate change. And we can reap the just rewards of leadership, jobs, growth and a modern, sustainable economy. Things may be difficult now, but there is a brighter future ahead. Work with me to secure that brighter future, for your family, your country and your world. Thank you. There.

We have a big ally in reality. The planet is under assault. This collision with human civilisation, as its currently being operated, is increasingly dire. An economist called Herman Daly said years ago that we're operating Planet Earth as if it's a business in liquidation. More and more people are recognising that. And one of the political tipping points came in the US election last November and the decision by President Obama to keep his campaign pledges and to move boldly and swiftly towards a cap-and-trade system, and incentives for renewable energy, a national smart grid, and all the other things he is proposing. I think that movement, once begun, will shift the world system towards a new equilibrium. In the US, there have been 80 cancellations of major new coal-burning plants and people thought that maybe we'll be able to block a few of them, but they have now virtually stopped building them in the US. [Business leaders] are seeing the writing on every wall they look at. They're seeing the complete disappearance of the polar ice caps right before their eyes in just a few years. They're seeing the statements of Chinese leaders as they're instructing their provinces to come up with quotas for a cap-and-trade option internally. They're seeing the new US administration. They're seeing Gordon Brown and David Cameron both advocate dramatic changes here [in the UK]. In the US, they're seeing the Environmental Protection Agency going to regulate CO2 as a pollutant. Just yesterday they put out a request for a carbon registry where large firms have to publicly account for their CO2 emissions. And they're looking at Washington DC where, two weeks ago, there were 12,000 young people in town [marching] on this issue and 2,000 of them formed a barricade around the coal plant… If you look on a global basis, the largest grassroots movement in the history of the world is emerging. There are many hundreds of thousands of new organisations that have sprung up all over the world and, 20,000 here and 20,000 there, when you add it up globally, it's a big movement. Gore responding to James Lovelock's comment that the European carbon market a \"scam\" James Lovelock has forgotten more about science than I will ever learn. But in analysing political systems he is perhaps allowing his understandable frustration with the way politicians have dealt with this crisis to obscure some of the opportunities for change in the political system. There are tipping points in nature, but there are also tipping points in politics. The European trading system got off to a bad start because of the initial decisions made, but they have addressed those flaws and made it work much better. The fundamental problems are that it's like a bucket with a large hole in it because the US and China are not involved. Once there is a truly global carbon trading system the synergy will drive towards much higher levels of efficiency. Gore on whether climate change sceptics should be ignored or challenged The denial of global warming is persistent. After all, the denial of evolution is still common, probably more in my country than here [in the UK]. It's fed by garden-variety denial: it's unpleasant, people don't want to think about it. It's fed by a huge amount of funding from carbon special interests who have been financing these phoney, pseudo-scientific reports and they have a self-interest in sowing doubt. Doubt is their product. It's also fed by an ideological opposition and, coming out of the 20th century, the battle against excess statism in various forms became a deeply held view - and I share that view if it's stated properly - but some take it such an extreme that anything which implies a new regulation, or a new role for government, is automatically attacked with great veracity. And all these streams have come together to keep the denialism going, but they're becoming less and less relevant. Gore on smart grids A smart grid does two things: it allows the transmission over long distances with very minimal loses of renewable electricity from solar, wind and, eventually, from geothermal. The second thing that a smart grid does is that it empowers homeowners to make great strides in reducing wasteful energy use while enhancing productivity. A smart grid has to communicate. Once that's put in place, the renewable energy option will just proliferate very, very rapidly, not only in the large generating plants, but also in roof tops and wind mills. China is spending even more than the US on a smart grid. They're actually leading the world. Scandinavia is also doing good things. Gore on nuclear power I'm not a reflexive opponent of nuclear. I used to be enthusiastic about it, but I'm now sceptical about it. There's a few reasons. Let's assume for the moment that we will solve the problem of long-term storage of radioactive waste. Let's assume also that we'll figure out how to standardise their design as [each plant] is currently unique and that enhances the risk of operator accidents. Let's assume we can solve the terrorism threat to nuclear reactors. That still leaves a couple of very difficult problems. First and foremost, economics. The nuclear industry cannot give any reliable cost estimate for how much it will take to build a nuclear plant. When a utility is confronted with the absence of any advances for how much the construction cost is going to be, then that's a problem. Because the economics of nuclear only work at scale. You've got to have a 1,000 megawatt plant for it to be efficient and competitive. In the current environment, if you run a large utility that sells electricity you've got a certain amount of money to allocate in your budget. If you're looking at the trends towards more conservation and the rapid introduction of renewables, it's hard for you to project what your demand is going to be with as much precision as when the world was more predictable. As a result, you are less inclined to take all of your money and place one big bet on something that matures 12-15 years from now at an uncertain cost. That what's called a \"lumpy investment\" and they want smaller increments that give them smaller flexibility. In the US, there hasn't been a new order for a new reactor in 36 years. Yes, there is [more appetite for nuclear power now]. And because of the carbon crisis there will be more nuclear plants built and some of those being retired will be replaced by others. I think it will play a somewhat larger role, but it will not be the main option chosen. Whatever countries such as the US and the UK do, it will have a demonstration effect for the rest of the world. As the world comes to grips with how to solve the climate crisis, we in the US and the UK have a leadership role. If we told the rest of the world that nuclear is the answer [they would follow]. For the eight years that I spent in the White House every nuclear weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a reactor programme. People have said for years that there are now completely different [nuclear] technologies. OK, but if you have a team of scientists that can build a reactor, and you're a dictator, you can make them work at night to build a nuclear weapon. That's what's happened in North Korea and Iran. And in Libya before they gave it up. So the idea of, say, Chad, Burma, and Sudan having lots of nuclear reactors is insane and it's not going to happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/mar/05/japan-nuclear-power-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-05T11:42:25Z","webTitle":"New fire at quake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/05/japan-nuclear-power-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/mar/05/japan-nuclear-power-fire","fields":{"headline":"New fire at quake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant","bodyText":"The immediate future of the world's biggest nuclear power station was in doubt today after its eighth fire since it was closed almost two years ago by an earthquake. The fire at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power station in Japan came as its operators await local authorities' approval to restart one of its seven reactors. A 39-year-old worker received slight burns in the fire, which was quickly put out and did not cause a radiation leak, according to Tokyo Electric Power. The plant, in Niigata prefecture north-west of Tokyo, was shut down indefinitely after a magnitude 6.8 earthquake caused a fire and radiation leaks in July 2007. Japan's nuclear safety watchdog ordered Tokyo Electric to improve safety after another fire last December, but earlier this year the government approved the restarting of the No 7 reactor – the newest and least damaged of the nuclear generators – after deeming it safe. \"It is very regrettable that another fire occurred, even after our order,\" the deputy trade minister, Harufumi Mochizuki, told reporters. \"However, our view that safety at the No 7 reactor is restored remains unchanged.\" Tokyo Electric needs the approval of the prefectural government and local residents before it can restart the reactor. About 600,000 residents have signed a petition opposing the restart. Government inspectors will visit the scene of the latest fire tomorrow. Local government leaders will meet next week to discuss the plant's future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/feb/08/india-jaitapur-nuclear-disaster-biodiversity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-08T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"The truth behind India's nuclear renaissance | Praful Bidwai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/08/india-jaitapur-nuclear-disaster-biodiversity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/08/india-jaitapur-nuclear-disaster-biodiversity","fields":{"headline":"The truth behind India's nuclear renaissance","bodyText":"The global \"nuclear renaissance\" touted a decade ago has not materialised. The US's nuclear industry remains starved of new reactor orders since 1973, and western Europe's first reactor after Chernobyl (1986) is in serious trouble in Finland – 42 months behind schedule, 90% over budget, and in bitter litigation. But India is forging ahead to create an artificial nuclear renaissance by quadrupling its nuclear capacity by 2020 and then tripling it by 2030 by pumping billions into reactor imports from France, Russia and America, and further subsidising the domestic Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL). The first victim of this will be an extraordinarily precious ecosystem in the Konkan region of the mountain range that runs along India's west coast. This is one of the world's biodiversity \"hotspots\" and home to 6,000 species of flowering plants, mammals, birds and amphibians, including 325 threatened ones. It is the source of two major rivers. Botanists say it's India's richest area for endemic plants. With its magical combination of virgin rainforests, mountains and sea, it puts Goa in the shade. NPCIL is planning to install six 1,650-MW reactors here, at Jaitapur in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district, based on the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) design of the French company Areva – the very same that's in trouble in Finland. The government has forcibly acquired 2,300 acres under a colonial law, ignoring protests. As construction begins, mountains will be flattened, trees uprooted, harbours razed, and a flourishing farming, horticultural and fisheries economy destroyed, jeopardising 40,000 people's survival. To rationalise this ecocide, the government declared the area \"barren\". This is a horrendous lie, says India's best-known ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who heads the environment ministry's expert panel on its ecology. As I discovered during a visit to Jaitapur, there's hardly a patch of land that's not green with paddy, legumes, cashew, pineapple and coconut. So rich are its fisheries that they pay workers three times the statutory minimum wage, a rarity in India. Jaitapur's villagers are literate. They know about Chernobyl, radiation, and the nuclear waste problem. They have seen films on injuries inflicted on villagers like them by Indian uranium mines and reactors – including cancers, congenital deformities and involuntary abortions. They don't want the Jaitapur plant. Of the 2,275 families whose land was forcibly acquired, 95% have refused to collect compensation, including one job per family. The offer provokes derision, as does Indo-French \"co-operation\". When Nicolas Sarkozy visited India to sell EPRs, Jaitapur saw the biggest demonstration against him. The EPR safety design hasn't been approved by nuclear regulators anywhere. Finnish, British and French regulators have raised 3,000 safety issues including control, emergency-cooling and safe shutdown systems. A French government-appointed expert has recommended modifications to overcome the EPR's problems. Modifications will raise its cost beyond €5.7bn. Its unit generation costs will be three times higher than those for wind or coal. India had a nightmarish experience with Enron, which built a white elephant power plant near Jaitapur, nearly bankrupting Maharashtra's electricity board. Jaitapur's people are more concerned about being treated as sub-humans by the state, which has unleashed savage repression, including hundreds of arrests, illegal detentions and orders prohibiting peaceful assemblies. Eminent citizens keen to express solidarity with protesters were banned, including a former supreme court judge, the Communist party's secretary and a former Navy chief. Gadgil too was prevented. A former high court judge was detained illegally for five days. Worse, a Maharashtra minister recently threatened that \"outsiders\" who visit Jaitapur wouldn't be \"allowed to come out\" (alive). This hasn't broken the people's resolve or resistance. They have launched their own forms of Gandhian non-cooperation and civil disobedience. Elected councillors from 10 villages have resigned. People boycotted a 18 January public hearing in Mumbai convened to clear \"misconceptions\" about nuclear power. They refused to hoist the national flag, as is traditionally done, on Republic Day (26 January). They have decided not to sell food to officials. When teachers were ordered to teach pupils about the safety of nuclear reactors, parents withdrew children from school for a week. The peaceful campaign, with all its moral courage, hasn't moved the government. It accepted an extraordinarily sloppy environmental assessment report on Jaitapur, which doesn't consider biodiversity and nuclear safety, or even mention radioactive waste. It subverted the law on environment-related public hearings. It cleared the project six days before Sarkozy's visit. Why the haste? India's nuclear establishment has persistently missed targets and delivered a fraction of the promised electricity – under 3% – with dubious safety. It was in dire straits till it conducted nuclear explosions in 1998, which raised its status within India's national-chauvinist elite – and its budget. The major powers have \"normalised\" India's nuclear weapons through special exceptions in global nuclear commerce rules. France used these to drive a bargain for cash-strapped Areva. Its counterpart is the disaster-in-waiting called Jaitapur."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/31/yes-av-green-party-baden-wurttemberg","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-31T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"A yes to AV could make the Green party a force to reckon with | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/31/yes-av-green-party-baden-wurttemberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/31/yes-av-green-party-baden-wurttemberg","fields":{"headline":"A yes to AV could make the Green party a force to reckon with","bodyText":"When Ed Miliband did his bit for the alternative vote yes campaign this week, most of the attention focused on his newfound willingness to share a platform with Liberal Democrats. And rightly so. Yet it was the third party leader on Tuesday's platform, the one sitting behind Miliband in the video clips, Caroline Lucas of the Greens, who got me thinking too. Because if events fall Lucas's way, and if her party has the nerve and resources to exploit them, this could be the breakthrough decade for the Green party. This is certainly a week for taking Green politics more seriously than most do much of the time. The reason is the astonishing result of Sunday's two state-level elections in Germany. In the first of these, in the state of Rheinland-Pfalz, the Greens were the only party to significantly increase their share of the vote – up by 11%, thus giving them a share of power with the Social Democrats (SPD). But it was the other result that really took the breath away. In Baden-Württemberg, centred on Stuttgart, the Greens were the only party to boost their share, by 13% this time, vaulting past the SPD into second place. The upshot is that the Greens now lead a state-level coalition government (with the SPD as junior partners) for the first time in German history. And not just in any German state, either. Baden-Württemberg is an economic powerhouse. It's probably where your washing machine or your cooker was made, quite likely your computer too, and perhaps even, if you are lucky and rich or both, your car. That's right. It's a place with 5% annual economic growth, where in a technical sense there is full employment, and where they make Mercedes-Benz cars. And now it has elected a Green-led government. It's worth reflecting on this for a moment. Most of the people who switched to the Greens last Sunday had previously voted for Angela Merkel's CDU, the equivalent of our Conservatives. And even though the local state government – a conservative-liberal coalition like Merkel's and like Britain's – was unpopular, it wasn't the largest opposition party, the SPD (the equivalent of the Labour party), which benefited. It was the previously unsuccessful Greens. If nothing else, these elections have been a thumbs-down verdict on the SPD. So often the electoral pacesetter on the European left, the SPD now struggles to hold on to more than one German vote in four. And it is the Greens who are now in many ways its greatest electoral rival – as well as its most probable governmental partner. Hang on, though. Can't all this be put down to an unrepeatable set of circumstances, with the Greens surging because of the combined political impact of the post-tsunami radiation leaks at the Fukushima plant in Japan and Merkel's panic U-turn on the nuclear power issue in Germany? Possibly so. Yet big events can have long consequences as well as instant impacts. It would be a big surprise if the Greens did not significantly boost their already strong positions in state-level elections in Bremen and Berlin later this year, thus continuing the momentum. And if the Merkel coalition were to implode, which it probably won't but may do, it would be brave to bet against the Greens, currently on 21% nationally behind the SPD's 25% and the CDU's 33%, coming second. But what has all this to do with Britain? Surely our politics march to our own, different drum? Is it not the height of fantasy to imagine Lucas, the sole MP from a party that secured a mere 1% of the national vote in 2010, leading the kind of impact which the German Greens, with at least a couple of dozen MPs in the Bundestag for most of the last 30 years, have achieved in a country with a much greater environmentalist and anti-nuclear tradition, and a fair electoral system to boot? All true and all serious points. Yet don't overlook the similarities. The big parties are in decline in Britain too, just as they are in Germany. Electoral pluralism is growing as the big parties lose share. The main big party of the left, in particular, struggles to attract new parts of the electorate. The liberal party, although traditionally green, is in electoral eclipse, perhaps for a long time. And after the 5 May referendum we may also have a fairer voting system, in which second preferences will count, allowing smaller parties that have a wide second-preference appeal a chance of winning more seats – which is why the Greens and Ukip, unlike the much more narrowly based BNP, stand to benefit. Yes, the British Greens are weaker and smaller than the German Greens. But the political weather in northern Europe has many similarities and it is not entirely fanciful, I think, to see the British Greens potentially beginning to follow where the German party has led. There's a small sign of that in this week's Scotsman-YouGov opinion poll, which puts the Greens a sliver ahead of the Lib Dems in fourth place in the race for the Scottish parliament on 5 May. Not a breakthrough. Not conclusive. But a glimmer of a possibility all the same. A space may be opening up in our politics. More than anything, the British Greens need to attach themselves to a set of issues which they and the electorate both care about enough to be an effective protest party. Is nuclear power that issue, as it was at the German state elections? It certainly cannot be ignored as a focus. But the HS2 rail project through the Chilterns and the Vale of Aylesbury could be a better campaigning bet in parts of southern England and the Midlands. The Greens may be a radical party, but they have to look for conservative appeal. Many other major uncertainties would, of course, all need to fall the Greens' way if the party is to push forward across a wide enough electoral front to create anything approaching real national momentum. Good results in Scotland – six MSPs at Holyrood instead of the current two – and Wales, where the Greens have no AMs, would be a start. The right Westminster byelection – though in 2010 only two Green candidates won more than 10% – could be an opportunity. The Greens also desperately need one or two more charismatic leaders, in addition to the popular Lucas, with the same conservative \"realo\" appeal on major business-friendly issues that Winfried Kretschmann managed to harness in Baden-Württemberg this week. Right now, though, it is AV that holds the key, especially at a time when Labour is uncertain, the Lib Dems eclipsed and the Tories unpopular. Vote for AV and the Greens could eventually be Britain's fourth party. Vote against it and they will remain firmly rooted in the margins of the margins. One way or the other, we'll know after 5 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2011/mar/31/nick-clegg-blossoms-amid-jacarandas","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-31T19:29:46Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg blossoms amid the jacarandas in Mexico City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/31/nick-clegg-blossoms-amid-jacarandas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/mar/31/nick-clegg-blossoms-amid-jacarandas","fields":{"headline":"Nick Clegg blossoms amid the jacarandas in Mexico City","bodyText":"As political briefings go it was already unusual – a patio table lit by tea lights in a warm courtyard full of fuchsia-coloured bougainvillea. At dusk in Mexico City on Tuesday, Nick Clegg's policy adviser Richard Reeves and the Conservative universities minister, David Willetts, drinking local beer, talked journalists (drinking tea) through the coalition's social mobility strategy before its launch next week. After Reeves did a particularly spectacular policy-wonk pirouette, Willetts slapped him on the back with glee and exclaimed how enjoyable it was to be involved in such a 24-carat nerdathon. \"I hope you realised what that was,\" a Clegg aide, said later. \"That was the first joint coalition policy briefing. That has never happened before.\" Though the level-headed aide doesn't do hyperbole, here was a suggestion of a new level in the mind-meld between Tories and Lib Dems. But in Britain, this week seems to have been marked by coalition discord. David Cameron is said to be peeved that the Lib Dems are turning on Andrew Lansley's health reforms. The public fight between Sayeeda Warsi and Chris Huhne over the AV campaign is almost ready for the coalition divorce courts. Tory aides now say they have to read the FT or this paper to find out what their coalition partners think, whereas a few months previously it would have been the proverbial pillow talk. More substantially, Tories charge that it is Lib Dem dilution of their reforms that is scuttling them. MPs of one stripe call journalists to find out what the other lot are saying about them. It seems to be the first bout of bare-knuckle scrapping in the undergrowth. Into this mix put Clegg tripping off to Latin America, where he made comments to my colleagues and me which suggested he was launching anti-nuclear-energy, pro-Islamist and social engineering salvos. He appeared to have found his inner Simón Bolívar among the vivid violet jacaranda trees. His excursion caused deep alarm. Except from where I was standing, he seemed to be on a pretty successful intellectual and trade exchange. This is how the stories happened: in downtime moments away from the main events, we questioned him on the issues of the day and he answered as best he could – he pointed to very real speculation about nuclear power once post-Fukushima insecurity is factored in. He didn't seek to take on Cameron or rewrite coalition energy policy. On Islamism, he included the not very far-fetched suggestion that an Islamist government might come next in Libya. This was an expansion of a point he made in a heavyweight speech on a new era of multilateral liberal interventionism, updating Blair's principles with a kind of anti-Chicago Chicago speech. And – to the extent it differs from official government policy – it's a licensed philosophical disagreement within a coalition government. This trip was not a re-creation of the Lib Dem battle-bus. Clegg expended serious effort to ensure there was a Tory on board. Michael Gove was a contender until Gove's private office said his fear of flying made that a non-starter. Willetts told me that in many of the private meetings he and Clegg held with businessmen seeking to trade with Britain, Clegg spoke – often in Spanish – about David Cameron's plans for the region and in the UK. In Mexico, there is a possibility that the next election may result in a coalition, so Mexicans wanted to know whether and how coalitions worked. In Washington later in the trip, the philosophical differences in the coalition came out to play. Joe Biden's chief economist, Jared Bernstein, and members of the White House taskforce on the middle class laid on a spread to discuss with the Brits what Reeves introduced to them as \"alarm clock Britain\". One American at the seminar said: \"Whaaaat?\" \"It works for some people,\" Reeves said. Reeves set out what he'd set out the night before – the new indicators to monitor social mobility, and immobility. Willetts made a cri de coeur for Conservativism. \"Speaking as a representative of the Tory party, I still believe the approach to the Labour market of Thatcher and then Blair – a liberal labour market that doesn't try to achieve social objectives – that model has performed for us quite well during that recession. That model is one I still back.\" When a senior civil servant from the Treasury expressed despondency over the idea that social mobility can be improved, saying that the middle classes will conspire to prevent less advantaged kids from coming through, Willetts said: \"Wanting to do the best for their kids – for many people, it adds meaning to their lives. [And] I believe these people want to do well for all kids – the next generation as a whole.\" The trip also suggested Clegg is changing. Bernstein and co were quite rapt as Clegg warned that the \"disconnect between the dynamism of our economies and the squeezed middle has an effect on the political legitimacy of government\". If prosperity is generated in a country, but \"people's kids don't have a part of it, then what are we there for?\" Clegg married specifics with a sense of impatience with himself and a slight self-loathing when talking about his own pushy-parent aspirations for his children. He was without that grating piety he adopts far too much in speechifying, and instead was just talking. It was much more convincing. As for where the well-paying jobs will come from, it was Clegg who took the Americans up, pointing out that the labour market has to be monitored more closely so that more jobs are created for people to get, and not just focusing, as he normally does, on policies that will improve the likelihood of people being in a position to get jobs. He seemed to be asking harder questions than before. While people in the UK were seeing a great big coalition division, in America Willetts and Clegg showed that the mix of practical convergence and honest disagreement continued. After the transgressions on nuclear power, social engineering and Islamism, one newspaper asked this week: \"What is the point of Nick Clegg?\" The worry might be that the point of Nick Clegg is that the coalition relationships reside almost totally in him and fall apart the moment he leaves. For an internationalist, never leaving the country this side of the election is a daunting prospect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/03/uk-urges-talks-with-taliban-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-03T14:33:27Z","webTitle":"With Bin Laden gone, US must talk to Taliban and Pakistan, says Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/03/uk-urges-talks-with-taliban-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/03/uk-urges-talks-with-taliban-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"With Bin Laden gone, US must talk to Taliban and Pakistan, says Britain","bodyText":"The British government hopes Osama bin Laden's death will encourage the US to press harder for political talks on the future of Afghanistan with the Taliban and Pakistan. Britain's defence chiefs in particular are impatient with American reluctance to push ahead with the political agenda before the outcome of more military operations are known. British commanders suggest that whatever military operations are undertaken by US-led foreign forces in Afghanistan, this coming \"fighting season\" will be especially bloody, with insurgents attacking soft, mainly Afghan, targets and using suicide bombers. Whitehall's growing realisation that Pakistan will play a key role in talks about Afghanistan's future, as well as countering terrorism, is reflected in comments by an array of ministers in the wake of Bin Laden's death. Whatever their private views, the message was clear: the west needs Pakistan more than Pakistan needs the west. Last year David Cameron provoked a diplomatic row with Pakistan by accusing it of looking \"both ways\" on terrorism. Earlier this year, he headed a high-level delegation, including General Sir David Richards, chief of the defence staff, and Sir John Sawers, chief of the secret intelligence service, MI6. On Monday Cameron spoke on the phone to Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, and prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani. \"As far as they were concerned, Bin Laden was a foreigner who had no business being in Pakistan, who brought nothing but misery to their country. That is their strong view,\" he said. When pressed, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"If we turn away from them and give up on them and say 'This is all too difficult and complicated because we don't always get what we want', you are left with a nuclear power in danger of massive extremism and massive instability.\" Cameron said the death of Bin Laden was \"clearly a helpful development\" in terms of the military campaign in Afghanistan but need not hasten the UK's exit. \"I don't think it will necessarily change any timetables but we should use it as an opportunity to say to the Taliban: 'Now is the time to separate yourself from al-Qaida, to give up your weapons, to accept the basic tenets of the Afghan constitution,' \"said Cameron. The Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, was asked on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday if he agreed with suggestions from US officials that Pakistan must have known something about Bin Laden's whereabouts. He replied: \"We do not know about that. What we do know is that Pakistan is a vital partner in counter-terrorism issues for the UK and for the rest of the world community. They have lost a lot of their own security forces to terrorism, they are fighting it very hard in their own country, and of course they are playing a key role in Afghanistan.\" He added: \"We don't know all the circumstances behind the location of Bin Laden and the events yesterday but we do know that Pakistan will remain a very important security partner for us and for the international community.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2012/aug/31/your-views-on-the-news-31-august","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-31T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Your views on the news – Heathrow, Green leadership and London Met","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2012/aug/31/your-views-on-the-news-31-august","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2012/aug/31/your-views-on-the-news-31-august","fields":{"headline":"Your views on the news – Heathrow, Green leadership and London Met","bodyText":"Third runway at Heathrow The transport secretary, Justine Greening, has ruled out a third runway at Heathrow, saying it is \"not a long-term solution\" to improving the UK's aviation capacity. newenergyspace writes: It will be built, one way or another. The only other option is to close Heathrow and Gatwick and build a brand new airport in the Estuary, which would be a typical London-centric approach as it would block the rest of the country off and turn the M25 into anarchy. Another solution is this: Build a new, large airport in the north or midlands, and get people from those areas to use those. If Heathrow is supposed to be just a 'hub' where people can change, use it for that and remove all none-connecting flights to free up slots. falco1978 says: Expansion of Heathrow would be very damaging to a large part of London's quality of life. The requirement of planes to Heathrow to land into a pre-dominant westerley wind and Heathrows location to the west of London means that a high number of planes have to low-fly over London to land. This isn't just about South West London but both North East and South East. I can imagine non-Londoners don't care but it's idiotic to have this noise-disruption over the most densely populated area of the country. Whilst it may be the most expensive option the long-term best solution is for the Thames Estuary location where most noise occurs over the sea. Having this linked to London via high speed trains and Europe with the chunnel would make it accessible and as green as would be possible. Why everyone has suddenly decided we're being constrained by airport capacity is beyond me... who exactly is it effecting? if it means there is a constraint on needless ecologically-damaging flying then so be it! poddys comments: Geographically speaking, a new airport east or northeast of London would just make it harder still for people west of London to get there. Living in Southampton I already discount Stanstead when looking for flights because of the long journey times to get there. Logically, I would have thought that a new large airport somewhere around Newbury would (a) take the traffic pressure off London and (b) make the airport far more accessible for people from the South, Southwest, The Midlands and South Wales. You have the M4 running east/west from there and the A34 running north/south. Building a humongous airport from scratch there, with a view to it replacing Heathrow in the future makes sense to me. Of course nobody is going to want one of the largest airports in the world on their doorstep, but starting from scratch this ought to give airport designers an opportunity to allow for the best design for terminals, parking, and access to and from the airport. richardofbirmingham adds: A wider strategic approach than a londoncentric one is needed. Trade with the developing world requires a reinvigoration of the manufacturing heartlands of the north and midlands. London will continue to be the prime tourist destination of choice and financial services is likely to remain a major earner but a rebalancing is crucial if we are to continue to prosper. This implies a shift in infrastructure investment away from the south east and London, in particular. Expansion of Birmingham International Airport combined with the direct rail link into the high speed continental system which will connect the midlands and, later, the north, is a better choice. A rail stop off facility in London will meet any capacity issue especially, as many will no longer need to travel to Heathrow from other areas. Ghana's returnees Fellow returnees provided fascinating insights in response to Afua Hirsch's piece on her own experience and the trend among Ghanaians to return to Ghana to work and live. huggahoddie posts: Afua you have written my own story. I didn't return to Ghana until my 32nd birthday last year and it humbled me to think that I was ever ashamed of my heritage. I learned about Nkrumah, Du Bois and many other pan africanists who fought to valiantly for my freedom. To think that I ever wanted to be disassociated with them because I bought into the lies the media here told me makes me sick. I can't wait to go back and do what I can to build the country and get back to my roots. Thank you so much for this article and thank you Guardian for letting alternative voices be heard nansikom says: Thanks, Afua, for this excellent and informative article. As a white Brit married to a Ugandan lady with South Africa as home, my family and I have navigated similar issues to you but in a country that is still recovering from the institutionalised racism and oppression of apartheid. I recognise, however, your nuanced portrait of the complexities of African countries. I usually work in three or four other southern African countries for short periods of up to three weeks at a time every year and, while there are obviously similarities, there are also great differences. Zimbabwe is as different from South Africa as the UK is from France! I think that the most important issue for Africa is however one that you didn't mention and that is the rural development. Africa is the continent that has the most under-utilised land and natural resources and the rest of the world is already getting hold of these reseources very rapidly! The greatest differences throughout Africa are between vibrant and rapidly growing cities and rural areas, still often deeply isolated, where subsistence agriculture often dominates and where poverty is at its worst. Transition from communal to freehold land tenure systems is not the panacea for development that many, including the World Bank, seem to think it is. It is however vital that mixed land tenure systems are developed that both encourage inward investment for commercial agriculture while safeguarding land rights and access for the poor. The great issue of the next half century as African rural areas open up to the outside world, will be to ensure that rural development is equitable and benefits the poor. Shamboz writes: Good article but my experience is slightly different. The degree to which you can truley appreciate Ghana depends like any where else on your family background and their access to money. Most Ghanaians live from hand to mouth and superstition is the mainstay of society. Attitudes to difference eg homosexuality are still archaic and many of the wealthy blame the 'lazy' poor for their own misfortune. I vist regularly and have been disappointed at some of these issues. One of the problems that was being broadcast by the media was the disgraceful treatment of albinos similar to other parts of Africa. Ghanaians are suspicious of people like me as they see us as a threat to the status quo. Expressing views contrary to the norm has left me feeling quite isolated. It is a great country but many attitudes can be unkind and difficult to stomach. abowbe comments: I am also mixed British Ghanaian. I took little interest in my Ghanaian culture or heritage until my late teens. I was the black girl with a funny name in a predominantly white area (compared to being the obruni with the Ghanaian name in Ghana).I took my first trip to Ghana 3 years ago. Despite feeling permanently frustrated and overheated, and finding it difficult to comprehend some of the conservative and narrow-minded attitudes, I immediately knew it was going to be a major part of my life. Although I am not sure that I will be relocating, i'll continue to make frequent trips for personal and professional purposes. My partner's story is different. Having moved to the UK as a child, he made ad hoc trips to Ghana growing up. When the recession hit and he lost his job here, he began forging links and establishing business in Ghana. He now 'commutes'. I think it's great that we as second (and first) generation Ghanaians have found value and potential in our ancestral land, but we can't loose sight of the realities of life for the majority of Ghanaian people- including our family and friends. Hopefully the influx of returnees will result in greater quality of life and opportunities for local Ghanaians. Kwaku says: Afua, Congratulations on the bold move. It's always good you have a good-paying job to live decently in Ghana. I hate to say that after trying for decades to return and even investing hundreds of thousands of our live savings in Ghana, some of us have given up. Dealing with our entrenched greedy government officials who all emerged after the PNDC era, offends our ethical principles. I am sure you know Ghana has an existing law against allowing dual citizens to participate in elected political office. Ghana and African will never reach full potential as predicted compared to our Asian colleagues who studied and lived in the West due to the specific greed, envy, and direct sabotage of the few greedy men who took over Ghana in Dec.31, 1981 in a coup, which was treason. Afua, as a Diaspora returning with no interest in politics, you are Okay with them. You are no threat! Yours is one of the most honest articles I have read on Ghana and Africa. Most articles fail to mention the high unemployment rates. Great job! Wishing you all the best. Yes, there is hope but some have to get rid of the greedy leaders mindset. agbonowura65 says: Thanks for a balanced and fair assessment on the whole. However, I wish you had devoted a little more space discussing the bribery and corruption in Ghana. I think that is what undermines our efforts at development. a development that will ensure social, societal, and economic justice. Corruption starts with the lowly placed public servant; the beat cop on our streets and highways and the clerk tasked with processing your documents to register a company to the top gun at the ministry who determines whether you are awarded a contract to do business with the government. I find it suffocating. Is corruption really endemic to our culture or we just lack the moral fortitude to deal with the syndrome? I was away for over 30 years and to me the major changes appear to be the increased level of corruption and the filth in Accra. London Met University and international students London Met University has lost its right to recruit and teach non-EU students after the government said the institution had failed in its monitoring of its international student body. Readers were divided over the government's decision to withdraw its licence and the fate of the students affected. ranelagh75 says: Whilst it's extremely important to get hold of those who abuse the system and who have no intention to study in this country, this step seems a bit drastic and very poorly timed. What about those students (at least 75%, it would appear) who now need to find other courses and cope with the stress of being uprooted? What about those who are in the middle of their degree programme? What about the fees they have already paid? This seems to me to be little more than 'talking tough' and using innocent students as nothing more than pawns to score a few cheap political points whilst severely impacting hundreds, if not thousands, of lives in the process. WitNit adds: A very disproportionate tool, but what do the UKBA care? Given the number of international students in the UK, you'd have thought that the UKBA would be sophisticated enough to time its investigation and any ensuing penalty in such a manner as not to victimise existing students, most of whom will be entirely innocent. Rightwingers may crow on about immigration, but the fact is that many UK colleges depend on internatonal students for funding, which also subsidises the cost of educating local students. This cack-handed process won't serve UK plc (or UK edu) very well. CanWeNotKnockIt writes: Suspect the government is using LMU as a warning shot across the bows of universities across the country as this issue affects pretty much all of them. But you do wonder whether a better move would have been placing LMU in some kind of special measures, enforcing managerial change along the lines of the approach to failing schools. OutOfOptions has this to say: I was involved in obtaining visas for students, academic visitors, and staff for people joining the clinical research department in which I worked and I don't think this is an out of proportion decision at all. Although, obviously, it must be awful for the individual (innocent) students involved and their UK based families (who may have jobs through their visa dependent status or be studying at a UK school). The checks and controls which are required (and the associated penalties for failure to meet them) are made very clear to all institutions before they are given permission to issue Certificates of Sponsorship or Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies numbers. The fact that all students (and staff) holding visas may be given just a couple of months to leave the country if serious failures are identified and permission to issue CoS/CASs removed is flagged up at every turn. We always understood this and took our responsibilities seriously. We individually lived in fear of being the one who messed up and lost us our CoS/CAS issuing licence. The Academics weren't so keen (they never enjoy admin) but when you reminded them that they could do bugger all research (and lose their grants) if half their post-docs and doctoral students disappeared overnight they suddently paid attention. It's boring and it takes time but that's just tough. There may be excuses for a small number of non-compliances, and the system allows for that. However, there can be no such excuses for the systematic failure to perform the most basic checks, as there seem to have been here. How can they not even be confirming English language capability? Where I worked you couldn't even be guaranteed a place on a course without a TOEFL (or equivalent) certificate showing the required minimum level. crazyjane says: The problem with the license revocation is that genuine students plus academic and support staff, from library and tech to cleaners, will end up paying for what seems to be administrative failures. A bit like the banks and the people in microcosm. I know governments like to send a message pour encourager les autres but surely something could be worked out that is less disastrous and the faults better identified. It also sends a very unwelcome message overseas. We might understand some of the ins and outs of the situation but I doubt many potential PG and Masters students will go into that much detail. HE is something that the UK does very well and this has long been appreciated throughout the world. While there is a good case for preventing abuse, this needs to be handled in a sensitive manner. Green party leadership The search for Caroline Lucas's replacement as leader of the Greens sparked a discussion on the future of the party in British politics. Jazzactivist writes: I have always been slightly put off by the Greens because of they seem very south-centric and not as opposed to capitalism and the wealth divide as I think they should be. However, the policies described in the article sound good to me. What we need is a genuine alternative to vote for that is brave enough to put people's needs before profits. That is committed to meeting people's human needs well and then works out how to apportion the beans to make it happen. A 'Can Do' political party, rather than one that claims that it can't or compromises its policies as the money supposedly isn't available to do it. It's about time our country was people-led rather than finance-led. As a long term Labour voter I'd vote Green now if a candidate stands for election here. Scamander shares some personal experience: As a resident of Brighton the Greens were initially a breath of fresh air when they took control of the council. I'm pretty sure they won't get re-elected though, trying to clothe their principles in reality hasn't really worked a great deal. Still good to have someone else at the till for a while. ireadnews says: I'm certainly thinking about voting for the Greens next election. One thing that does irk me however is their record on listening to Science in other departments other than climate change. For instance on GM crops and nuclear power. They're willing to listen to the scientific community when it comes to climate change but ignore it completely on these issues and act similarly to climate change deniers on these topics. Please gain some sense on these topics and I'd gladly pay for membership. Page4 says: I have a lot of time and respect for the greens but sadly this just about sums them up for me. It's laudable to want to increase female representation, but to switch to an only-one-man rule seems wrong-headed in the extreme. Either legislate for balance or just go with the best candidate, but don't end up in a halfway house that will be discriminatory. Surely the greens are open minded enough to not be swayed by gender bias and be able just to vote in the best candidates? The fact that there are more female than male candidates suggest they are starting from a good place.

The blighter was too clever by half – and too pleased with it ever to bother to conceal the fact. That and being a radical Lib Dem, comfortably well-off (by his own efforts), and nakedly ambitious. No wonder he was so keen on such dodgy projects as the euro, windmills and that AV referendum nonsense, they have been telling each other for ages. So the newspapers will be delighted with director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer's announcement that the Lib Dem cabinet minister has been charged over the allegation – apparently made in a moment of anger by his former wife, the economist Vicky Pryce – that he had asked someone to take his speeding points on his behalf when the then-MEP allegedly drove home too fast from Stansted airport in 2003. It was later alleged that the someone was Pryce herself. For once the tabloids did not make the running in the alleged scandal: his former wife did. But they have been feasting on the prospect for months, especially the mid-market Tory press. Rare is the week that passes without the Daily Mail or Daily Telegraph, both keen critics of David Cameron's coalition deal, taking a poke at the energy and climate change secretary as its most obstreperous symbol. There is much too poke at. Last spring Huhne did accuse the Tory party chairman, Lady Warsi, of making a \"Goebbels-like attack\" during the doomed AV referendum campaign, confronting David Cameron across the cabinet table until George Osborne called a halt. Last autumn he did indeed try to drop two Tory cabinet colleagues, Theresa May and Philip Hammond, in the cart for alleged personal misdemeanours which he compared to his own. Only this month the Telegraph led one edition with a claim that he'd leaked against a third, Michael Gove. This time Huhne extracted a retraction from the paper, not his first such win against the Telegraph. He is, as he admits, a \"sharp-elbowed\" politician. The trait was obvious in his brief, defiant statement on Friday. What is it about him that gets some people so cross? It is not confined to the media or critics of the coalition within the Tory ranks. Some Labour and Lib Dem MPs who respect the former energy secretary's brains and drive (not all do) do not warm to him personally. He was widely seen as double-crossing Ming Campbell in running for party leader when Charles Kennedy stood down in 2006 and of undermining his brief tenure. Born in July 1954, Christopher Murray Paul-Huhne (his surname until he went to Oxford) has always been something of a Marmite politician, attracting both loyalty and affection, as well as brickbats and disdain. The son of a west London businessman and an amateur actor (mum was once the voice of the speaking clock), he attended Westminster school, the high-powered private establishment Nick Clegg would later attend. At Oxford, Huhne obtained a first in politics, philosophy and economics (PPE), the degree of choice for aspiring politicos, while finding time to edit the student magazine, Isis (did he then advocate the decriminalisation of many drugs, he can't remember?), and play an active role in Labour university politics. He attended the Sorbonne and went into journalism via reporting during Indira Gandhi's Indian emergency, followed by stints on the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, later the Economist. In the turbulent early 80s, he joined the Guardian's economics team and in 1981 joined the Labour breakaway party, the SDP. Along with Malcolm Dean, Polly Toynbee and John Torode, in the 1983 general election he was one of four staff members who contested Tory-held seats for the party. In the post-Falklands Thatcher landslide, none won. The following year he married Pryce, a divorced mother of two. The couple had three children together. But Huhne was already more focused and ambitious than most colleagues. After further boosting his award-laden CV as business editor at both Independent titles (handling the Robert Maxwell fraud case, he took the advice that worldly politicians like Michael Heseltine or the late Peter Walker often give young men: \"Make some money before you try to become an MP. It will give you more confidence and independence.\" It was Heseltine and Walker who most successfully stood up to Thatcher). Huhne's route was to set up Sovereign Ratings, a City ratings company that examined the wisdom of investment in different countries; moving up through Fitch, the smallest of the big three rating agencies that allocate those vital AAA ratings and remove them from troubled firms and states. When he was elected the second of two Lib Dem MEPs for the south-east England region in 1999, he stayed on as a vice-chairman of Fitch until 2003. As a seasoned media operator at Strasbourg he caught the attention of his former Economist colleagues, who rated him the third-highest profile UK MEP – after Glenys Kinnock and the Green, Caroline Lucas. Unsurprisingly his areas of expertise were economic and financial policy. He took on the European commission and helped open the secretive ECB to greater scrutiny. But like many MEPs he preached Europe but had an eye on the domestic political arena. In 2005 – and by just 568 votes – he won the once-Tory Hampshire seat of Eastleigh and began his rapid ascent at Westminster. At least part of the antagonism to him arises from his unexpected rise to cabinet authority in a Lib Dem-Tory coalition few could ever have imagined happening – Huhne included. Huhne was a Lib Dem negotiator in the Lib-Con coalition agreement, but the more emollient Clegg set the tone. It is one of the great counter-factuals of current Westminster politics to wonder whether the Clegg-Cameron love-in in the No 10 rose garden on 12 May 2010 would have taken place if the prickly and far less accommodating Huhne had won the Lib Dem leadership in 2007. It later transpired that he probably did win – once the postal votes, delayed in the Christmas mail rush, had been counted. By then it was too late. The party establishment leaned Clegg's way, not least because they felt Huhne had earlier breached an informal deal with other potential candidates that they would give Campbell a clear run after Kennedy's drink-related resignation in January 2006. According to some accounts he went to tell Campbell of his change of mind, talked for 90 minutes and agreed not to stand after all, then came back 30 minutes later saying he would. In 2007, after campaigning against Tony Blair's \"surveillance state\" and for green taxes to fund lower income tax for the poorest – the \"green tax switch\" – he lost by 26,628 votes to 29,697 and was promoted from No 2 in the Lib Dem Treasury team to be environment spokesman, where he developed his critique of Cameron's use of green rhetoric to detoxify the Tory brand. The 2007 campaign was marked by dirty tricks charges against the Huhne camp by the man he (allegedly) dubbed \"Calamity Clegg\". But Huhne's energy remained essential and he took up the new leader's old post in home affairs with typical gusto. Despite claiming a Corby trouser press – and the Telegraph's best efforts – he survived the MPs' expenses scandals with the 418th ranking out of 650 for total expenses. His own assets – including flats which earn him a reported £80,000 a year – had been put into a blind trust. Appointed energy and climate change secretary with the Cameron ally, Greg Barker, as his deputy, Huhne had a mixed record in office. Lib Dem colleagues speak of his focused and business-like approach and praise him as a team player. Tory colleagues who dislike him admit he is smart. But he was seen to have executed a U-turn on the need for nuclear power and was wrong-footed when the coalition's feed-in tariff policy – part of the \"green deal\" package – was deemed too expensive and halted mid-track. Friends say he squared up to problems like the expected energy gap, which Labour had ducked. But as the recession pushed Cameron's green agenda down his priority list he was also criticised. Huhne was making enemies by his willingness to challenge Tory shibboleths in public and in his confident, abrasive way. Even among Lib Dems he lacked a fan club. \"He is not a folk hero,\" says one MP. Yet it was his private life that caught him out. Shortly after he saved his Eastleigh seat in 2010 it was revealed that he was having an affair with his media adviser, Carina Trimingham. Serious serial philanderers – the Alan Clark kind of politicians – handle such crises more adroitly than the amateurs. Pryce, a well-known Whitehall economist (unlike him, she, a Greek, opposed the euro) and Huhne's wife of 26 years (\"I thought we were a unit,\" she later said), reacted with anger and filed for divorce. Shortly afterwards the claims about Huhne's alleged points switch on the M11 emerged in the media. On BBC Radio Scotland, the ex-MP, Lembit Opik, said: \"Nick Clegg will not be sorry because Chris still wanted to be leader.\" That now seems more unlikely than ever. But Huhne is a fighter, who is not beaten yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/28/blowing-hot-and-cold-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-28T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: Blowing hot and cold on windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/28/blowing-hot-and-cold-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/28/blowing-hot-and-cold-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"Blowing hot and cold on windfarms","bodyText":"Adair Turner is right to say that there is a legitimate debate over the visual impact of windfarms (Debate whether windfarms are ugly but not their efficiency, says government adviser, 27 February). The Campaign to Protect Rural England believes that climate change poses a major threat to the character and quality of England's countryside, and wind energy will play an important role in helping to mitigate its impact. But in doing so we must not ignore other established environmental objectives such as protecting the open countryside from damaging development. The potential impact of windfarms on the landscape means that their location and extent needs to be carefully controlled. We have been calling for some time for a national debate about how to reconcile these two competing environmental objectives – protecting the landscape from intrusive development while ensuring we address the urgent need to tackle climate change. A planning system which is democratic and takes account of landscape capacity will be best placed to promote renewable energy while protecting our cherished countryside. Tom Leveridge Senior energy campaigner, CPRE • Among all the pages of reporting on wind power in Monday's Guardian, buried in the interview with Adair Turner is the key to the acceptance of windfarms by local communities (as with so many other developments): money – who gets richer and who gets poorer. Yes, there are those against turbines in principle, but I am sure they would have little influence but for the legions of people, and Conservative supporters at that, who equate the view of nearby turbines with a reduction in the value of their house. If that factor were addressed in some realistic way, I am convinced most of the opposition would melt away. David Mills Holme-on-Spalding-Moor, North Yorkshire • I was troubled to read that most of the largest onshore and offshore wind companies in the world are thinking of not investing in the UK renewable energy market because of a perception of a lack of formal support from the government for such projects (Tory backlash takes wind out of green boom, 27 February). I wish Mr Cameron had recently been signing an Anglo-French treaty on renewables, instead of wasting time and vast resources developing the white elephants that will be new nuclear power stations. With the Daily Telegraph accurately noting that most of the profits and jobs for new nuclear will not be in UK hands, I find it bizarre that the government is prepared to miss out on a renewable jobs and finance bonanza at a time when our economy really needs a major boost. Your Scottish analogy hits the nail on the head – Scotland will be getting a £1bn investment because there is settled policy support for wind power. I wholeheartedly agree with the need for a honest debate on our energy needs – it is clear to me that, if we did, the answer would be for renewables, and generations to come would thanks us for mitigating climate change and providing us with clean, safe and sustainable energy. Cllr Brian Goodall Chair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities • Interesting to see how few wind turbines are planned for the south-east (The wind war, 27 February): doesn't the wind blow there? Jenny Haynes Horkstow, North Lincolnshire • Like many in the renewable energy sector, I was pleased to read that the prime minister has strongly defended the government's plans for onshore wind power despite criticism from his own MPs (PM rejects backbenchers' plea on wind power, 22 February). David Cameron's letter in response to more than 100 of his own backbenchers who had called for the scrapping of subsidies for \"inefficient\" onshore wind power is reassuring to the renewable energy industry. And we are very grateful that the government also acknowledges the role co-operative and community-led renewable energy initiatives can play. Co-operatively-owned wind energy projects not only offer the opportunity for people up and down the country to make a positive contribution to the issues of climate change but also enable members of the public to purchase a stake in such projects and receive an annual share interest payment from the income. John Malone Development director, Energy4All • I was not particularly ill-disposed to wind turbines until one was erected 120 metres from my house in the Waveney valley on the Norfolk-Suffolk border. They are not static objects like pylons: the constant whirring of the blades – clearly visible from my kitchen – is a constant visual irritation. Second, there is the noise – a high-pitched whining that is an intrusion day and night, especially in one's garden. Fortunately we have managed to get this one turned off, for the time being. People who advocate wind turbines are either greedy for money or just plain daft. Developers are more than happy to make use of naive Green support. For my part, I support those Tory MPs on this matter (though probably not on many others). Geoff Hinchliffe Palgrave, Suffolk • I question why David Cameron has chosen to axe windfarms across the UK (Windfarms axed as UK loses its tastes for turbines, 27 February). There is considerable public support for wind energy, and with the right infrastructure we can ensure it creates a more reliable, cost-effective and renewable energy supply for the UK. The government's energy policy seems unclear and ever-changing; we need a consensus to ensure that the UK is able to meet its energy requirements. Without this, the UK faces an uncertain future with doubts over whether we can meet the energy needs of the future. Andrew Jones Managing director, S&amp;C Electric Europe • Britain and Ireland, in contrast to countries on the continent, have very poor connections to the European electricity network. We cannot easily import power at times of low wind energy, and rely very heavily on combined-cycle gas-fired plants for backup. But by 2020 Britain will be importing 90% of its gas, which puts both the gas and electricity system at risk. Coal is an alternative for power production, but coal-fired plants are not good at coping with wind intermittency. It would be more sensible to gasify the coal and use it to reduce our dangerous dependency on imported gas. Coal-derived gas would be used to fuel backup power plants as well as for central heating, etc. And for once Britain will be in a strong position technologically, having sold gasifiers to Germany and China that produce a substitute natural gas. Fred Starr Claverton Energy Group • Ten days ago a small local company installed 18 solar PV panels for us. They were producing electricity before the workers went home. The process took a few weeks from inquiry to completion. When we told him what was going on, our farmer neighbour, said \"if everyone did this there wouldn't be any need for those things\", indicating the local turbines with his thumb. Six years ago when we looked into the possibility of solar PV, we couldn't find any useful information, let alone source the panels themselves. The UK's belated adoption of feed-in tariffs has changed the basis of all UK renewables questions and should change investment strategies. Perhaps previous UK governments who legalised Renewables Obligation Certificates, \"streamlined\" the planning process in relation to turbine noise, and generally encouraged the spread of wind turbines bigger and deeper into the hillsides than most existing buildings, believed they were doing this for the environment and for UK industry. Unfortunately they were wrong on both counts. It's still not clear that politicians, energy companies and investors are ready to engage realistically with people in the UK, a majority I believe, who want to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and increase investment in UK industries: but maybe that is beginning to happen. Janet Dubé Gwyddgrug, Carmarthenshire • The Guardian's focus on the Tory backlash against wind energy and the myth that wind power is unfairly subsidised is welcome. The 2011 World Energy Outlook, produced by the International Energy Agency (IEA), states that worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels in 2010 totalled $409bn. By comparison, renewable energy systems received just $66bn. The IEA is calling for a significant increase in subsidies to renewables because of their long-term economic and environmental benefits. Subsidies to fossil fuels, by comparison, are unwelcome because the \"costs outweigh the benefits\". A recent study by the European Environment Agency gives an indication of some of these costs. It estimates that the damage to human health and the environment from air pollution released in the European Union in 2009, mainly from burning fossil fuels, amounted to £145 billion. A similar study, published by the New York Academy of Sciences, concluded that the price of electricity generated from burning coal would have to be at least doubled if it took account of the environmental and health damage it caused. Once these \"external costs\" are included, renewable energy systems become much more economically viable. Despite the numerous obstacles faced by renewable energy development in the UK, the economy is already reaping noticeable benefits. In January, the government announced that, since 1 April last year, companies have agreed to invest almost £2.5bn in renewable energy projects in the UK. This is expected to create 11,600 jobs. We should not allow the immense challenges of both cutting carbon dioxide emissions and creating jobs to be undermined by landscapists who, as Lord Turner stated, ignore the facts and believe what they want to believe. Gordon James Llanfallteg, West Wales • Anyone who cares about wildlife and the climate will be relieved to hear the news that Drax is abandoning plans for a huge biomass power plant in Yorkshire that alone would have consumed about 1.9 million tonnes of wood each year (Drax scraps plan for two biomass power stations, citing lack of government cash, 22 February). The government must act now to ensure other \"forest burner\" power plants share the same fate. Last year the RSPB launched an investigation into plans for biomass power stations in the UK. We found 39 biomass plants proposed or in development as a result of generous government subsidies. Most of these intended to import wood from countries like the US, Brazil and Canada to generate electricity – in total they would be responsible for importing 39 million tonnes of biomass every year. This compares to the 10m tonnes of wood that is harvested from UK forests each year. Clearly, this would be a disaster for the climate and for wildlife as forests are felled and wood is transported across the world. That's why the RSPB has been campaigning for subsidies for new biomass power plant to be removed, in favour of genuinely green renewable energy like wind, wave and solar power.

The documentary, What the Green Movement Got Wrong, is a 75-minute film featuring what Channel 4 describes as \"life-long, diehard greens\" pushing radical solutions because they believe that traditional environmentalists are out of date and are now failing their own cause. In the documentary, which will screen on 4 November, Brand argues that an \"overly romanticised\" view of nature is blocking a pragmatic approach to saving the planet. Lynas, who in the 1990s was part of environmental direct action groups, will say the lack of impact of the green lobby over the years is down to \"crying wolf\" too often. He now supports nuclear power as a viable option for environmental sustainability. What The Green Movement Got Wrong, commissioned by Channel 4 head of news and current affairs Dorothy Byrne, will be followed by a 45-minute live studio debate chaired by news anchor Jon Snow. \"There are ongoing lively and important debates within the environmental movement,\" said Byrne. \"This film is providing a platform for the alternative views of a group of pioneering thinkers who offer new radical solutions to the environmental problems facing the planet.\" The documentary is being made by independent producer Darlow Smithson.

In particular, the loss by the ruling Popolo della Liberta (PDL) of the city of Milan – Silvio Berlusconi's hometown – after 18 years of solid centre-right administration, is considered by all sides to mark the beginning of the end of the Berlusconi era. The day after, the piazza of the Duomo was packed with anti-Berlusconi voters celebrating the change. \"Thank you, Milan\" is the underlying substance of the most shared messages on Facebook and Twitter as well. The day after the ballots in Milan, Naples, Trieste and Cagliari, to name the four most important local contests in which the centre-left made a clean sweep, there has been a unanimous reaction among analysts and public opinion polls. This was not a ballot about the mayors and other local authorities, it was a ballot about Berlusconi. Even the right wing admits the defeat: \"A blow for Silvio\" is the headline on Libero. An editorial in La Stampa sums it up thus: \"The Cavaliere lost his magic.\" In typical fashion Berlusconi was not in the country to respond. He made a sneering comment from Romania, where he is on an official trip, that he was \"too busy to go to his own funeral\". But it's a defensive joke, in which defeat is tacitly admitted. Even his interior minister Roberto Maroni, from the coalition party Lega Nord, says the electoral results are a slap in the face for Berlusconi. The Lega is evaluating the damage it may have suffered by sticking too closely to Silvio, and considering whether to detach itself from him in order not to lose touch with its base of northern separatists. Of course, Berlusconi suffered even worse results in 2005, at the end of his first term, when he was beaten by Romano Prodi, but he recovered within two years and was re-elected. However, this time he seems worn out by all the scandals. And even the most optimistic members of the PDL are sceptical about a quick recovery, foreseeing a bumpy ride towards a possible national congress next year to nominate a successor to Berlusconi. They hope postponing the problem until then will give Berlusconi a better chance to keep going until 2013, when his term in office ends naturally. But this is wishful thinking on the part of Berlusconi's supporters, because the opposition now seems finally to have found the courage to speak up. Pierluigi Bersani, leader of the Democratic party, is hoping to close this parliament with an emergency government, while the more leftist Nicky Vendola, leader of the Sinistra e Libertà (Left and Freedom) breakaway grouping, dreams of new elections altogether. \"There is a time for rebellion of the pure and simple common sense … People are fed up with Berlusconi for the simple reason that they don't want to sink with him,\" writes Antonio Padellaro in Il Fatto. There is a moment in which even a country that has seemed lobotomised can react. Berlusconi will resist, holding on to the illusion that all can be fixed, as he always did. He will make promises, threats, he will buy this or that. But he knows it is over. The next reckoning is in two weeks – on 12 and 13 June – with the referendum on whether to scrap the \"legitimate impediment\" (which protects Berlusconi from being tried) and on the privatisation of water and on nuclear power, which the government has boycotted and hopes won't get the quorum. But after the huge turnout in these local ballots to crush Berlusconism, the opposition hopes the majority of citizens will hang in there for a last push and let him know loud and clear that he is no longer representing Italy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2010/aug/05/us-vietnam-nuclear-negotiations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-05T17:54:09Z","webTitle":"US and Vietnam in nuclear negotiations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/05/us-vietnam-nuclear-negotiations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/aug/05/us-vietnam-nuclear-negotiations","fields":{"headline":"US and Vietnam in controversial nuclear negotiations","bodyText":"The US is said to be negotiating a controversial agreement with Vietnam to provide nuclear fuel and technology without the usual constraints on enriching uranium to prevent proliferation. The deal has been under discussion for several months following Hanoi's announcement of plans to build 14 nuclear power stations over the next 20 years, according to the Wall Street Journal. Washington has required several other countries, most recently the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, to agree to source all their nuclear fuel on the international market and to renounce the right to enrich uranium as a requirement for assistance in developing nuclear power. Vietnam signed an initial memorandum of understanding on nuclear power with the Bush administration in 2001. But the Obama administration has accelerated talks in recent months as Vietnam reaches agreements with other countries including Russia which has been contracted to begin building a light water reactor for $8bn in 2014. The US and Vietnam signed a new memorandum of understanding in April over broad co-operation on nuclear power including access to \"reliable sources of nuclear fuel\". An agreement would allow US companies such as General Electric and Bechtel to sell nuclear reactors and other equipment to Vietnam. But the talks have drawn criticism that Washington is setting a different standard for Vietnam than some other countries. Henry Sokolski, director of the Nonproliferation Education Centre in Washington, said the US agreeing to allow Hanoi to produce its own nuclear fuel would undermine anti-proliferation efforts. \"After the US set such a good example with the UAE, the Vietnam deal not only sticks out, it could drive a stake through the heart of the general effort to rein in the spread of nuclear fuel-making,\" he told the Wall Street Journal. However, Vietnam has said it is not interested in producing its own nuclear fuel because it would be diplomatically sensitive to do so. Hanoi has also signed nuclear co-operation agreements with several other countries including China, France and India. The state department did not respond to questions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/mar/15/ayrshire-power-station-new-kingsnorth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-15T16:13:49Z","webTitle":"Climate activists predict direct action campaign against Scotland's 'Kingsnorth'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/15/ayrshire-power-station-new-kingsnorth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/mar/15/ayrshire-power-station-new-kingsnorth","fields":{"headline":"Climate activists predict direct action against Scotland's 'Kingsnorth'","bodyText":"Climate activists are predicting a campaign of direct action against a new coal-fired power station that could be the UK's first to fit carbon-capture technology. Campaigners say that if the proposed 1.6GW station in Ayrshire is approved, it will be the \"new Kingsnorth\", a reference to E.ON's controversial coal-fired plant in Kent that sparked battles between protesters and police before E.ON finally shelved it. The warnings from Friends of the Earth (FoE) Scotland, WWF Scotland and the World Development Movement came as Ayrshire Power today took the first formal step towards applying for planning permission for the new station, at Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde. The proposal has intensified the conflicts between green campaigners, power companies and the government over \"decarbonising\" energy supply and lessening the UK's heavy reliance on coal and gas for its electricity needs. Juliet Swann, of FoE Scotland, said many local residents and a \"large coalition\" of environment groups would resist the scheme. It would increase the UK's use of coal, and, at first, use untested carbon capture and storage technology to tackle only a quarter of its CO2 emissions. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves trapping a percentage of the carbon dioxide emissions from power stations by collecting, transporting and then burying the CO2 so that it does not escape into the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. Carbon capture should first be used on existing power stations, such as Longannet, which is one of two coal-fired stations in the running for a new carbon-capture demonstration project, Swann said. \"Carbon capture and storage is potentially a way to reach a low-carbon future,\" she said. \"But it should be demonstrated on existing plants first, not least so we can share the technology with the rest of the world, and in doing so repay our debt to them for supplying us with so much of our dirty energy.\" The dispute also focuses attention on the Scottish government's determination to abandon nuclear power, which generates at least 26% of Scotland's electricity, by increasing coal-fired production. The proposed station is near to Hunterston B nuclear station, which is due to close down in 2016; Scotland's other nuclear station, at Torness, will shut down in 2023. Energy planning in Scotland is controlled by ministers in Edinburgh, while ministers in London control funding for carbon capture and energy taxation across the UK. The first minister, Alex Salmond, has championed carbon capture and the coal industry while at the same time insisting Scotland can become a \"green powerhouse\" from renewable energy. To the fury of campaigners and local residents, Salmond's government aims to fast track the Hunterston proposal by using a new streamlined planning process, bypassing the often lengthy and expensive public-consultation rules that normally apply. Residents are already challenging this move in court, claiming ministers illegally added Hunterston to the list of fast-track projects on the \"national planning framework\" without consulting them properly. With the UK pledging to cut CO2 emissions by up to 42% by 2020, Ayrshire Power plans to make Hunterston the first newly built coal-fired plant in the UK to \"capture\" CO2 emissions and store them under the seabed. New legislation requires power companies to fit carbon-capture technology for at least 300MW of its output. Ayrshire Power says 400MW (25% of its emissions) will be captured first, and, eventually, 90% of its CO2 emissions. But Ayrshire Power admits it will need another £1bn – mostly from the UK government's carbon-capture funding programme – to pay for the CCS technology on top of the £2bn cost of building the power station. The project has already suffered a serious blow after one of its original developers, the giant Danish power company Dong, withdrew from the proposal only days after E.ON suspended its plans for Kingsnorth. Like E.ON, Dong also cited the recession and the heavy cost of investing in \"clean coal\". Ayrshire Power's sole owner, the Manchester-based airports and property firm Peel Holdings, admits it now needs significant new investors in the Hunterston project, feeding doubts that it will go ahead. Ayrshire Power began the first stage in the fast-track process today under a new \"gate check\" procedure, where the government and statutory bodies check the company has the right documentation for the planning process. It has not confirmed when it will formally submit its full application. Muir Miller, Hunterston's project director, said the plant would use up to 25% less coal than power stations now in use, by using biofuels and \"supercritical\" technology to burn coal at higher temperatures. The station would power 3 million homes. \"We believe our proposal supports the UK and Scottish governments' commitment to leading the way in developing CCS to assist in decarbonising the UK's electricity sector by 2030,\" he said. \"We remain determined to deploy this technology at full scale on a modern supercritical power station, supported by appropriate regulatory and fiscal measures.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/11/independent-inquiry-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-11T00:05:08Z","webTitle":"Academics demand independent inquiry into new nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/11/independent-inquiry-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/11/independent-inquiry-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Academics demand independent inquiry into new nuclear reactors","bodyText":"Pressure on the government to organise an independent inquiry into a new generation of nuclear power stations will intensify today with a call for action from a group of 90 high-ranking academics, politicians and technical experts. The huge lobby says the \"climategate\" email scandal and other events have shaken public trust in the scientific governance of environmental risk, making a wider assessment of nuclear power more important than ever. Paul Dorfman, an energy policy research fellow at Warwick University who has been coordinating support for an inquiry, said more debate was needed for a decision on nuclear to have full democratic backing. \"The kind of consultation we have had so far has been flawed and inadequate. The government has put the cart before the horse by wanting endorsement before either the design of the reactor and the way waste will be treated has been decided. There is a democratic deficit here that needs correcting,\" he said. Nuclear consulting engineer John Large, another campaign signatory, agreed. \"The public consultation has been a failure because the appropriate information has not been made available for the public to make a proper assessment of the benefits and risks,\" he said. \"We need Ed Miliband [the energy and climate change secretary] to organise an independent inquiry as he is entitled to do under the justification regulations,\" he added. These two critics are standing alongside a long list of academics, such as Jerome Ravetz of Oxford University and Mark Pelling of King's College London, as well as MPs including Simon Hughes of the Liberal Democrats, Michael Meacher from Labour and Jane Davidson, the environment minister in the Welsh assembly. A \"justification\" process is a requirement under European Union law but Miliband will himself be able to decide whether he needs an inquiry or not. He is believed to want to take this step as soon as possible so that new nuclear power stations could come on stream in 2017, in time to meet an expected energy shortage. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was unable to comment on the matter last night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/02/naoto-kan-japan-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-02T17:07:00Z","webTitle":"Japan PM tells Fukushima nuclear plant workers to hold firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/02/naoto-kan-japan-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/02/naoto-kan-japan-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Japan PM tells Fukushima nuclear plant workers to hold firm","bodyText":"Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, will tell workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to \"fight with the conviction that you absolutely cannot lose\", as highly radioactive water continued to seep into the sea. The discovery by officials of a 20cm crack in the wall of a concrete pit could explain the continued flow of contaminated water that has jeopardised the operation to calm the reactors and raised fears about radiation levels in the sea and nearby soil. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said that it would pour concrete into the pit, where a radiation reading of 1,000 millisieverts per hour has been recorded, to try to seal the crack. Workers have taken samples of the water in the pit and seawater to determine the level of contamination. Experts said that while the leak was a cause for concern, radiation would be quickly diluted in the ocean. \"With radiation levels rising in seawater next to the plant we have been trying to confirm why that's happening, and [the crack] could be one source,\" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency. The plant, 240km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, will continue to leak radiation until four of its six reactors have been reconnected to cooling systems that were knocked out by the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. An artificial \"floating island\" is being towed to the plant to store contaminated water, samples of which have shown radiation levels 4,000 times the legal limit. The vast tanker could store about 10,000 tonnes, Tepco said; an estimated 13,000 tonnes of contaminated water has collected beneath some of the reactors. \"We are trying to employ as many measures as possible to regain control,\" a Tepco official said, adding that he had \"high hopes\" for the storage vessel. Radiation levels in the plant and its vicinity have reached such high levels that Tepco is looking to hire special workers prepared to enter contaminated areas to perform essential tasks before rushing out to avoid prolonged exposure. In return for their bravery it is reported that the \"jumpers\" are being offered up to £3,000 a shift. Kan has been to visit an evacuation centre in the coastal town of Rikuzentakata, which was engulfed by the tsunami. Most of its 23,000 residents were killed or injured. He later entered the 20km zone around the plant from which 70,000 people have been evacuated. He told Tepco workers, troops and firefighters : ''I want you to fight with the conviction that you absolutely cannot lose this battle.\" Police said that more than 11,800 people had been confirmed dead in the disaster, while more than 15,540 people remained missing. More than 165,000 people are living in shelters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/15/yakuza-swaps-charity-for-reconstruction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-15T13:44:28Z","webTitle":"Japanese underworld tries to cash in on tsunami clean-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/15/yakuza-swaps-charity-for-reconstruction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/15/yakuza-swaps-charity-for-reconstruction","fields":{"headline":"Japanese underworld tries to cash in on tsunami clean-up","bodyText":"In the aftermath of the devastating March tsunami, Japan's underworld made a rare display of philanthropy, handing out emergency supplies to survivors, sometimes days before aid agencies arrived. Three months later, however, the yakuza appears to have dispensed with largesse and is instead hoping to cash in on the daunting clean-up effort in dozens of ruined towns and villages. The government and police fear they are losing the battle to prevent crime syndicates from winning lucrative contracts to remove millions of tonnes of debris left in the tsunami's wake, including contaminated rubble near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that many firms are reluctant to handle. The disaster created almost 24m tonnes of debris in the three hardest-hit prefectures, Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate, according to the environment ministry. So far, just over 5m tonnes – or 22% – has been removed. Those lining up to profit from the clearance operation, which is expected to take three years, include homegrown gangs and Chinese crime syndicates, according to the June edition of Sentaku, a respected political and economic affairs magazine. The magazine recounts the story of a leading Chinese gangster who, accompanied by a national politician, visited the mayor of Minamisoma – a town near Fukushima Daiichi, where a partial evacuation order is in place – hoping to win contracts to remove radioactive waste that, according to police, could have ended up at disposal sites in China. The man, named in the article as Mr X, had reportedly ingratiated himself with the local authorities by handing out free food to people living in evacuation centres. The mayor had no knowledge of the man's underworld connections, the magazine said. \"If they help citizens, it's hard for the police to say anything bad,\" said Tomohiko Suzuki, a journalist who has written several books on the Japanese underworld. \"The yakuza are trying to position themselves to gain contracts for their construction companies for the massive rebuilding that will come.\" An unnamed senior gangster countered in the Weekly Taishuu magazine: \"It takes too long for the arm of the government to reach out here so it's important to do it now. Our honest sentiment right now is to be of some use to people.\" In the days after the tsunami, the wealthiest yakuza gangs reportedly sent dozens of trucks loaded with water, nappies, instant noodles, blankets and other supplies worth an estimated half a million dollars to the stricken region. The race to profit from the operation to remove what is left of wrecked buildings and gain a share of the reconstruction budget is expected to intensify in the coming months. Officials have said that the removal of debris should come under central government control, and the names of \"antisocial\" individuals have been forwarded to local authorities. But given the sheer quantity of debris, and the manpower required to remove and dispose of it, few believe Japan's most powerful yakuza gangs will be kept out altogether. The police's job has been complicated by the emergence of yakuza front companies that, without time-consuming investigations, are impossible to distinguish from legitimate businesses. As Sentaku notes: \"It appears to be an uphill battle to prevent the yakuza and other crime syndicates from benefiting from the multitrillion-yen reconstruction projects.\" Traditionally, construction has been a dependable well of cash from which the yakuza, with an estimated nationwide membership of 80,000, has supped long and often. \"The nexus of massive construction projects, bureaucrats, politicians, businessmen and yakuza are as revealing about Japan as they are about Italy and Russia,\" Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo, wrote in his recent book, Contemporary Japan. \"In Japan, the yakuza cut on construction projects is estimated at 3%, a vast sum that keeps them afloat, given that during the 1990s the public works budget was on par with the US Pentagon's budget and remains quite high despite huge cutbacks.\" It is not the first time the yakuza has revealed its usually well-hidden philanthropic side. After the western port city of Kobe was struck by an earthquake in January 1995, members of the locally based Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's biggest crime syndicate, were among the first to hand out food and water to survivors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2010/dec/23/photography1","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-31T13:47:54Z","webTitle":"January assignment: utilities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/23/photography1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/23/photography1","fields":{"headline":"January assignment: utilities","bodyText":"December's assignment proved to be a warming distraction from this winter's atrocious weather.

But that is what they are going to get – in return for getting a climate change bill through Congress. Last night Obama delivered the signal Congress – and much of the world – had been watching for that the White House is ready to throw itself into the effort to get a climate change bill through the Senate. But what kind of bill? One deliberately crafted to prise off at least a handful of Republican votes – which means expanding nuclear power, offshore drilling, and money for clean coal technology. \"That means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies,\" Obama said in his state of the union address. That is not a recipe to make the enviros happy. But Senators John Kerry and Lindsey Graham who are trying to craft a compromise bill are going to be relieved. The two told reporters earlier today there was no hope of getting a bill through the Senate without getting a few Republicans on side and in their wake – hopefully – a few of those Democrats from coal, oil and old industrial states. The appeal to conservaties is probably why Obama only once uttered the words \"climate change\", let alone \"global warming\". But there were enough references to \"clean energy jobs\" to remove any doubts that Obama still sees green investment as key to America's economic future. The president also endorsed a \"comprehensive energy and climate bill\" – code in Washington for a broad set of proposals that would also include establishment of a cap and trade programme. \"And yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.\" And he said he wanted a bill through the Senate in 2010 – timing that is seen as crucial both for the prospects of energy reform in America and for getting a global change deal. \"This year, I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate,\" he said.\" Before the speech, Hill rats had put the chances of getting a bill through the Senate at between 0 and 40%.

Weekend state-level election results in Germany, however, suggest that voters who stayed in work and funds throughout the recession are just as unimpressed with the parties of power as those who have fared far worse. In the prosperous state of Baden-Württemberg, where the local economy is growing by an enviable 5.5% and unemployment is a mere 4.3%, voters this weekend threw out Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right CDU for the first time in half a century. In its place, they handed power to what is likely to become Germany's first Green party-led state coalition. Meanwhile in Rheinland-Pfalz, the CDU could not muster enough support to oust a tired state government led by the unpopular centre-left SPD; here again, a strong Green performance tipped the balance against Mrs Merkel's party. These are sensational results, particularly by German standards. The humiliation for the CDU is a huge one, with the loss of Baden-Württemberg following hard upon a bad defeat in Hamburg last month. The Green success is the third great step in the party's electoral history, following election to the Bundestag in 1983 and to coalition government in 1998. The results are a mixed bag for the SPD, which will be a party of government in both states even though its vote fell in both. But the real loser is Mrs Merkel's junior coalition ally, the liberal FDP. Its poor showing will increase the pressure on its leader Guido Westerwelle, the current foreign minister. None of this is immediately threatening to Mrs Merkel's government (the next federal election is not due until 2013). Yet it will revive talk about the CDU exploring other coalition options, including even with the Greens. It is not hard to see these elections as a verdict on the manoeuvrings on the nuclear power issue in the wake of the Fukushima reactor crisis – the CDU was punished and the Greens rewarded for Mrs Merkel's shameless U-turn this month – and also to suspect that such a combination of events will not operate with such potency in 2013. Yet the FDP's collapse poses a long-term threat to Mrs Merkel's preferred strategy, while the Green surge and the SDP doldrums point to possible realignment on the left. Mrs Merkel remains a skilful wielder of power. She has no obvious rival since the fall of her defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. Yet unless she can engineer a recovery of direction and fortune for one of the federal government coalition parties in the next two years, the German government faces a period of greater weakness at a time when Europe could use a period of greater German strength."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/28/kim-jong-il-funeral-thousands-mourn","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-28T10:48:41Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-il funeral: thousands mourn North Korean leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/28/kim-jong-il-funeral-thousands-mourn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/28/kim-jong-il-funeral-thousands-mourn","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-il funeral: thousands mourn North Korean leader","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of people have endured freezing temperatures in Pyongyang to bid farewell to the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in a meticulously-choreographed funeral designed to cement his legacy and transfer power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un. In death, as in life, Kim had kept the outside world guessing – this time about the timing of his funeral. The Russian and Chinese media said the images coming from Pyongyang on Wednesday were live, but the abundance of natural light at the end, just as it was getting dark in Seoul, suggested they were recorded. Reports said the capital's citizens had been mobilised to clear snow from the funeral cortege's 40km route from the Kumsusan memorial palace, where Kim's body had been lying in state. North Korean state TV showed the procession moving slowly through the streets against a backdrop of snowfall and a clearly audible outpouring of grief from mourners, most of whom were wearing dark green military uniforms. The three-hour procession may have helped answer key questions about the communist regime's immediate future amid fears that the rapid rise of the inexperienced Kim Jong-un could spark a power struggle and potentially threaten regional security. Kim Jong-un, wearing a long black coat but no hat, walked in front of the hearse carrying his father's casket which was wrapped in a red flag – a sign that the succession is proceeding as the older Kim had envisaged when he unveiled the youngest of his three sons as his heir at a military parade in October 2010. The younger Kim bowed his head slightly and held a military salute as the motorcade left the mausoleum grounds. Just behind him was Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law, Jang Song-thaek, whom many expect to help the new leader tighten his grip on power in the coming months. With them was Ri Yong-ho, the army's chief of staff, and other senior military officials. In front were cars carrying a large wreath draped with black ribbons and a huge portrait of a smiling Kim Jong-il dressed in his trademark khaki suit. Following them were about a dozen black Mercedes-Benz sedans and a larger fleet of white luxury cars. The only military vehicles on display were the Jeeps surrounding Kim Jong-il's hearse. The former leader's two other sons, Kim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-chol, did not appear in any of the footage. The early stages of the procession were watched by banks of soldiers, some of whom held on to each other for support. Women in civilian clothes further along the route shook with grief and clasped handkerchiefs to their mouths. Some in the crowd could be heard shouting: \"How could you leave us? What are we supposed to do without you?\" It was not immediately clear whether Kim Jong-il would be buried or embalmed and placed on permanent display next to the body of his father at the Kumsusan mausoleum. The funeral proceedings are expected to last for two days. On Thursday, a national memorial service will feature an artillery salute, to be followed by a three-minute silence at noon, and trains and ships sounding their horns in unison. Wednesday's procession was accompanied by a slow march by a military band and commentary from the same tearful newscaster who announced Kim Jong-il's death last week. In addition to eulogies, she said that under Jong-un's leadership, \"North Korea will experience only victories.\" The state media used the snowy weather to bolster myths about Kim Jong-il's birth in a log cabin on the Korean peninsula's highest peak, Mount Paektu, although Soviet records show he was born in Russia. \"The feathery snowfall reminds the Korean people of the snowy day when the leader was born in the secret camp of Mount Paektu and of the great revolutionary career that he followed through snowdrifts,\" the Korea Central News Agency said. \"It seems the sky knows well of how much he got snowed on during his uninterrupted field guidance tour for the happiness of the people.\" Citing the snowy weather, one soldier told North Korean state TV: \"A national tragedy has occurred … how could the sky not cry? The people are all crying tears of blood.\" Seo Ju-rim, a weeping female soldier, said: \"Seeing this white snow fall has made me think of the general's efforts, and this brings tears to my eyes.\" After its trawl through Pyongyang, the cortege arrived back at the memorial palace, with Jong-un again at the side of the hearse. Later, a 21-gun salute signalled the end of the proceedings. State media have sought to burnish Kim Jong-il's reputation as an inspired military leader who brought prosperity and progress to what, by any measure, is one of the world's poorest countries. He died of a heart attack on 17 December aged 69, leaving behind a country that is some way towards developing nuclear weapons as part of his \"military first\" policy. As soon as his death was announced last Monday – two days after the fact – there were fears that North Korean military elites, resentful of the younger Kim's rapid rise to power, could block his accession and plunge the country into chaos. Kim Jong-un, who is aged 28 or 29, had a little over a year to prepare for power after his first public appearance at a military parade in October 2010. Fears of a political vacuum appear to have been allayed, however, with senior military and officials from the ruling Workers' party reportedly pledging loyalty to him. North Korean media have started referring to him as \"supreme commander\" of the armed forces. The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the Workers' party, has also described him as the head of the party's central committee, one of the country's most powerful decision-making bodies. On Wednesday, state media declared that the country was now in the \"warm care\" of Kim Jong-un. He will be advised by a small group of \"senior revolutionaries\", including his aunt Kim Kyong-hui and uncle Jang Song-thaek, whose first task will be to ensure stability at least until the country marks the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth next April. Kim Jong-il had been expected to use the anniversary to pronounce North Korea a \"strong and prosperous nation\" and a bona fide nuclear power. Jong-un will continue to pursue the military first policy of his father, said Jeon Hyun-jun of the Korea Institute for National Unification. \"North Korea's economic crisis and security problems will not be solved easily in the future,\" he wrote in a commentary for the Daily NK website, adding that the term \"military first\" had appeared 21 times in Rodong Sinmun editorials on 22 December alone. Jeon said he believed the party and military would not oppose their new leader and that the weakest link is the people, whose loyalty to the regime has been weakened by glaring faults in the food distribution system. \"We must not fall into the trap of using a hardline policy towards North Korea,\" he wrote. \"Rather, we must let it be known that the rice of the North Korean people is not given by their general or supreme leader, but by the US and South Korea. We are in great need of a strategic plan.\" The younger Kim will inherit a country that is close to mounting nuclear warheads on its ballistic missiles, according to a US expert. Larry Niksch, who spent 43 years monitoring North Korea for the US congressional research service, said in a study that the regime could miniaturise and mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range Nodong missile within one or two years. Siegfried Hecker, the former head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said last year that the North's uranium enrichment programme was more advanced than had previously been thought. Hecker, who visited North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex in November 2010, believes the country would have to conduct a third nuclear test – the first two were conducted in 2006 and 2009 – to be certain that its warhead technology was sound. \"If the test is successful they may be able to have the capability within a couple of years,\" he told Reuters. \"We simply don't know what else they have and how much highly enriched uranium they can make or have made.\" Before the funeral coverage started, about four hours later than scheduled, North Korean state TV was showing archive footage of Kim Jong-il's early days as leader, including his vaunted trips to farms and factories to offer \"field guidance\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2012/jul/15/pd-james-author-interview-readers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-14T23:05:28Z","webTitle":"PD James: inside the head of a criminal mastermind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/15/pd-james-author-interview-readers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/jul/15/pd-james-author-interview-readers","fields":{"headline":"PD James: inside the head of a criminal mastermind","bodyText":"At 10 o'clock PD James – or Baroness James of Holland Park, OBE – walks into her sitting room. We last met almost 20 years ago in the same room and there is, along with the deja vu, a sense of wonder at seeing her again. At 91, she is remarkable. She is looking marvellous in an elegant powder-blue jacket of oriental cut, offset by a narrow silk scarf decorated with flowers. She is frailer than when last we met (she has survived heart failure and had a hip replaced in 2007) but otherwise is unchanged and in no way extinguished. She is as kind, civil and forthright as I remember. Her secretary, friend and all-round prop, Joyce McLennan, has tea and biscuits ready on the table. Everything is in order – above all, PD James's shipshape mind. Incidentally, P and D stand for Phyllis and Dorothy. It is splendid, she volunteers, to be answering questions from readers and fellow authors. She avoids being insulting yet her view is implicit: journalists are less likely to be armed with surprising questions. As a crime writer, surprise is PD James's forte. Her ability to keep readers guessing has not failed her in half a century. And it is characteristic that, towards the end of her writing life, she should elect to spring a new surprise on us. It would have been pardonable – admirable indeed – to have published another novel starring policeman poet Adam Dalgliesh. But Death Comes to Pemberley (now out in paperback) is a plucky new adventure, a sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that doubles as a murder novel. PD James has been an Austen devotee all her life. She can hear Austen's voice with her inner ear, become her echo on the page. Death Comes to Pemberley is a masterly pastiche. It is more streamlined than her other fiction, involving only one murder and one suspect, but it fills us in on Elizabeth and Darcy and their marriage and satisfies that curiosity one has as the reader of a classic romance: did they live happily ever after? And what of PD James's own happiness? Everything about the room and its occupant has a secure, reassuring feel: the William Morris upholstery, the trusty fireplace, the sage green walls, a flourishing orchid and statues – some of them religious. She has a study lined with poetry, a garden busy with geraniums, but the metal security bars on the windows introduce a different note. She prefers not to dwell on her earlier life's difficulties. But it is interesting that, asked about what matters, she talks – in a manner of which Jane Austen would have approved – about the importance of security and a good marriage when, for a while, she had neither. She was married to Connor Bantry White, an army doctor, and had two daughters by him: Clare and Jane. Tragically, her husband returned from the war mentally ill – and she had to support the family single-handedly. He died, aged 44, in 1964, two years after her first novel, Cover Her Face, was published. It must have been extraordinarily hard. But PD James is, one surmises, the sort of person who would only be made more determined by misfortune. Besides, she was not unused to being pitched into helping a family out. For, in a sense, history was repeating itself. She left school at 16 and helped bring up her younger siblings. Her family was short of money and her father, a tax inspector, did not approve of higher education for girls. And there was another reason too: her mother had been admitted to a mental hospital. PD James has always been a powerhouse. As if it were not enough to be a living legend as a crime writer, she also worked (until 1979) in the NHS and Home Office police and criminal law department. She is a Conservative life peer and has been a magistrate, a BBC governor, on the board of the Arts Council, a chair of the Booker prize, a lay patron of the Prayer Book Society. Idleness is alien to her. And while, in one sense, she could be seen as a distinguished, conservative, C of E pillar of the community, there is another in which she cannot be defined through any institution. That is not to say she is not intrigued by institutions – they are an essential part of her writing (a theological college, a publishing house, a barristers' chambers, the criminal justice system – each has a novel to itself). But PD James is, above all, an independent thinker. On New Year's Eve 2009, she attracted widespread attention by giving that independent thought air time. It was while guest editing the Today programme that she took on the BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, and politely asked him bullseye questions. She wanted to know why the BBC's middle management were paid such overblown salaries and why creative people were not better recompensed. Thompson was not ready for her. The interview won the 2010 Nick Clarke award. PD James has a special place in her readers' lives. When I explain to a friend we cannot meet because I am interviewing her, his response is: \"Excuses don't come any better.\" And I feel hugely indebted to her because it was the Dalgliesh novels that saw me through the sleepless months after my first son was born. That magnificent narrative grip, the Victorian and the visceral together: the capaciousness coupled with violent detail… her books were powerful enough to keep even a shattered new mother reading. I had such an appetite for PD James's novels at that time that I did not want to read anyone else. I am still grateful now. I think I am ready for her. She watches with concern as I turn on the tape recorder, explaining that she and machines do not get on. As we sit side by side on the sofa, she is completely engaged: warm, careful and deliberate. She speaks as if she were dictating to a secretary. She turns each answer over, sometimes returning to it for tailoring – to add an extra twist or subtract where necessary – but always determined to do each question justice. Ask PD James: readers' questions Jeffrey Archer Are you a lark or an owl? PD James I am a lark, we get up early in the morning, don't we? I always have woken terribly early. Usually about 5am. I can – and do – work as early as that but then I sleep for an hour in the afternoon. I am a siesta woman. I suppose you could say that, although I am a lark, I go back to the nest again in the afternoon. JA How many rewrites do you do? PDJ This is quite easy to answer: with some passages, absolutely none, whereas with others, I may have to rewrite a considerable number of times before I am satisfied. I know when a thing is not as good as I can make it. That is the point. Other people might be able to do it better but I have to make it the best I can do. And I sometimes feel it is not as good as I can make it. But when it is right you know. It is like with a painting: you know, don't touch it again. Paula Byrne, author of Jane Austen and the Theatre: With which character in Jane Austen do you identify yourself? PDJ It has to be Elizabeth Bennet. I share her humour and irony and interest in other people and her wish to be well married. I have a similar enthusiasm for the security that is offered by family. Because we are always aware in Pride and Prejudice that although Mrs Bennet is, in many ways, a dreadful mum and embarrasses her elder daughters to a terrible extent, she is absolutely right that if Mr Bennet were to have got pneumonia – which they often did, the elderly – and if he had died of it in the winter or had fallen off his horse, the Bennets would have been thrown out of their house by the Collinses and would have had to live in a cottage on the estate. Mrs Bennet was absolutely right about security. I think I should also want the security of a prosperous marriage. Nicci French, crime writer: Do crime novels always have a moral impulse? PDJ No, not the most violent and sadistic of the crime novels but detective stories do affirm the sanctity of each individual life and the possibility of human justice. NF Do you believe in good and evil in a Manichean way or do you see human nature as much more murky and ambiguous? PDJ I believe in good and evil in a Manichean way. Evil is a positive force… to me, this seems close to human experience. NF Are you scared of dying and does that inform your writing? PDJ No, I am not afraid of death but I do fear the process of dying if it means prolonged pain, indignity and lack of independence. I make a strong distinction between death and dying. At over 90, I fear prolonged pain. And as to whether it informs my writing – it probably does but not in a way I am conscious of. Mike Stotter, editor in chief of crime magazine Shots and liaison officer of the Crime Writers' Association: Despite your love of Jane Austen's work, you chose to write in the crime genre. What drew you to the detective story? PDJ I enjoyed reading them from childhood. I thought I could write one successfully and that it would stand a good chance of publication. I love structure in novels and am fascinated by communities of people: a publishing house, a nuclear power station, a theological college. I like studying community life. Ormskirkgirl Why do you think there is a sudden appetite for Nordic crime? And are you a fan? PDJ The stories are strong, the characters believable and the TV series are excellent. And there is a particular attraction to a crime novel set in a different country. O Do you think great thrillers can also qualify as great literature? PDJ Perhaps they can seldom be \"great\" literature but they deserve to be called literature sometimes. And sometimes good literature. Jo Mercer You published your first Dalgliesh in 1962. How has murder changed in half a century? PDJ I doubt whether murder has changed – although the detective novel certainly has. But the common motives of greed, jealousy, anger and hatred have stayed the same. Mark Johnson Have you ever switched your killer halfway through a novel? PDJ No – I plot and plan with great care. Mary Wilkinson What is your hit rate for spotting the killer in the works of other writers? Do you think you might be better than the ordinary reader at literary detection? PDJ As I have been reading crime novels – mostly detective stories – for 80 years, I can spot most of the tricks – particularly those of Agatha Christie. I am also quite likely to hit upon the killer in more modern novels. But spotting the murderer is probably less important in modern detective stories. The pure puzzle – as with Agatha Christie – although ingenious, is probably less important today than the examination of motive, the interest of setting and distinction of writing. The detective novel has moved closer to mainline fiction. Shellshocked Were you annoyed by the Guardian's description of Adam Dalgliesh as \"lugubrious\"? PDJ Not annoyed, as that is obviously how they see him, but I would rather describe him as reticent. Kate Kellaway Is it really true, as I have read somewhere, that your first editor at Faber said he would try and get WH Auden to write a few poems for Dalgliesh for you to slip into your novels? PDJ Yes, though whether Auden would have done it is another matter. It was Charles Monteith who said: \"We'll get Wystan to write some poetry for Dalgliesh.\" KK Wouldn't that have been fantastic – but he died before he got the chance. Might Monteith have persuaded him? PDJ He might, because Auden loved detective stories – he always read my books. Heather87 I am a budding crime writer. What would your main tips for me be? PDJ Increase your word power. Increase your vocabulary. Words are our raw materials. Practise writing. Read widely, particularly of the best writing. Learn to try and understand and sympathise with other people. Go through life always open to experience. Nothing that happens to a writer, good or ill, is ever lost. Hertfordbridge Was Dorothy L Sayers an influence on you? PDJ Yes, I would say that she was. She showed me that crime fiction and good writing are compatible. Although she is, of course, very much of her time and there was a sort of snobbishness that went with those days. Tippisheadrun What would Adam Dalgliesh's reaction to the phone-hacking scandal be and how would Kate Miskin feel (she always seems to be suffering a crisis in confidence about the Met)? PDJ Dalgliesh wouldn't be surprised. He would assume that, unfortunately, this sort of thing has, although he deplores it, probably always gone on. As a private person, he has always hated the lack of privacy in modern life. And Kate would agree with him. Gwyneth Boswell Do you feel that the BBC has become any less like the unwieldy ship you described when you interviewed its DG, Mark Thompson? PDJ I should say that both the chairman of the Trust and the director general are determined on reform but that, largely due to the financial crisis, the waters ahead are bound to be stormy. I should probably also say I am a strong supporter of the BBC. Quelquechose Are you the \"buxom grandmother\" who writes detective fiction in A Taste for Death'? PDJ Now that I am a great grandmother, I am less buxom – or buxom in the wrong places [laughs]. This seems inseparable from old age. Everything falls down. I am like the Queen – the same shape all the way down. You know what I mean. Your bosom goes and your bottom goes. Q For all the influence of Jane Austen on your work, there is a clear stylistic divergence between you when it comes to descriptive density. Did that bother you while writing Death Comes to Pemberley? PDJ We don't get detailed descriptions of the countryside or houses in Jane Austen as we do in my work but because I was trying to write in her style in Death Comes to Pemberley, I had to exercise some discipline. Grazina McCarthy Why is it that most of your stories start in autumn? Do you think the season lends the right atmosphere for murder? PDJ Yes, I agree. Aautumn lends itself to the detective story through the dying light, which is useful in plot making. People can be concealed by darkness and there is a certain melancholy in the dying of the year. Pirkko Mahlamaki What are your views on the right to die with dignity? PDJ I think a person whose life, perhaps through appalling pain, has become intolerable has the right to end it. But I am less assured of the right of other people to indulge in mercy killing. I think murder has to remain the unique crime. And many old people would feel that they ought to end their life perhaps to benefit their children, if the practice were to become commonplace and other elderly people were doing it. Jeanette Winterson What do you love best? PDJ Some people – including members of my family. The security of my home. The English spring. Walking by the sea in Suffolk. [she has a house in Southwold]. And the solace of reading. Peter Lant What is the best thing about being a nonagenarian? PDJ [There is a prolonged silence during which she admits that her silence might serve as an answer in itself.] Oh dear, what can one say for it? One has learnt what is important and what is unimportant. At least, I hope I have learned the difference. I agree with Keats that the most important thing in life is the \"holiness of the heart's affections\". Kate Kellaway Do you feel lucky in the life you have had? PDJ I feel incredibly fortunate and blessed, for which I nightly give thanks. I have worked hard and tried to do my best but many other people do that without the good fortune that I have enjoyed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2011/dec/28/kim-jong-il-funeral-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-28T03:29:00Z","webTitle":"North Korea holds funeral for Kim Jong-il","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/28/kim-jong-il-funeral-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/28/kim-jong-il-funeral-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"North Korea holds funeral for Kim Jong-il","bodyText":"Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Pyongyang to bid farewell to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, in a meticulously choreographed funeral designed to cement his legacy and pave the way for the transfer of power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un. Reports said that the funeral on Wednesday, originally scheduled for mid-morning, had been delayed by several hours after more than 5cm of snow fell in Pyongyang on Tuesday night. The city's citizens had been mobilised to clear snow from the funeral cortege's 40km drive from Kumsusan memorial palace, where Kim's body has been lying in state. The procession was expected to head to the city's main plaza, Kim Il Sung Square, where hundreds of thousands of North Koreans have been paying their respects since hearing of his death 10 days ago. What appeared to be live footage from North Korean state TV showed the procession moving slowly through the streets against a backdrop of snowfall and clearly audible mass outpouring of grief from an estimated 200,000 mourners, most of whom were in military uniform. The procession may have helped answer key questions about the communist regime's immediate future, amid fears that the rapid rise to power of the inexperienced Kim Jong-un could spark a power struggle that could potentially threaten regional security. Jong-un, wearing a long black coat, walked at the front of the hearse carrying his father's casket on its roof, a sign that the succession is proceeding as the older Kim had envisaged when he unveiled the youngest of his three sons as his heir at a military parade in the capital in October 2010. The younger Kim bowed his head slightly and held a military salute as the motorcade left the city's main square. Just yards behind him was his Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law, Jang Song -thaek, whom many expect to help the new leader tighten his grip on power in the coming months. With them was Ri Yong-ho, the army's chief of staff. In front were cars carrying a large wreath draped with black ribbons and a huge portrait of a smiling Kim Jong-il dressed in his trademark khaki suit. Following them were about a dozen black Mercedes-Benz sedans and a larger fleet of white luxury cars. The only military vehicles on display were the jeeps surrounding Kim's hearse. Kim's two other sons, Kim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Chol, have not yet been seen. The early stages of the procession were watched by ranks of soldiers, some of whom held on to each other for support, while women in civilian clothes clasped white handkerchiefs to their mouths. The funeral was accompanied by a slow march performed by a military band and an oscillating commentary from a newscaster identified as Ri Chun-hee, who announced Kim Jong-il's death last week. Amid eulogies to Kim Jong-il, she says that under Jong-un's leadership, \"North Korea will experience only victories\". Some in the crowd could be heard shouting: \"How could you leave us? What are we supposed to do without you?\" State media used the snowy weather to bolster myths about Kim Jong-il's birth on Korea's highest peak, although Soviet records show he was born in Russia. \"The feathery snowfall reminds the Korean people of the snowy day when the leader was born in the secret camp of Mt Paektu and of the great revolutionary career that he followed through snowdrifts,\" said the Korea Central News Agency. \"It seems the sky knows well of how much he got snowed on during his uninterrupted field guidance tour for the happiness of the people.\" Citing the snowy weather, one soldier told North Korea state TV: \"A national tragedy has occurred; how could the sky not cry? Another said: \"The people, the mountains, the streams and the heavens are weeping tears of blood for having to bid the final farewell.\" State media have sought to burnish Kim Jong-il's reputation as an inspired military leader who brought prosperity and progress to what, by any measure, is one of the world's poorest countries. Kim Jong-il, who died from a heart attack on 17 December aged 69, left behind a country that is some way towards developing nuclear weapons as part of his \"military first\" policy.

Large portraits of a smiling Kim Jong-il could be seen around Pyongyang, reports said, with the streets bedecked with red \"kimjongilia\" begonias named after the deceased leader. In the 10 days since Kim Jong-il's death was announced, North Korean state TV has repeatedly broadcast scenes of uniformed soldiers and civilians in black suits or traditional dress falling to their knees in distress before the bier where the \"dear leader\" has been lying in state. In a startling break with tradition, his son was shown in obvious distress as he wiped away tears during one of a reported five visits he has made the mausoleum in just over a week. It was not immediate clear if Kim Jong-il would be buried or embalmed and placed on permanent display next to the body of his father at Kumsusan memorial palace in Pyongyang. The funeral proceedings are expected to last two days. On Thursday, a national memorial service will feature an artillery salute to be followed by a three minutes' silence at noon and trains and ships sounding their horns in unison."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/mar/02/energy-renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-02T15:21:00Z","webTitle":"Live web chat: David MacKay, energy expert and government science adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/mar/02/energy-renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/mar/02/energy-renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Live web chat: David MacKay, energy expert and government science adviser","bodyText":"On Thursday at 1pm, we're joined for a live web chat with energy guru, Cambridge physicist and the department of energy and climate change's chief scientific adviser, David MacKay. Please post your questions for him below. MacKay is perhaps best known as the author of the book Sustainable energy - without the hot air, which is available for free online and has a cult following, not least on our comment threads. Leo Hickman touched on its appeal in 2009, when interviewing Mackay: The book's masterstroke is to express all forms of power consumption and production - the car, the washing machine, the wind turbine, the mobile phone charger, the nuclear power station - in a single unit of measurement. So rather than drown readers in a swamp of gigahertz, megawatts, joules, tonnes of oil equivalent and the like, he describes everything in terms of kilowatt hours per day (kWh/d). Put another way, one 40 watt lightbulb, kept switched on all the time, uses one kilowatt-hour a day. Once we learn that driving the average car 50km a day consumes 40kWh/d, we can see that this is equal to the power needed to keep 40 40W lightbulbs constantly lit for a day. This, MacKay argues, sharpens the debate by helping us to focus on the big things - such as how hopelessly undercooked our current plans for renewable energy are - rather than get distracted by \"eco-gestures\", such as believing you have done your bit by remembering to switch off the mobile phone charger. (\"The amount of energy saved by switching off the phone charger is exactly the same as the energy used by driving an average car for one second.\") This Cambridge University video from 2009 gives a good taste of MacKay's desire for an informed debate on saving energy: MacKay joins us just days after the boss of National Grid, Steve Holliday, called 2011 a 'pivotal' year if the UK is to meet its future targets for cutting carbon emissions. The government's electricity market reform, currently underway, will help influence just what mix of coal, gas, nuclear, wind and other forms of energy keep our lights on in the future. Please post your questions below and check back 1-2pm on Thursday to read MacKay's answers. Any comments not about energy will be marked off-topic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/uk-business-emissions-reduction-recession","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-04T12:16:44Z","webTitle":"Significant reduction in UK emissions attributed to recession","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/uk-business-emissions-reduction-recession","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/uk-business-emissions-reduction-recession","fields":{"headline":"Significant reduction in UK emissions attributed to recession","bodyText":"Source story: GreenWise Synopsis: Government figures reveal that UK GHG emissions decreased 8.7% year-on-year in 2009, after contracting just 1.9% in the previous year. In 2009, the biggest reductions were recorded in the industry, business and energy supply sectors. DECC attributes the overall reduction to lower demand for energy under recessionary conditions and an increased reliance on nuclear power. At current levels, the UK is on course to meet its first legally-binding 'carbon budget' target in 2012: cutting overall emissions by 23% against a 1990 baseline. GSBi Viewpoint: The business sector - a spotlight for targets and regulation, focused currently around the Carbon Reduction Commitment - accounted for 15% of overall GHG emissions in 2009. In real terms, businesses emitted 12% fewer GHGs than in 2008 (and 24% less than in 1990). By contrast, residential emissions in 2009 were only 3% lower than in 1990, although current consumer- focused energy initiatives may drive relative improvements in residential emissions in the future. In the transport sector (22% of total GHG emissions in 2009), emissions have hardly decreased since 1990. As a major end-user of transport, business could play a key role in driving progress. A limitation of the DECC figures is that they are production-based. But a proposed change from later this year would see Defra and DECC publishing consumption-based accounts alongside existing statistics. This would provide a more complete, and possibly quite different, picture. For example, the business sector's emissions profile might change considerably when global supply chains are accounted for. Regardless, the key message to UK companies is not to become complacent about recent advances: a more concerted push is required - by businesses and also across all sectors of the economy - to secure the UK's transition to a low-carbon future.

The fear is that fires in the zone could release clouds of radioactive particles that are, at the moment, locked up in trees, held mainly in the needles and bark of Scots pines. The consortium says an automated fire detection and monitoring system and new firefighting and forestry equipment are needed to guarantee safe management of Chernobyl's forests. Since 1992, six years after the nuclear accident at the Ukrainian power plant which released large quantities of radioactive contamination into the atmosphere, there have been more than 1,000 wildfires inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone (CEZ), the 18-mile radius ring around the plant where access restrictions apply. If there is a catastrophic or \"crown\" fire (a high-intensity wildfire affecting a large part of the CEZ) radionuclides could be dispersed over a wide area; a big fire could send radioactivity as far as Britain. A £3.98m plan for \"basic emergency measures\" has been approved by scientists from the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine, Yale University and the UN Global Fire Monitoring Centre. The Ukrainian government has not fully endorsed the proposal but if it is adopted it could need at least £4.29m more in international funding and technical support, say the scientists. Firefighters tackling woodland fires near Chernobyl lack monitoring as well as equipment. Jakov Kalynik, a firefighter at Parishev station, about nine miles from the ruined plant, said: \"I know when I am fighting a fire on radioactively contaminated ground – you get the heat just like an ordinary fire, but you get a tingling sensation too, like pins jumping all over your body. I don't know how bad it is for me, there's no medical testing afterwards, we just go and wash.\" In March, Chernobyl Forestry Enterprise, a state forestry firm, was \"low on fuel\" and firefighters had to resort to using a horse and cart to fetch water. \"Some equipment, like caterpillar trucks, just sits here,\" said Pyotr Kova, deputy head of Lubyanka fire station district. Dmytro Melnychuk, rector of the national university, said: \"Strontium-90, plutonium, and americium-241 are all extremely susceptible to upward atmospheric migration and dispersal via heat from fires. They create problems for firefighters and others who breathe them in. Radioactive smoke landing on crops … even 150km or more from the fire can create such concentrations of radiation in food it will be harmful to eat. Our studies, together with Yale University, have shown it is imperative we take measures to control the radiation [in] Chernobyl's forests.\" Forest accounts for about 60% of the CEZ's 260,000 hectares (642,200 acres). The plantations soak up radiation and prevent its spread to groundwater. Sergiy Zibtsev, associate professor at the Kiev Institute of Forestry and Landscape Park Management, said: \"Smoke from fires in 2003 … at the former nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk [Kazakhstan] was detected as far off as Canada, so the potential for wildfires to spread radioactivity from Chernobyl is a problem the international community has to take seriously.\" Chernobyl's current firefighting protection system includes watchtower lookouts triangulating wildfires sites by radio. \"The system is effective but very slow,\" said Boris Danilenko, head of Chernobyl Forestry Enterprise. \"By the time a wildfire is big enough to see through summer heat haze it is typically half an acre in size.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/jul/15/high-carbon-bubble","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-15T17:11:00Z","webTitle":"Why a high-carbon investment bubble could be the lesser of evils | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/15/high-carbon-bubble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/15/high-carbon-bubble","fields":{"headline":"Why a high-carbon investment bubble could be the lesser of evils","bodyText":"This week has seen a new green meme emerge: the idea that investment in high-carbon companies is creating a \"carbon bubble\" that could leave the world exposed to another financial crash. The catalyst is a fascinating report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative that explores the obvious but usually overlooked mismatch between the world's stated climate change targets and the market response – or lack thereof. We've known for a long time that the world's remaining carbon budget is tiny compared with the total amount of exploitable oil, coal and gas reserves. In other words, our chance of tackling climate change mainly comes down to one thing: how much fossil fuel the world can be persuaded to leave in the ground. Although that sounds obvious, it's worth restating, because for all the crucial current debate over renewable energy and nuclear power, it's important to bear in mind that low-carbon technologies are necessary but not necessarily sufficient. Even if we had enough low-carbon power to match current energy consumption that wouldn't in itself mean that the fossil fuels would stay in the ground; the world might simply use more energy. Given that meeting the world's agree climate target ‑ limiting global warming to 2C - will almost certainly require huge quantities of valuable fossil fuels to be left untouched, it's surprising that the environment community hasn't been quicker to flag up what that might mean in terms of business risk for fossil fuel companies. If most oil, coal and gas reserves are \"unburnable\", could the primary assets of the world's biggest energy companies be as toxic as the dodgy mortgage debts being traded in the run-up to the 2008 financial collapse? Thanks to the Carbon Bubble report, we now have some better numbers to help us grapple with that question. Based on research by the Potsdam Institute , the report suggests that if the world wants an 80% chance of staying within the 2C limit, we should avoid emitting more than 565 gigatonnes (GT) of CO2 by 2050. That equates to just one-fifth of the world's total proven fossil fuel reserves, which contain enough carbon to produce a massive 2,795GT of CO2, the report estimates. Of course, a large proportion of the world's fossil fuels are controlled by state-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco. But even if these states could somehow be persuaded to leave all their oil, coal and gas in the ground for the greater good, that wouldn't solve the problem because, according to the report, even just the top couple of hundred private energy companies listed on world's stock markets have significantly more carbon assets that the world can afford to burn. And yet fossil fuel companies - which are heavily invested in by our pension funds, as well as by private investors - are generally considered among the safest companies to put money into. So what's going on here? It seems there are four scenarios that could explain the apparent mismatch: 1. The markets are in fact working properly and the cost of energy investments already reflect the considerable risks of unburnable assets. However, this doesn't seem likely given that until the Carbon Bubble report came out there wasn't even an easily available reference with which to compare the carbon content of reserves with the acceptable carbon budget. More fundamentally, it doesn't seem likely when you consider that the big energy companies are openly prospecting for new reserves: if they and their investors really believed they were going to have to leave some of their existing fuels in the earth, why would they be spending large sums of money looking for new ones? (The most recent BP annual report is typical of the industry's public stance on this question: it softly acknowledges that carbon regulation could increase costs and reduce growth opportunities but also states emphatically that \"BP's future hydrocarbon production depends on our ability to renew and reposition our portfolio\".) 2. The markets understand the big-picture risks of unburnable assets but believe these will be obviated by the development of technologies that allow us to inexpensively capture the CO2 released by fossil fuels - either at the point of use or through a massive rollout of ambient carbon scrubbers. This seems unlikely, given carbon capture's painfully slow development. 3. The market is acting irrationally or on bad information and, as the report suggests, gradually inflating a carbon bubble. 4. Conversely, the market believes simply that the risks of unburnable carbon are small because the world shows no sign of taking the two-degrees target seriously. The really worrying thing, I think, is that the fourth scenario seems just as plausible as the third - and will remain so until the UN process shows some progress on legally binding emissions cuts at the global level. In other words, let's hope that there does indeed turn out to be a carbon bubble, because at least a bubble can burst. The alternative - that the markets are correctly predicting there will never be enough political will to impose the2C temperature limit - is the really scary prospect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2012/may/30/queen-elizabeth-how-age-remembered","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-30T16:32:00Z","webTitle":"Queen Elizabeth II: how will our age be remembered?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/30/queen-elizabeth-how-age-remembered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2012/may/30/queen-elizabeth-how-age-remembered","fields":{"headline":"Queen Elizabeth II: how will our age be remembered?","bodyText":"\"Troop after troop – one brilliant colour after another … The Queen smiled and nodded her poor tired head.\" So the 15-year-old Virginia Woolf recorded in her diary the sight of Queen Victoria on the day of her Diamond Jubilee in June 1897. Then all London came out to honour Britain's longest-serving sovereign. The march past and open-air ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral marked the century's high-point of imperial bombast, Victorian self-regard and British self-belief. It was desperately appropriate that the young Virginia Woolf had stood among the crowds. It would be her generation, and fellow Bloomsbury Group intellectuals Lytton Strachey and EM Forster, who would do so much to rubbish the 19th century in the public mind. All too often when we think of the Victorian era it still remains that Bloomsbury caricature of hypocrisy, prudery, mill owners and Methodism. But if we know who the \"Eminent Victorians\" are and what they stand for, what about the Elizabethan era and our own \"Eminent Elizabethans\"? As yet, we stand too close to an era that has not concluded. Nonetheless, this weekend's epic Jubilee celebrations offer a moment of crystalline, national reflection. It is first worth recalling the metaphysical aspirations invested in the young, beautiful sovereign for postwar Britain. Proclaimed Queen Elizabeth II in February 1952, she swore the oath in June 1953. By happy coincidence, and some deft media management, news of Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay's ascent of Mount Everest was announced on the day of the coronation service. \"Be Proud of Britain on This Day,\" ran the Daily Express headline. \"The coronation was like a phoenix-time,\" recalled Princess Margaret of the postwar moment. \"Everything was being raised from the ashes … and nothing to stop anything getting better and better.\" The trope of the times was clear: the young Queen offered Britain (but, first and foremost, England) another go at Gloriana. \"It is our hope that Her Majesty may live long and happily and that her reign may be as glorious as that of her great predecessor, Queen Elizabeth I,\" announced Clement Attlee on behalf of the Labour party. \"Let us hope we are witnessing the beginning of a new Elizabethan age no less renowned than the first.\" But how was this new Elizabethan era to realise itself? In the House of Commons, Tory MP Bernard Braine thought \"the old Elizabethan age great precisely because the spirit of adventure led great men in little ships to sail into the unknown\". That vision now had to be revived among the \"simple, backward, unsophisticated peoples\" of the British dependencies. Even if India, Burma, Ceylon and Palestine had gone, clearly empire would still prove fundamental to the modern Elizabethan age. In fact, the pull of history was all the other way. The 1956 Suez crisis revealed, with humiliating clarity, the limited postwar geopolitical capacity of the United Kingdom, and the slow descent of imperial Britain became inevitable. As decolonisation ground on, culminating in the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, the tides of empire came back to these shores. The modern Elizabethan era will be remembered for the ethnic, racial and religious transformation of Britain. Of course, there was a long history of non-white communities in the UK, but nothing equals the scale and impact of postwar mass migration. Enoch Powell's warnings of \"rivers of blood\" and the impact of multiculturalism makes him a defining figure of the age – even if the last 50 years have disproved his terrifying prophecies of ethnic strife. For the most part, the real story is one of remarkable racial integration, with 9% of UK children now of \"mixed or multiple heritage\", making the likes of Shirley Bassey and Freddie Mercury equally powerful testaments to the Elizabethan era. If we had lost an empire, then we had also famously failed to find a role. Central to that postwar strategic confusion was the spectre of Europe. For all Winston Churchill's happy conception of a Britain able to manage multiple loyalties of Atlanticism, Commonwealth and empire, Queen Elizabeth presided over an epic identity crisis that has still to be resolved. Referendums, parliamentary votes and political parties have all failed to answer the question as to whether our national destiny lies in an integrated Europe or not. And one could pick out any number of late 20th-century statesmen to make the point. However, perhaps Tony Benn is the Elizabethan who most obviously embodies the contradictions. From having been a passionate supporter of Europe, he campaigned against entry in the 1975 referendum and attacked the Common Market for decisions that would \"make the United Kingdom into one province of a western-European state\". The allure of Britain being a global player, head of the Commonwealth and implicit leader of the English-speaking peoples was hard to shake off. The most high-profile victim of our Euro-obsession was, of course, Margaret Thatcher. She too tried to play the role of Gloriana and, inevitably, did not always see eye to eye with Queen Elizabeth II as the impact of monetarism took its toll on Britain's social fabric. Thatcher's place in history lies with a disputed political and economic legacy, but as the first female prime minister in British history she elucidates a broader truth about the Elizabethan age. \"Women can – and must – play a leading part in the creation of a glorious Elizabethan era,\" Thatcher wrote as a young woman in an article for the Sunday Graphic on the eve of coronation. \"Should a woman arise equal to the task, I say let her have an equal chance with the men for the leading Cabinet posts. Why not a woman chancellor – or a woman foreign secretary?\" But the real women's revolution of the Elizabethan age was taking place elsewhere as birth control, abortion reform, and the 1970 Equal Pay Act transformed the gender settlement of the 1950s. One could point to Germaine Greer, Iris Murdoch, Vanessa Redgrave or JK Rowling as eminent Elizabethans in their own right and as part of a broader shift in female equality. The liberalism of the Elizabethan era continued with a legally driven transformation of rights for gay and lesbian people. The 1967 Sexual Offences Act, decriminalising homosexual acts between men, was followed by reforms to the age of consent and the 2004 Civil Partnership Act. Social opinion followed the law as a steady process of acceptance and tolerance transformed the life experiences of millions. However, social liberalism had its price as family breakdown – not least within the House of Windsor – reshaped the societal foundations of Elizabethan Britain. Divorce, cohabitation, and single-parent households all sky-rocketed as the traditional, postwar family structure – on which the welfare state was erected – came under unprecedented pressure. Such flux was a part of the broader Elizabethan tale of social mobility. Even if structural economic inequalities proved resistant to change, the prewar age of deference and hierarchy would end under Elizabeth. The opening up of schooling, universities and the professions – the world of the 1963 Robbins Report, Richard Hoggart and Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim – and the rise of mass culture eroded class divisions and unleashed a surge of creativity. From music to literature to television to film to radio to fine art to poetry, from the Beatles to Salman Rushdie to Cilla Black to Ken Russell to Alastair Cook to Francis Bacon to Philip Larkin, Britain under Elizabeth II repaid the cultural hopes of her coronation. Again, this renaissance has had its price. What the postwar years also wrought was a collapse in regional identities, working-class culture and Protestant sensibility. The demolition of Manchester Union Chapel in 1950, once known as \"the nonconformist cathedral of Lancashire\", signalled the start of the effective demise of nonconformity in British public life. The decline of trade union membership, the loss of dominant local employers, and the modernist destruction of Victorian urban environments undermined provincial culture and (aided by the BBC and globalised media) homogenised British identity. The Guardian stopped being the Manchester Guardian in 1959. And yet the irony was that during Queen Elizabeth's reign, Britishness also subsided as a default form of national identity. The natural, instinctive, 1950s sense of British nationhood – forged through two world wars, a Protestant faith and an imperial project that elided any sense of internal UK differentiation – had come to an end by the early 2000s. For many urban communities in Birmingham, Leicester or Glasgow, being British would be one part of a hyphenated identity which might include Pakistan or Jamaica. For the white British of Glamorgan, Hampshire or Dundee, it could well be that being Welsh, English or Scottish overrode a federal, British affiliation. Despite all the Windsor monarchy's attempts at harmonious British iconography, the leeks and thistles and roses woven into wedding dresses, the allure of an ethnic nationhood trumped the rational architecture of the United Kingdom. Scottish and Welsh nationalist MPs Margaret Ewing and Gwynfor Evans are the real representatives of this age. Underscoring the demise of Britishness was the relative decline of the UK economy. \"There is a lot of talk about the new Elizabethan age but whether it will be implemented will depend on all ranks in industry,\" Brigadier Ralph Rayner told parliament in 1952. \"The British industrialist and merchant, if given half a chance, will wipe the floor with any other industrialist in the world. The British working man, if given a good lead, will certainly beat any other working man in the world.\" Such chauvinism would prove horribly ill-placed as British business failed repeatedly to invest in plant, innovate or market at the same rate as their American, Japanese or European competitors. Moderate trade union leaders such as Jack Jones and Joe Gormley were pushed aside by militant activists determined to bring down capital. And so the \"never had it so good\" coronation boom years of full employment, high growth and low inflation could not be sustained – even as succeeding governments racked up spending commitments based on unachievable growth levels. British industry, management and labour relations proved increasingly uncompetitive on a global stage. But rather than reform our industrial base, the monetarist experiment of Mrs Thatcher decimated our engineering supply chain and unleashed the imbalanced financial services boom of the 1980s. Even the entrepreneurial heroes of the hour – Richard Branson and Alan Sugar – could not hide the structural failings at the core of a weakening British economy. What did remain true to the New Elizabethan ethos was British scientific excellence. \"From the start, the royal couple were directly associated with modern technology,\" writes the historian Richard Weight. Queen Elizabeth was the first British monarch to arrive in her capital by aeroplane and the Duke of Edinburgh imagined himself as something of a Prince Albert touring research facilities and university campuses. James Watson, Francis Crick and Rosamund Franklin's discovery of DNA in 1953 added to the sense of possibilities and, since then, successful UK science has proved an elemental companion to the Elizabethan era. Christopher Hinton's work on civil nuclear power, Brian Josephson's achievements on superconductivity, Bob Edwards's IVF revolution, and Tim Berners-Lee's contribution to the world wide web can stand tall with anything the Victorians have had to offer. And what of politics? As with Queen Victoria, the reign is too long to quantify. The 1850s ideologies of laissez-faire, free trade and a nightwatchman state appear an aeon away from the interventionist New Liberalism and municipal socialism of the 1890s. Similarly, the \"Butskellism\" and corporatism of Queen Elizabeth's postwar years belongs to another civilisation in comparison with the globalised neo-liberalism of the late 20th century. The modern Elizabethan era encompasses both Keynesianism and monetarism; both warfare economies and welfare states; two-party, Westminster politics and devolved, nationalist assemblies. The titans are obvious – Harold MacMillan, Roy Jenkins, Barbara Castle, Nye Bevan, Nigel Lawson – and the trends apparent, with the central state (in historical terms) assuming ever-greater power and responsibilities over British life. Longevity, educational provision, cultural opportunities and lifestyle choices are opened up on an unprecedented basis. But what are the axes of political change in the Elizabethan era? I would offer the death of Churchill in 1965 (and the requiem for Britain as a great power); the election of Thatcher in 1979 (and the end of the postwar consensus); and the victory of Tony Blair in 1997 (and a new conception of a globalised Britain). Few other western-European nations have been able to cope with the kind of economic and political stresses the past half-century has brought without damaging state instability. The multiple republics of France, the dictatorships of Spain and Greece, the relentless democratic crises of Italy stand in contrast to the relative ease of rule by Queen Elizabeth II. Of course, it is all pomp and no power these days and the House of Windsor has become ever more adept at the flummery of monarchy. But it does the left no favours to dismiss the stability and affection in which the Queen is held as a simple display of false consciousness. Her reign has encompassed the demise of Britain as a great global power, the transformation of culture and class, the lobotomy of the British economy, the end of deference and a distinctive sense of Britishness, and yet has also maintained a strong sense of national pride and self-belief in which she herself is bound up. No doubt this weekend, along the Thames tow-path, watching the Gloriana, Havengore and Spirit of Chartwell make their way down river, a modern Virginia Woolf will stand ready to let rip at the failings of her forefathers. But history shows she would best define it before the courtiers do. What defines the Second Elizabethan era for you? Tell us about the events, objects, buildings, works of art and literature, the moments big and small that have shaped our age. • This article was amended on 1 June 2012 to change the phrase 'homosexuals and lesbians' to read 'gay and lesbian people', in accordance with our style guide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/apr/09/david-cameron-tory-green-measures","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-09T14:07:20Z","webTitle":"Has David Cameron gone soft on the Tories' 'tough' green measures? | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/apr/09/david-cameron-tory-green-measures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/apr/09/david-cameron-tory-green-measures","fields":{"headline":"Has David Cameron gone soft on the Tories' 'tough' green measures?","bodyText":"Is David Cameron really up to speed on the Conservative party's green policies, which in places are very impressive? That's the question in my mind, following the first outing of green issues in the general election campaign. It came during an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, in which Evan Davies asked Cameron whether his early husky-hugging zeal for greenery had simply been part of decontaminating the Tory brand, given his lack of engagement on the issues since. (Listen to the Today interview here, from 14 minutes onward) Cameron roundly rejected that charge, and only slightly over-egged his party's important role in delivering the world-first Climate Change Act, committing the UK to an 80% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Friends of the Earth's Martyn Williams, who drafted the first climate change bill before Cameron was even leader, says: \"It is true that David Cameron's support played a huge part in getting the bill introduced.\" But then Davies quoted a speech Cameron made early in his career as leader, asking what \"tough measures\" he would take on climate change and the environment. The \"green deal\", replied Cameron, grants to improve the woeful energy efficiency of the nation's draughty homes. That's just common sense - it cuts energy bills and pays for itself quickly - pointed out Davies. Try again, he said. And here's the rub. Did Cameron mention the Conservative opposition to a third runway at Heathrow, hated by greens but backed by Labour? Did he mention the Tory's ambitious nuclear plans? The near victory in parliament on introducing emissions limits for power stations? No, none of the above. Instead he offered support for air passenger duty increases and twice mentioned not stopping rises in landfill tax. The UK is the landfill king of Europe, mainly because of our aversion to incineration, and cutting the amount of our rubbish we simply bury is a good idea. But it's far from a tough, game-changing vision on environment the Tory's green statements promise. So did Cameron judge that runways, nuclear power and, say, wind turbines, were just too controversial to be discussed? Or did these policies just not come to mind? I'd guess the latter, which if true, suggests Cameron's commitment to the environmental agenda is not as deep as he has led us to believe. The environment will get its day in the sun before polling day (and the Tories will face tougher interviews). I look forward to seeing what that bright light reveals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/mar/28/former-equity-derivatives-structurer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Former equity derivatives structurer: 'The key is values' | Joris Luyendijk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/28/former-equity-derivatives-structurer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/28/former-equity-derivatives-structurer","fields":{"headline":"Former equity derivatives structurer: 'The key is values'","bodyText":"We are meeting for a sustainably sourced sandwich in the City, one sunny, spring day in March.

He designed what are known as \"structured equity products\" for a major bank until recently. \"Short-termism is the big problem in finance. Imagine you're running a marathon, 42km, but your performance is evaluated every 100m. This is life for many asset managers at pension funds, the people deciding where our pension money gets invested.

Used sensibly you can do useful things with it. Used for aggressive purposes, it becomes a weapon of mass destruction. \"I loved doing what I did. In the end I left for two reasons. One was internal politics – I was tired of fighting colleagues sitting next to me who were trying to steal the business I originated. The other was personal values – I felt just making large returns for your shareholders was not all there was to life. \"One of the problems with management in the financial markets arm of investment banks is that people are promoted for reasons that have nothing to do with their management skills. If you are a successful trader, and you become a managing director, suddenly you have a team of people assigned to you. Traders are relatively introverted individuals, and now they have to manage a group of individuals? \"Fighting colleagues … how that would work. I would find a client in the UK who is having a tax problem with a portfolio of French shares. So the deal originates with my relationship with this UK client. But since these are French shares, I have to bring in the French specialist, and suddenly he says: 'I have to be in the lead on this deal!' \"Since the product I am putting together touches on tax issues, suddenly my tax specialist colleague claims this is all his territory and the deal belongs to him. \"However, half the people there I'm still in touch with. They were a decent bunch. Basically you had this brotherhood of geeks; people with such levels of expertise that they didn't need to be so ruthless. If you are in a niche market, those people were fantastic to work with. \"You might say, the culture in finance is simply how humans behave. It's not exclusive to banking. You might say it's like football, where on one level it's your team against the other team, but each individual player is also competing with the others for a place in his own team. And if you can score yourself, rather than let the other guy take the glory … You see how this works. Falling to the ground to get a penalty kick … Constantly flirting with other teams or agents, even going as far as refusing to play because you want to be bought by an ever better paying club, like Tevez does … Screaming at the referee to put pressure on him … \"Every weekend, millions of people watch football players behave like this, and everybody seems to mind or consider it unacceptable. But think again. Rugby. That's a sport as tough and manly as football. Yet no one really fakes stuff to get his opponent booked, or get a penalty kick. Only the captain talks to the referee. At the same time players get hit much more and much harder than in football. \"I am convinced the key is values. Rugby is governed by different set of values and this translates into a different kind of behaviour. \"How do you create that change in finance? My theory is that we need to focus on the ultimate asset owners. The banks work with money that is, in the end, owned by governments or individuals, who are saving or have paid it into their pension funds. \"Now think of the asset managers at those pension funds. They work for us? Why do they invest in Goldman Sachs? It's us, shareholders through our pension funds, who own huge parts of the investment banks whose behaviour we decry. \"Why don't the asset managers take action? Why don't we take action? Do the owners of Goldman Sachs really want it to change, or do they in turn want to squeeze the maximum out of them? We have to vote with our investments and our consumption habits. \"I have read Greg Smith's resignation letter from the equity derivatives desk at Goldman Sachs. For me, it goes back to the values in an organisation. If you could sell your product for double the price, would you do it? I would say, in business, that's legitimate, provided your clients have adequate information. \"This is an important rule with structured derivatives that clients ignore at their peril. You have got to read the small print. You need to bring in a lawyer who explains it to you before you buy these things – otherwise there is information asymmetry. \"There is a lot of mis-selling, and not just in derivatives. The mortgage brokers in the US who sold low-income people those sub-prime mortgages. Low-income people didn't understand finance, didn't comprehend that interest rates would jump after a short discount period. That's mis-selling. \"If a financial tool is abused and mis-sold, this does not disqualify the tool. \"My job was called structuring. I would put together structured solutions using derivatives for clients. There are mainly four silos of clients in derivatives: the so-called 'institutionals' like pension funds, hedge funds and asset managers – basically people managing other people's money. Or they would be governments, though not specifically equity derivatives. Then there are companies, which we call 'corporates'. Finally there are the so-called 'high net-worth individuals' – really, really rich people. \"A derivative can be really useful. A farmer has no idea of weather conditions in the coming months. There may be a flood, there may be a drought. His harvest may be fantastic, it may all be lost. Say this farmer needs £100,000 to get started for the new season. Getting that money from a bank without any guarantee can be tough. But now the farmer enters into a derivative, where his counter party agrees to buy his harvest for £120,000 for delivery at the end of the season. If the harvest is poor, he'll still get the £120,000, and the deal 'goes against his counter party' as we call it. If the harvest is fantastic and ends up worth more than £120,000, his counter party makes a profit. \"Either way, the farmer has financed his harvest in an efficient way as he's priced in his expenses and a known profit. This is a textbook example of the good use of derivatives. \"But there's another side to this. Derivatives can be complex and relatively costly to implement, so it's often mostly the big players in farming who end up using them. \"Say you are a pension fund and you are worried about the state of the UK economy, and you want to protect yourself against a downturn. Then you can buy a derivative that says: if the FTSE goes below a certain level, you will be paid a certain amount. This would be called a 'put option'. \"Next you have to decide on the duration. You want the protection to last three months, six months … The thing is that in this case a derivative costs a lot of money, the way an insurance premium costs money. \"What I have seen happening is a very big pension fund considered getting protection mid 2007. They waited and waited, the crisis happened and then they were too late. They ended up down 40% on their UK portfolio by 2008. It's all about timing. \"Another sort of derivative solution may involve a company holding a strategic 5% of shares in another company. Now they want to sell that 5% but the share price has gone down, so they want to dispose of it but still partially benefit in the upside over the next few years. I would design a bespoke derivative that met those needs. As I said, I loved doing what I did. It was intellectually very challenging. \"Was this morally ambiguous, helping corporations efficiently organise their taxes through complex financial engineering? The way private equity and hedge fund firms have moved everything offshore and they're paying basically no taxes … That feels more immoral to me. And everybody just accepts this. I'd say that goes much further than corporations using every possibility the law affords them to keep taxes efficient. Again, I don't mean offshoring. That's possibly hiding things. \"You have to realise that all corporations are actively managing their taxes given current regulation and they generally don't do anything illegal. Internal revenue signs off on those deals. My sense is that there are bigger battles out there to fight, than this one, like the way corporations pay their lower-income employees or squeeze their suppliers. These issues are far more important if we want to build a more sustainable economy. \"I used to earn just over £110,000 and then a bonus of two or three times my salary in a good year and between one or 1.5 times in bad years (although our unit was always profitable). By the way, beyond the first £110,000 of a bonus, I would get more than 50% in bank shares, which you could only sell after a few years. So actually they are now worth much less. \"The financial sector has grown so much over the last decades. There are so many more of us now saving up for a pension, in part due to our lack of trust in our governments to pay us a pension to retire on. In the last 30 years there has been a huge demand for sophistication in investments in order to meet that demand. What are all these asset managers at pension funds managing our savings going to do? \"They look for diversified investments. They want assets that are uncorrelated, meaning if one goes down, the others don't automatically go, too. We thought we had this figured out, but the crisis proved us wrong. What happened was that when the 'asset pool of mortgage securities' went down, asset managers had to take money out of good asset pools to compensate for others. As a result these good asset classes went down, too. They were not correlated as assets, but they were through the money supply. \"You have delta-one traders and volatility traders. Delta-one are products that mimic one-for-one an underlying asset, for example the FTSE 100 index. It is easier to buy one simple contract, albeit limited in time, than to buy the basket of all the 100 stocks making up the FTSE 100. Volatility traders trade only one direction of a share or index price (eg the price going up). In fact they end up trading the speed in movement of an underlying, not the share price itself. It's a different world. Volatility traders are in a multidimensional world, and often a very special animal. Lonely, introvert, often prone to substance abuse. They are like those guys in air-traffic control towers. They can hold in their heads a matrix of many variables at the same time, with new information constantly coming in at high speed. \"If you look on a trading floor, you can recognise the cash desks as they have two screens; one to chat with their girlfriend, the other with their outstanding deals. The volatility trader will have eight to 10 screens. \"Then you have flow and structured products. Flow-traders execute simple trades, often listed on an exchange, on behalf of clients, and make their money mainly off commissions like a broker. They deal in the plain vanilla stuff on delta-one or volatility, standardised contracts with small margins that are traded in large volumes. On the other hand, structured products (they are called OTC or 'over-the-counter') are contracts agreed between two parties where the documentation is specifically tailored to the situation. Nowadays, there are standards promoted by ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) used by all parties, which guarantees a common language. • Follow @JLbankingblog on Twitter"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/18/ireland-wind-power-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-18T21:40:42Z","webTitle":"UK urges Ireland to build windfarms on west coast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/18/ireland-wind-power-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/18/ireland-wind-power-grid","fields":{"headline":"UK urges Ireland to build windfarms on west coast","bodyText":"Ireland's unspoiled, windswept west coast could become the focus of a new wave of windfarm construction in the wake of a high-level diplomatic meeting to be held tomorrow in London. UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, Taoiseach Enda Kenny and other senior members of the British-Irish Council will gather to discuss a plan to expand electricity grid connections throughout the British Isles. In particular, they want to build new inter-connectors to link the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain in order to transmit power from new windfarms in Ireland to England. The aim of the plan, created by the British government, is to open up remote regions that could provide Britain with more power generated by windfarms, as well as by tide and wave plants, and so reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. \"The west coast of Ireland has some of the fiercest winds in Europe,\" said Charles Hendry, the UK energy minister, who will be attending the meeting. \"They whip in off the Atlantic which makes it is an ideal location for windfarms. However, the Irish market for electricity is less than a tenth of that of Britain. That means that companies cannot afford to build windfarms in Ireland because there is no market for their power. We want to put that right.\" The construction of windfarms in Ireland that would supply power to neighbouring countries could help to put the UK back on track in its use of clean, renewable energy. Britain has recently been criticised for falling short of its targets for constructing wind power plants and for cutting its carbon emissions. Importing clean power could help to resolve the problem. A link connecting the grids of Ireland and Britain is currently under construction and will stretch from Rush North Beach, Co Fingal, to Barkby Beach, north Wales. The Irish Sea Inter-Connector will cost £500m and have a capacity of 500 megawatts. However, under the scheme to be discussed tomorrow, other new links would also be built. This would open up a market for electricity for windfarms on the west coast of Ireland whose power could be transmitted under the Irish Sea. Developments like these would be controversial, however. Construction of wind turbines generates strong opposition and plans to build clusters in mainland Britain have been greeted with fury. Opponents say wind turbines rarely work to capacity; spoil some of the country's most beautiful landscapes; and kill large numbers of wild birds. Supporters argue that windfarms help to reduce dependence on carbon-emitting fossil-fuel plants and are non-polluting. Nevertheless, the prospect of giant turbines peppering the wild, craggy coasts of the Dingle Peninsula, Kerry and Galway will provoke a furious response. Hendry rejected the idea that the turbines would be controversial in Ireland, however. \"It will be up to the Irish government and the Irish people to decide if they want to build them. This is a voluntary programme and it could bring significant wealth to the country with very little downside.\" The All Islands electricity plan is not confined to Ireland and Britain. The British-Irish Council meeting – which will also be attended by Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, and leaders of local governments in Wales, Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man – will consider a number of proposals to modernise the British Isles' electricity grid network. Some of these focus on existing sources, in particular onshore and offshore wind turbines, while others anticipate the construction of new forms of energy generation such as wave and tidal power. The islands of Islay and Orkney have already been targeted as promising sites for tidal plants. However, all sites suffer from the problem of remoteness, an issue targeted by the plan to be discussed tomorrow. \"Some of the best resources for generating tidal power lie in waters off the Channel Islands,\" said Hendry. \"But as things stand at present, there is no way to get that power to mainland Britain. We need to look at building a new inter-connector with France, taking it from the new nuclear power station currently being built at Flamanville, via the Channel Islands, to the UK. When the tides are right at Jersey and Guernsey, we could take electricity from their wave generators, and when they are not providing power, take it from Flamanville.\" Hendry added that earlier discussions with delegates indicated that the plan would be well received tomorrow. Once the various proposals had been discussed, detailed analysis would be carried out over the next 18 months with the aim of turning them into specific projections that could be launched in 2013."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/16/editorial-japan-disaster-cost-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T00:01:04Z","webTitle":"Japan disaster: the cost of a crisis | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/16/editorial-japan-disaster-cost-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/16/editorial-japan-disaster-cost-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Japan disaster: the cost of a crisis","bodyText":"The FTSE down over 1%. The Dow off 200 points by the afternoon. Oil down. Tokyo shares plunging by more over a two-day period than they did during the crash of 1987. Investors spent yesterday sizing up the damage done to the world economy by Japan's earthquake and tsunami. The truth is that it is still far too early to form even a provisional answer to that question, for the very obvious reason that we still don't know how bad this crisis will get. As the engineers battling to regain control of the Fukushima nuclear plant could tell you, an awful lot remains in the balance. However, there are some key questions emerging. Their answers will partly determine the medium-term economic impact of the tragedy that has befallen Japan. The first is obviously how the crisis develops. Fukushima's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has now admitted that there is a possibility of a partial meltdown, while officials say that is a \"high possibility\". Basic, important information such as the age of the fuel rods inside the plant has still not been disclosed – yet without knowing how new the rods are, the public can have little idea of the possible radioactive threat. As the OECD pointed out yesterday, we know that the four prefectures most affected by the earthquake account for 6% to 7% of Japan's GDP, but the destruction caused is \"so large that it is not possible … to estimate its economic impact\". Without even trying to put numbers on all this, the short-run impact is likely to be sharply deflationary, knocking out energy generation and disrupting the supply of both power and goods. It may well be that Friday's quake has tipped Japan back into recession. The second is how policymakers react. The Bank of Japan has already begun pumping 23 trillion yen (£180bn) into the country's financial system. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, may well also unveil a round of reconstruction spending. After the Kobe earthquake of 1995 the government spent about 5tn yen, or what then amounted to 1% of national income. Until it was overtaken by China a few months ago, Japan was the world's second-largest economy. It remains the source of much investment abroad. With little in the way of natural energy resources, Japan is likely to rely less on nuclear power in the coming months and more on gas and oil imports. That may well keep prices high over the coming weeks, especially if other countries rethink their nuclear plans. These and other consequences will mount up in the next few days and weeks. The true economic impact of Friday's superquake is still to be accounted; what is clear is that it came while the global economic recovery was itself neither broad nor strong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/10/chile-patagonia-dams-hydroelectricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-10T19:38:29Z","webTitle":"Protests after Chile backs giant dams in Patagonia's valleys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/10/chile-patagonia-dams-hydroelectricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/10/chile-patagonia-dams-hydroelectricity","fields":{"headline":"Protests after Chile backs giant dams in Patagonia's valleys","bodyText":"Chilean authorities have approved a £1.8bn plan to dam two rivers in Patagonia for hydroelectricity, triggering angry protests and claims that swathes of pristine wilderness will be destroyed. The HidroAysén project envisages five dams to tap the Baker and Pascua rivers, an isolated area of fjords and valleys, and generate 2.75 gigawatts of power for Chile's booming economy. The government has championed the dams as vital to poverty alleviation and economic growth, but public opinion has split, with many saying the project is unnecessary and will devastate an ecological haven. Police arrested dozens of protesters and clashed with hundreds more in Coihaique, a Patagonian city where on Monday a government-appointed commission voted 11 to one in favour of the dams after a three-year environmental review. The commissioners were kept indoors for their own safety as people threw rocks and battled police with water cannon and tear gas. Similar scenes unfolded in the capital, Santiago. The Patagonia Without Dams advocacy group accused the commissioners of conflicts of interest and said the project was \"destructive and illegal\". It said the dams would flood at least 5,600 hectares of rare forest ecosystems, river valleys and farmland. \"We are outraged. We are calling on President [Sebastián] Piñera to overturn this decision and protect Patagonia,\" said Patricio Rodrigo, the group's executive secretary. Critics say the project would also drown the habitat of the endangered southern huemul deer, a national symbol. An Ipsos poll said 61% of Chileans opposed the dams. The polarisation offered a sharp contrast to the nation's feelgood glow after last year's rescue of 31 trapped miners, an operation which boosted the conservative president's ratings. The environment minister, María Ignacia Benítez, denied the commission's findings were a stitch-up in favour of energy corporations and banks which would profit from the project. The \"very demanding\" investigation adhered to laws and took into account the environmental impact, she told Radio Agricultura. HidroAysén argued that the dams would provide cheap and clean electricity in comparison to oil and coal. Chile recently approved three coal plants, including the biggest one in Latin America. The interior minister, Rodrigo Hinzpeter, told reporters: \"The most important thing is that our country needs to grow, to progress, and for this we need energy.\" Some analysts say Chile will need to triple its energy capacity in the next 15 years to feed fast-growing industries and cities. Though rich in copper and other minerals, the country imports 97% of its fossil fuels and relies mainly on hydropower for electricity, leaving it vulnerable to oil shocks and drought. The council of ministers is expected to nod through the proposed dams but activists hope to win key concessions in the environmental impact assessment for the next phase of the project: 1,200-mile transmission lines, estimated to cost £2.3bn, to bring electricity from Patagonia to Santiago. That review, due in December, could sharply restrict the number of lines or alternatively open Patagonia to multiple lines, roads and possibly more dams. Much of the controversy hinges on whether Chile has viable alternative means to boost power capacity. With nuclear power widely considered anathema, some tout the Atacama desert as a source of immense solar thermal production, especially given its relative proximity to mines and industry. \"Numerous studies have shown that Chile can sustainably and safely meet its energy needs through increased investments in non-conventional renewable energy and energy efficiency, with less environmental, social and economic costs than HidroAysén,\" said Berklee Lowrey-Evans, of the International Rivers group. However Maria Isabel Gonzalez, former head of Chile's National Energy Commission, rebuked foreign critics of the plan. \"Chile is still a poor country, with 2.5 million poor people, and to overcome poverty we need energy, and for that reason we need to develop our own resources,\" she told AP. \"It would be very selfish on the part of the rich countries to say, 'Look how they're destroying these uninhabited pristine areas.' \""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/oct/18/nuclearpower-architecture","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-17T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Letters: Don't dress up nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/18/nuclearpower-architecture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/oct/18/nuclearpower-architecture","fields":{"headline":"Don't dress up nuclear power","bodyText":"Architects should decline to get involved in building nuclear reactors on ethical grounds (Sun, sand - and a nuclear reactor, G2, October 14).

Workers struggling to halt the leaks successfully used a mixture of sawdust, newspaper, concrete and a type of liquid glass to stem the flow of contaminated water near a seaside pit, said the plant's owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco). Earlier efforts involving cement, an absorbent polymer and rags were unsuccessful in plugging the leak, which was discovered on Saturday, while radiation of more than 7.5 million times the legal limit for seawater was found just off the earthquake-hit plant. In a sign of Tepco's desperation, it breached its own regulations on Monday by beginning an intentional discharge of 11,500 tonnes of less contaminated water into the Pacific to make space for the highly radioactive liquid that was seeping out in an uncontrolled manner. The company still needs to pump contaminated water into the sea because of a lack of storage space at the plant and will continue to release the 11,500 tonnes of low-level radioactive water until Friday. \"The leaks were slowed yesterday after we injected a mixture of liquid glass and a hardening agent and it has now stopped,\" a Tepco spokesman told Reuters. A 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami hit Japan's northeast coast on 11 March, leaving 28,000 people dead or missing and thousands homeless. It is the country's worst catastrophe since the second world war. Samples of the water used to cool the plant's reactor No 2 were emitting 5 million times the legal limit of radioactivity, officials said on Tuesday, adding to fears that contaminants had spread far beyond the disaster zone. Workers are still struggling to restart cooling pumps – which recycle the water – in four reactors damaged by the earthquake and tsunami. Until those are fixed, they must pump in water from outside to prevent overheating, and meltdowns. In the process, that creates more contaminated water that has to be pumped out and stored somewhere else or released into the sea. The government is considering restrictions on seafood for the first time after contaminated fish were found. India is the first country to ban food imports from all areas of Japan over radiation fears. Tepco has offered \"condolence money\" to those affected in the Fukushima region, but one city rejected the compensation and local mayors who came to Tokyo to meet the prime minister, Naoto Kan, demanded greater assistance. \"We have borne the risks, co-existed and flourished with Tepco for more than 40 years, and all these years, we have fully trusted the myth that nuclear plants are absolutely safe,\" said Katsuya Endo, the mayor of Tomioka. He was one of eight Fukushima prefecture mayors seeking compensation and support for employment, housing and education for the tens of thousands of evacuees. A total of 60,000 tonnes of highly contaminated water remains in the plant after workers poured in seawater when fuel rods experienced partial meltdown after the earthquake and tsunami hit on March 11."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/25/energetic-approach-green-investment-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-25T00:05:08Z","webTitle":"Letters: More energetic approach needed on green investment bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/25/energetic-approach-green-investment-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/25/energetic-approach-green-investment-bank","fields":{"headline":"More energetic approach needed on green investment bank","bodyText":"If the chancellor wanted to boost growth in the budget he should have given the new green investment bank full borrowing powers now – not in 2015 (Green initiatives, 24 March).

And the green economy should be a big driver for growth, creating jobs and helping deliver the required deficit reduction. The £3bn the chancellor has pledged is a good start, but it won't be enough on its own. The huge levels of investment a fully fledged bank could have leveraged from day one would have brought jobs and growth to many parts of the country at a time when public sector cuts are biting. From investing in new wave and tidal power systems in Cornwall to insulation for homes in Hull – the ability to borrow and lend right now would have created employment all round the UK. It would also have put UK businesses in a prime position to capitalise on the growing worldwide market for clean energy technology that is clearly destined to be huge. Instead of neutering the bank until 2015 the Treasury should work with the Office for National Statistics to maximise the green investment bank's ability to invest, while minimising its impact on the deficit. Joan Walley MP Chair, Environmental audit committee • It was announced last week, after a fast-track review, that the government's feed in tariff will be cut, cutting the incentives to farmers to build solar farms on their land. Tariffs will be cut from 31p per kWh to 8.5p per kWh of energy fed into the grid. This announcement casts doubt on all non-domestic schemes, and while both domestic and commercial schemes are important, if we are to move Britain towards a low-carbon economy, we need to see more commercial photovoltaics schemes. Many different investors have invested in renewables, and solar in particular, solely on the basis that the FiT income is guaranteed for 25 years. This backtrack has halted many important CO2 saving projects and has undermined the low-carbon industry's confidence about investing in the UK. Jon Abbatt Principal consultant, ADAS • Although we are still in the middle of a nuclear catastrophe in Japan, the government sees fit to hand out a major subsidy to the nuclear industry, in the form of carbon-floor pricing. It is estimated that this will benefit them by around £3bn between now and 2050 for doing absolutely nothing. Couldn't the government think of a way to only give the benefit of carbon-floor pricing in proportion to the carbon saved and not to existing, unsustainable and non-renewable sources such as nuclear power.

Braystones and Kirkstanton in Cumbria have already attracted strong local opposition to being nominated by German company RWE Power but have been included alongside existing atomic sites such as Sizewell in Suffolk and Wylfa in Anglesey. The proposals form part of government plans to replace ageing nuclear power stations and highly polluting coal plants in an attempt to beat an energy supply crunch and lower carbon emissions. Members of the public are being given one-month consultation period to express their opinion on a form of energy generation that is back in fashion with politicians after losing public confidence due to accidents such as those at Chernobyl in the Ukraine and Tree Mile Island in America. \"This is another important step towards a new generation of nuclear power stations,\" said energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband. \"I want to listen to what people have to say about these nominations and I encourage people to log on to our website, read the information and let us have their comments. Nuclear power is part of the low-carbon future for Britain.\" The full list of potential locations is: Dungeness in Kent; Sizewell in Suffolk; Hartlepool in Cleveland; Heysham in Lancashire; Sellafield in Cumbria; Braystones in Cumbria; Kirksanton in Cumbria; Wylfa Peninsula in Anglesey; Oldbury in Gloucestershire; Hinkley Point in Somerset and Bradwell in Essex. The sites have been nominated by the energy giants EDF, Eon and RWE, and by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which owns some nuclear sites. None are in Scotland or Northern Ireland. The Nuclear Industries Association, which represents companies in the sector, said publication of a list of potential sites for nuclear development was an important step for new build in Britain. \"The announcement of sites shows that we're making strong and tangible progress towards building new nuclear power stations, which will help keep the UK's lights on and drive down our carbon emissions,\" said Keith Parker, chief executive of the NIA. Local authority leaders also welcomed the move. Isle of Anglesey council leader Phil Fowlie said the announcement was \"very good news\" for the local economy, pointing out that 1,000 people are employed at the existing Wylfa power station or at related businesses nearby. \"In these economic times it is so, so important for us to secure the future of nuclear power in Anglesey. In the short term, it will create thousands of construction jobs as the new power station is built and in the long term it will secure work for those already employed at Wylfa and nearby,\" said Fowlie. But anti-nuclear campaigners made clear they would fight hard to prevent any new power stations being built. \"The government is going down the wrong path in proposing that we should have more nuclear power stations,\" said Charles Barnett, chairman of the Shutdown Sizewell Campaign in Suffolk. \"They are not safe. With the heightened risk of terrorism, it's foolhardy to build more. They are very expensive and they leave a legacy of dangerous waste. We shall be resisting the plans. The way forward is benign energy forms – wind, waves, solar and biomass.\" Martin Forwood, campaign co-ordinator for Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (CORE), said any new nuclear installations would be disastrous for Cumbria. \"If the government was to get the go-ahead, I think it would be the kiss of death for any chance for Cumbria to diversify its economy away from its dependence on the nuclear industry, something it has been dominated by for the last 50 years. It will seal its fate. It would become the Lake District Nuclear Park and sit very uncomfortably alongside the Lake District National Park. It doesn't need to become a nuclear park, West Cumbria has so much more to offer.\" Friends of the Earth's energy campaigner, Robin Webster, said \"breathing new life into the failed nuclear experiment\" was not the answer to the UK's energy problems. She added: \"Nuclear power leaves a deadly legacy of radioactive waste that remains highly dangerous for tens of thousands of years and costs tens of billions of pounds to manage. \"And building new reactors would divert precious resources from developing safe, clean renewable power: nuclear firms are already lobbying ministers to water down UK renewable energy targets.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jan/11/nuclear-power-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-11T11:43:45Z","webTitle":"Nuclear radiation risk: The current consensus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/11/nuclear-power-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jan/11/nuclear-power-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear radiation risk: The current consensus","bodyText":"How is radiation harmful? Ionising radiation, which includes the type emitted in nuclear power plants and in radiotherapy or medical diagnostics, can damage the DNA in the nucleus of a cell. Unless the cell's repair machinery can fix the breaks, or else the cell itself is killed, it has a higher chance of becoming cancerous. What is a safe dose? A single dose below 100 millisieverts (mSv) is usually considered safe and a CT scan exposes a patient to about 5 mSv. Background radiation in the environment depends on where you live but, on average, it is the equivalent of around 0.2 mSv a month. Environmental regulations recommend a person's annual dose to remain in line with background, which comes to around 2.5 mSv a year. Is there a threshold below which radiation does no damage? The levels of safe radiation are calculated by extrapolating backwards from observations of damage to cells at high radiation doses. Much of that comes from survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. No one is certain whether the extrapolations about low doses are correct but the scientific consensus is that the relationship between dose and damage is linear and that there is no dosage that doesn't have a risk of causing lasting damage, even if the risk is tiny. Wade Allison, professor of physics at Oxford University, disputes this, arguing that there is a threshold of about 200 mSv, below which the body can repair all DNA damage caused and, therefore, which is safe. Does public fear of radiation make nuclear power more expensive? Allison argues that because of his safe threshold, the regulations set up to prevent people being exposed to low doses of radiation are unnecessary and make nuclear power more expensive. These rules all require large amounts of shielding for the nuclear reactor, push up the price of waste disposal and place limits on how long technicians can work in certain high-risk areas. Revising some of these regulations, says Allison, might bring down the costs of nuclear power and make it an even more economical way to tackle climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/09/energy-policy-nuclear-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-09T17:01:00Z","webTitle":"Miliband paves way for most ambitious fleet of new nuclear reactors in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/09/energy-policy-nuclear-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/09/energy-policy-nuclear-coal","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband paves way for most ambitious fleet of nuclear reactors in Europe","bodyText":"A new fleet of nuclear power stations was today backed by the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, as he outlined the UK government's plans to fast-track major energy infrastructure projects, also including \"clean coal\" power stations and windfarms. Six draft \"national policy statements\" would secure the UK's energy supply as ageing plants close, reduce carbon emissions in generating power and create jobs, he said. He also called for an overhaul of the planning system to encourage new low-carbon energy developments. A programme of up to four commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstrations, including both pre-combustion and post-combustion capture technologies, will be funded by a new CCS Incentive. However, Miliband admitted that only two of the demonstration projects - those from Scottish Power and E.ON - are currently proceeding to the next stage of the CCS competition. The draft policies covered: • overarching energy policy • coal and carbon capture and storage • nuclear power • renewable energy • gas supply and storage • electricity transmission and grid The new nuclear power plants are scheduled to begin operating within the next decade, paving the way for the most ambitious fleet of new nuclear reactors in Europe. The 11th site, Dungeness, was turned down because of the \"adverse effect\" it could have on the unique local ecosystem identified by Natural England, Miliband said. The government also turned down three other sites not on the original list: Kingsnorth in Kent, Owston Ferry in South Yorkshire and Druridge Bay in Northumberland. The full list of sites designated by the government as suitable for new nuclear plants is: Sizewell, Suffolk; Hartlepool, Cleveland; Heysham, Lancashire; Sellafield, Cumbria; Braystones, Cumbria; Kirksanton, Cumbria; Wylfa Peninsula, Anglesey; Oldbury, Gloucestershire; Hinkley Point, Somerset, and Bradwell, Essex. Miliband said: \"The threat of climate change means we need to make a transition from a system that relies heavily on high-carbon fossil fuels, to a radically different system that includes nuclear, renewable and clean coal power. The current planning system is a barrier to this shift. It serves neither the interests of energy security, the interests of the low-carbon transition, nor the interests of people living in areas where infrastructure may be built, for the planning process to take years to come to a decision.\" He also reiterated plans announced earlier in the year for a new generation of coal power stations that would have to capture and store carbon when opened. Such CCS coal power stations were criticised today by an expert in the field, who said the government's competition to build demonstration carbon capture and storage plants was \"dead on its feet\". Professor Stuart Hazeldine, geologist at the University of Edinburgh, said only one of three CCS projects - that proposed by Scottish Power at Longannet - is capable of delivering a full-scale demo plant by 2014. The new planning system for large infrastructure should also help push through the government's plans for 10,000 new wind turbines, as announced in Low-carbon transition plan in July. The policy statements continue a shift from a hands-off free market approach to energy towards greater state intervention in energy generation. The Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) pointed to previous delays in new energy developments, such as the six years and 340 inquiry days it took the Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk to clear the planning system. \"The truth is we're not going to be able to deliver a 21st-century energy system with a 20th-century planning system,\" said Miliband. \"Saying no everywhere would not be in the national interest.\" The government's new planning quango, the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC), which was set up earlier this year, will begin considering applications for projects from March 2010. The first applications to the commission (pdf) include plans from French company EDF for new nuclear power stations at Hinckley Point and Sizewell, plus a massive offshore wind farm by Germany's RWE Innogy at Triton Knoll, off the east coast of England. Only energy developments over 50MW onshore and 100MW offshore will be overseen by the IPC. Greg Clark, the Conservative shadow energy and climate secretary, said his party supported the planning statements. But he said: \"What we have just heard is the declaration of a national emergency for our energy security, and the question that the minister must answer is why did they leave it so late to act? Britain's consumers and businesses will pay through the nose for the last-minute scramble he has announced today to cope with the blackouts he predicted in July.\" Caroline Lucas, the leader of the Green party, said: \"Bypassing the planning system in this way is bad news for democracy and for the environment. A key democratic right is for the public to have a say on how their area is developed. Decision-making about where we get our energy from, and the long-term costs associated with nuclear, should be opened up to more accountability, not less.\" Friends of the Earth said it was concerned about limits on individuals' ability to comment on major projects such as new power stations, because schemes through the updated planning process will not be open to public inquiry. Green groups and the Liberal Democrats also condemned the government's push for new nuclear power stations. Robin Oakley, head of Greenpeace's climate and energy campaign, said: \"The publication of the draft nuclear national policy statement is a reminder of just how many hoops the industry has still to jump through. It shows that new nuclear is by no means a done deal. We don't need coal or nuclear, because proven green technologies such as wind and combined heat and power stations can secure Britain's energy needs, create green jobs and slash our emissions.\" Liberal Democrat energy and climate change spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: \"A new generation of nuclear power stations will be a colossal mistake regardless of where they are built. New plants in the UK have never been built without massive cost to the taxpayer and a lethal legacy of toxic waste.\" Decc said the draft policy statements will be consulted on between now and 2010, when they are expected to be finalised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/nov/06/shipyard-closure-announcement-and-pmqs-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-06T16:42:08Z","webTitle":"Shipyard job losses announcement and PMQs: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/06/shipyard-closure-announcement-and-pmqs-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/nov/06/shipyard-closure-announcement-and-pmqs-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Shipyard job losses announcement and PMQs: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, has said he would expect Scotland to lose naval shipbuilding contracts if it votes for independence. He made the point in a BBC News interview where he was much more explicit about would happen in the event of a yes vote in the referendum than he was when asked about this in the Commons. He was speaking in general germs, but also referring to an order for Type 26 global combat ships. The Ministry of Defence is expected to order 13 of them from Glasgow, but the contract will not be finalised until after the referendum. This is what Hammond said when asked what would happen if the Scots voted to leave the UK. The UK has always built complex warship in the United Kingdom so that it has sovereign control over the operation of those contracts. If we changed our position at some point in the future and decided that we wanted to compete contracts for complex warships in the open market, with countries outside the UK being able to bid, then that would open up the market to all sorts of competitors.What I have said, and I will say again today, is I see no reason to expect that the UK would want to change from the position that we will build complex warships in the UK for reasons of maintaining sovereign capability in the future. • Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, has played down the suggestion that independence would lead to Govan losing naval contracts. The Clyde's won these contracts because it's the best place to build the frigates. That won't change with independence. She also insisted that Govan was viable without naval contracts. Naval procurement will be part of that future but we need to do more to seek export work and diversify beyond naval orders alone. Other maritime countries, of similar size to Scotland, like Norway, support much bigger shipbuilding industries than Scotland. • The Unite union described David Cameron's comments about possible legislation to stop direct action by unions as \"an attack on freedom\". (See 2.47pm.) A spokesman issued this statement. Protest is about the freedom of expression. That is what David Cameron is threatening. Ordinary working people do not have the benefit of national newspapers or the floor of the Commons when it comes to expressing their views. Now it seems the Tories want to gag them. All Unite organised protests have been lawful. None have breached the right of privacy. All have been conducted silently when at a place of residence. No-one, least of all children, has been intimidated. Their purpose has been to ensure that the community knows how workers are being treated and that companies act within moral parameters. This is not an attack on Unite. It is an attack on freedom, from a government devoted to protecting the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone else. • Cameron and the South Korean president Park Geun-hye have announced plans to double trade between the two countries by 2020. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's an afternoon Govan/Portsmouth reading list. I've already mentioned Severin Carell's analysis of the politics of the decision. Here are some other articles worth reading. • Dan Milmo at the Guardian says the decline of the British shipbuilding industry was not inevitable. Conversations with veteran industrialists about the state of shipbuilding today do not yield whimsical reminiscence of the good old days. Instead they produce regrets that tough commercial decisions – of the kind that saw France and Germany aggressively pursue markets such as nuclear power or premium cars – were not made in Britain in the 70s and 80s. Sir John Parker, the former chief executive of Harland and Wolff, the much-diminished Belfast shipbuilder, said the industry missed an opportunity in the Thatcher era. \"One of my big industrial disappointments or even failures is that I failed to persuade the government of the day that there was a big future in building cruise ships. Whoever used run-of-the-mill bulk carriers or tankers drifted to the lowest-cost country. So how you survived in higher-cost countries was more sophisticated ships like cruise ships. I saw that there was going to be a lot of growth in cruise ship building so we demonstrated that this was a real growth industry. And nearly 25 years on, those forecasts would have underestimated the demand.\" Thus the industry drifted to the east. • Iain Martin at the Telegraph says the problems started even earlier. The reality is that British shipbuilding has been in trouble since shortly after the Second World War. Commercially we fell behind, even though globally this is a golden age of shipping when tens of thousands of vast container ships criss-cross the globe carrying goods between continents. The decline in shipbuilding here had its roots in poor management stretching back to the late 19th century, trade union obstinacy, and the rise after two world wars of foreign rivals who could produce much bigger ships more efficiently. Capital which might have been invested in the UK catching up went elsewhere, when quite sensibly those with said capital observed that it could get much higher returns if invested in sectors and other markets that did not have the problems inherent in British shipbuilding and heavy industry. • Nick Robinson on his BBC blog says ministers started discussing the idea of ending naval shipbuilding at Portsmouth and locating it all at Govan three years ago - long before the Scottish independence referendum was announced. • Con Coughlin in the Telegraph says the English \"are paying too high a price for keeping a few querulous Scots on side\". Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, has been tweeting about the job losses. As well as writing to BAE Systems, she could, of course, ask Philip Hammond, the defence secretary. She's his PPS. That explains why, despite being a local MP, she did not speak in the Commons when Hammond made his statement. (Hammond was asked what would happen in the event of a yes vote in the Scottish referendum. See 2.47pm.) • BAE Systems has announced that it is cutting almost 1,800 jobs and calling an end to 500 years of shipbuilding in Portsmouth. The shipyard will close by the end of 2015, with heavy job losses there and in Scotland. The job cuts were announced by BAE Systems, but the decision was taken in consultation with the Ministry of Defence, and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, gave details in a statement to the Commons. He said there was no longer enough defence work available to keep shipbuilding going in both Glasgow and Portsmouth and that it made sense to consolidate the work in one location. As part of the announcement, remaining aircraft carrier work will be completed in Glasgow, three new ocean-going patrol vessels are being built there (relatively cheaply, for less than £100m, because, under the terms of its contract with BAE Systems, the government was doing to otherwise have to pay for the shipbuilders to remain idle) and in future the planned 13 Type 26 frigates will be built there too. Hammond told MPs: Consolidation of the ship-building industry is not a single event. It has been a process that's been going on for decades ... I'm afraid the logic of the size of the Royal Navy and the budget that we have for building new ships, the inexorable logical is that we can only support one naval shipbuilding location in the United Kingdom. Anything else, I'm afraid, is fantasy economics. • Hammond has hinted that Glasgow could lose the Type 26 contract if Scotland votes for independence. When asked in the Commons if the order would go ahead if the Scots vote to leave the UK next September, he refused to give a direct answer. But he did stress that the final Type 26 contracts would not be agreed until after the referendum. • A Conservative MP has complained about jobs in Portsmouth being \"sacrificed\" to protect the Scots. Caroline Dinenage, the MP for Gosport, made the claim on the World at One. The fact that Scottish jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the south coast, which is an area of equal economic need, for us is devastating and very upsetting. Mike Hancock, the MP for Portsmouth South, also claimed that the desire not to upset Scottish voters ahead of next years's referendum was a factor in the decision. (See 11.28am.) Asked about this, Hammond said the decision to end shipbuilding in Portsmouth was taken by BAE Systems. • Vernon Coaker, the shadow defence secretary, has signalled that Labour will not oppose the decision. This is what he said in the Commons. When the Government does the right thing on defence, especially where difficult decisions need to be taken, they will have the support of Labour. We always say and do what we believe is in the interests of Britain and its people. These are complicated and detailed matters and it will take some time to fully examine the consequences of today's announcements by BAE Systems and the government. • David Cameron has said the government will consider acting to stop cases of industrial intimidation following claims the bosses of a petrochemicals plant in Scotland were intimidated by trade union activists. As the Press Association reports, at PMQs Cameron accused Labour of \"ducking its responsibilities\" by failing to order an investigation into claims Unite officials were involved in a campaign to intimidate the families of bosses at Ineos, which runs the petrochemicals plant at Grangemouth. He said he was shocked by allegations the children of executives had seen \"wanted\" posters put through their letter boxes, while their neighbours had been told they were \"evil\". The Tory MP Damian Collins asked him: \"Do you agree with me that the authorities should always investigate allegations of harassment against employees and their families, including when they are allegedly involving members of the trade unions?\" Cameron replied: You are absolutely right - they are very serious these allegations of industrial intimidation. They need to be properly looked at. Because the party opposite is ducking its responsibilities, we will have to consider what we can do to look at this. I have to say that the leader of the Labour party is behaving like the mayor of a Sicilian town towards the mafia - 'they put me in and I don't want them to take me out' ... We have seen 'wanted' posters put through children's letter boxes, we have seen families intimidated and we have seen people's neighbours being told that they are 'evil'. It is completely shocking what happened. It is also shocking that the Labour party is refusing to have a review and stand up to Len McCluskey and at this late stage they should do so. Later a Labour source said: The prime minister has got an MP involved in a cash-for-contacts scandal, he has got a chairman who the Metropolitan Police say may have committed fraud, he has got a transport minister using tax havens. What we have seen this week is a return to Tory sleaze. The prime minister should stop lecturing the Labour party and start cleaning up the Conservative party. • Cameron has dismissed Miliband's claim that NHS accident and emergency services in England are in \"crisis\". • Cameron has said he is \"looking carefully\" into claims that a Tory councillor wanted in connection with a murder in Pakistan was invited to a party at No 10. At PMQs Labour's Tom Blenkinsop asked: Last month, Tory councillor Abdul Aziz was at an invite-only party in No 10. Councillor Aziz is subject to an arrest warrant in Pakistan in connection to a brutal murder. After shaking this man's hand and having photos taken at No 10 with this gentleman, would you now like to say that you think this gentleman should return to Pakistan and face justice? Mr Cameron replied: \"I am looking carefully into this case and I will write to you.\" • Five disabled people have succeeded in a legal challenge to the government's decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund. • The Conservative MP Mark Pritchard has referred himself to the standards watchdog following an undercover newspaper investigation that alleged he used membership of a parliamentary group to try to set up business deals. • Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, has said that flouting European judges over prisoner voting would risk international \"anarchy\". As the Press Association reports, he told a committee that said sticking to international rules could be \"irksome\" at times. But it had been the \"settled view\" of British governments for centuries that such obligations should be met. • Lawyers for David Miranda, the partner of a Guardian journalist held for nine hours at Heathrow under anti-terror laws, have urged High Court judges to rule that his detention was unlawful and breached his fundamental right to freedom of expression. There are more details on our NSA files live blog. • The first sign of the impact of a tougher benefit sanctions regime has emerged with the publication of Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) statistics showing that nearly 600,000 jobseeker's allowance (JSA) claimants have had adverse benefit sanctions taken against them in the eight months to June. My colleague Severin Carrell has written an analysis of the significance of the shipyard job losses announcement, and what it means for Scotland. He says it is a mistake to see this as a sop to Alex Salmond. Here's an extract. This week the GMB, the dominant union at BAE's Clyde shipyards and the third largest trade union in Scotland, announced it would support the no campaign in the referendum, provoking the ire of the nationalists but underscoring the political significance of this industry. The decision to defend jobs in Scotland is no sop to Alex Salmond and his Scottish Nationalist government: confirmation that the Royal Navy's next-generation Type 26 frigate will be built on the Clyde is intended to be a challenge from the UK government to his plans for independence. The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, recently said both yards would close – and contracts for the navy's next-generation Type 26 frigates would be lost – if Scotland voted for independence, since no UK government would pay a foreign shipyard to build its warships. In that scenario, warship-building would return to Portsmouth, perhaps with hundreds of Glaswegian shipbuilders heading south following that work. Here's the Labour MP John Denham responding to Philip Hammond's statement on Twitter. Philip Hammond's statement is now over. I'll post a summary soon. Hammond says the current assumption is that the government will eventually order 13 of the new Type 26 frigates. Peter Luff, the Conservative former defence minister, asks what the purpose of the three new boats will be. Hammond says they will be able to carry out a range of duties, including anti-smuggling operations and defending overseas territories. Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that the second aircraft carrier will be put into service. Hammond says this decision will be taken in the defence review in 2015. But his personal view is clear. Having spent £3bn building it, he thinks spending £70m a year having it in service will be good value for money. Hammond says SNP policies would drive shipbuilding out of Scotland. His announcement today will make the Clyde the centre of shipbuilding in the UK, he says. Hammond says there is only enough demand for one shipbuilding centre in the UK. Anything else is \"fantasy economics\", he says. Tracey Crouch, Conservative MP for Chatham, says Chatham was blighed by the closure of the dockyard there 30 years ago. Hammond says Portsmouth will not become a \"historic port\" (ie, no longer a working one) like Chatham. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative and a former chair of the public accounts committee, asks for an assurance that defence contracts will not in future be delayed in the way the carrier contract was delayed, with the result the cost went up. Hammond says when the carrier project was finalised, the cost was set at £3.6bn. At one stage it had been £3.2bn. But he has not met anyone who thought it would come in for £3.6bn, he says. That was always a \"fantasy\" figure. Labour's Thomas Docherty asks if the Type 26 order will stay in the Clyde if Scotland votes for independence. Hammond says the Type 26 order will not be finalised until the design is ready. That will not be until the end of next year. So the question does not apply now, he says. George Hollingbery, a Conservative, pays tribute to the work done by Penny Mordaunt to support the shipbuilding industry in Portsmouth. Hammond agrees. Since he has known her, she has talked of little else, he says. Labour's Cathy Jamieson asks what works has been done to allow shipbuilders to diversify into other industries. Hammond says this is a matter for the Scottish government. Mark Hoban, the Conservative, asks if the land released by the closure of the shipbuilding yard in Portsmouth could be released for use by the commercial port. Hammond says this is being looked at. Hammond says that if Scotland were not part of the UK, he would not have been able to make this announcement today. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP for Chichester, asks how many compulsory redundancies there will be. And can he give an assurance that no jobs are being lost in Portsmouth to save jobs in Glasgow? Hammond says it was BAE Systems that decided where the job losses should fall. The MoD concurred, he says. And he says he expects 940 jobs to go from Portsmouth. Labour's John Denham, the Southampton Itchen MP, says the last Labour government secured the future of shipbuilding on the south coast. This government has failed to win new orders for Portsmouth, he says. Hammond says Labour did nothing to secure new global orders for the UK defence industry. Sir Nick Harvey, the Lib Dem former defence minister, asks if other shipbuilders will get the chance to bid for the contract to build the three new ships. Hammond says they won't have that chance. This is a deal with BAE Systems. It is designed to \"soak up\" the money that the government would be spending anyway. The SNP's Angus Robertson asks Hammond if he agrees with BAE Systems that new frigates should be built in Glasgow. Hammond says it is BAE System's judgement that the Type 26 combat ship should be built on the Clyde. The MoD agrees with that, he says. Labour's Ian Davidson asks Hammond to confirm that the order for the new ships will not actually be confirmed until after the Scottish referendum. Hammond says the government will not finalise an order for ships that have not yet been designed. That was the mistake Labour made with the aircraft carriers, he says. That would amount to writing a blank cheque to the supplier. Mike Hancock, the Portsmouth South MP, asks why work from Portsmouth is being transferred to Glasgow. And will any of the MoD money to Portsmouth be clawed back via the city deal. Hammond says moving three carrier blocks to the Clyde will enable the yard to stay viable into the future. And he says that, as part of the city deal, he expects the MoD to make land available for development. Labour's Jim Sheridan says he is a former shipyard worker. He asks Hammond to contrast BAE Systems with the employer at Grangemouth. One respects the workforce, one doesn't, he says. Hammond says that he thinks industrial relations at BAE Systems are good. Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative MP for Gosport, asks for more details of the Portsmouth city deal. Hammond says he accepts this is a bad announcement for Portsmouth. But it should be kept in context. Some 11,000 jobs remain. An announcement about a city deal will be made very soon, he says. Hammond says this announcement secures a sustainable ship building industry in the UK. James Arbuthnot, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, asks if Hammond is going to bring both aircraft carriers into service. Hammond says that decision will be made in the strategic defence review in 2015. But whether it is brought into service of mothballed, it will be based at Portsmouth. Hammond is responding to Coaker. He says Coaker will have to check his facts. Coaker said the carrier programme originally cost £3.2bn. But, almost as soon as it was announced, the Labour government announced a two-year delay, adding £1.6bn to the costs. Hammond says unions have been engaged in trying to save the shipbuilding industry. He says the unions accept that the aircraft carrier contract led to a surge in jobs, and that this was not going to be sustained. He says he would be more than happy to have a long conversation with Coaker about the £38bn black hole in the defence budget. He says he cannot give Coaker a guarantee that the cost of the carriers project will rise. But now BAE Systems have an incentive to keep costs down. He says the government acted in the interests of the whole UK. Vernon Coaker, the shadow defence secretary, is responding to Hammond. Coaker suggests the government support the aircraft carriers programme when it was started by Labour. On the job losses, he asks what discussions Hammond has had with the Department for Business about ensuring shipbuilding skills are not lost. The 2012 white paper on national security said skills were not considered as a national security matter. Coaker says Hammond's claim that the government inherited a £38bn black hole in the defence budget is not credible. The NAO does not accept that, he says. Can Hammond give more details about the cost of the three new ships being ordered? And can he says more about the future of the second aircraft carrier? Coaker asks for an assurance that the decisions were taken in the national interest, and not with a view to influencing the Scottish referendum. And what will happen if Scotland votes for independence? Britain must maintain the ability to build warships. Hammond turns to the BAE job losses announced today. He says the end of the the aircraft carrier construction meant job losses were inevitable. But BAE System has said they will do their best to find alternative jobs for workers. The government is looking at how a city deal for Portsmouth could help the area, he says. The Solent local enterprise partnership will look into this. And he says the government will invest £100m in expanding the naval base at Portsmouth. Hammond turns to the government's wider warship building agreement with BAE Systems. The government is still committed to a Type 26 combat ship. But construction will not start until 2016. That leaves a gap in the shipyard construction programme. Under the terms of the government's agreement with BAE Systems, the government would have to pay the workers anyway. But their skills would diminish because they would not be working. So the government has commissioned three new ships, she says. (See 11.35am.) Hammond says the government would have had to pay the workers anyway. Because of this, the cost of the new boats is less than £100m. Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, is making his statement now. The last government agreed to build two aircraft carriers. The coalition, when it came into power, was told it would cost more to cancel the contract than to go ahead with it. The public accounts committee said the contract was not fit for purpose. For every pound that the costs over-ran, the taxpayer would have to pay more than 90p. Hammond says he has renegotiated the contract. The new value will be £6.2bn. Any over-run will be shared 50:50 between operators and government until all the operators profits have been exhausted. This way, incentives are properly aligned. The original contract was \"lopsided\" and \"poorly-constructed\", he says. The governance of the contract has been changed too, he says. Sea trials are expected to start in 2017. Overall, this renegotiation will save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds. Labour's Susan Elan Jones says last year bonuses rose 91% faster than ordinary wages. Is the Cameron not willing to act? Or is he just too useless to do anything? Cameron says bonuses were higher under Labour. If Jones wants to see someone useless, she should look at her frontbench. Cameron says he wants to see more young people studying engineering. Labour's Alison McGovern asks how many of the new private sector jobs that Cameron boasts about involve people on zero-hour contracts. Cameron says he does not know the answer to that. But he says Labour-controlled Doncaster does not pay the living wage, while Conservative-controlled London does. Labour's Sharon Hodgson says the number of people unemployed in her constituency for more than two years has risen by 350%. Cameron says the claimant count is coming down. The government must do more to grow the economy, he says. But it won't grow if the government borrows more. Labour is the biggest threat to the economy, he says. Labour's David Winnick says World War Two was fought to bring about a fairer society. Yet Cameron's policies penalised the hard-pressed. What is happening is unacceptable and contemptible. Cameron says the government has taken 2.4m people out of poverty altogether. Labour's John Cryer says he is proud to be a trade unionist. Cameron says there are plenty of decent trade unionists. But it's their leaders who let them down, he says. He accuses them of being bullies, and of bulling the Labour leader. Mike Hancock, the Portsmouth MP, asks what the government will do to help the city following the job losses. Cameron says the MoD will be investing £100m in ship servicing work in Portsmouth. Philip Hammond will give more details in his statement. Sir Peter Tapsell, the Conservative, says in some countries the intelligence services are out of control. Is Cameron confident that is not the case in Britain? Cameron says there is a rule about not commenting on intelligence matters, but he tells Tapsell he has looked at what the intelligence services do carefully and he is sure they are accountable. Labour's Tom Blenkinsop says a Tory councillor subject to an arrest warrant in Pakistan was entertained at a reception in Number 10. Does Cameron agree he should return to Pakistan to face justice? Cameron says he is looking into this case and will write to Blenkinsop. Labour's Pat McFadden asks Cameron to admit that the Tpim regime was a mistake. Cameron says he does not accept this. Under control orders, seven people absconded. The control order regime was being continually \"hacked away\" by the courts, he says. There has to be some regime for people who cannot be prosecuted. But the government will make it \"as robust as possible\". Mark Reckless, a Conservative, asks the government to close a loophole that allows foreign buyers to buy property in London without paying capital gains tax. Cameron sidesteps the question, but says the rules were in place under Labour. The government has been closing loopholes already, he says. The SNP's Angus Roberston points out that the shipyard job losses did not come up at all in Cameron's exchanges with Miliband. Cameron says the government is announcing the building of three new warships on the Clyde. There will be job reduction, he says. But there are more jobs in ship servicing, he says. This government is building two new aircraft carriers, as well as destroyers and submarines. Snap PMQs Verdict: Miliband had the edge, I felt, but he did not score a clear-cut victory, and the exchanges started with confusing statistic-swapping, and ended with sloganising. Not a classic encounter. And Cameron is too clueless to know the facts, Miliband says. The NHS is failing because of Cameron's botched reorganisation. There is only one person responsible for the winter crisis - Cameron. Cameron says mixed-sex accommodation is down, 1.2m more are treated in A&amp;E, and the NHS is getting better. Labour never stands up for the NHS. Miliband says Cameron is complacent and clueless. It is heading into the winter with fewer nurses. The NHS is not safe in his hands. Cameron says there are more A&amp;E nurses than there were five years ago. He stands up for the NHS. When will Miliband understand that his job is to stand up to Unite. Miliband says Cameron is out of touch. He lists a series of health statistics going up. And it is because of his NHS reorganisation. How many NHS managers received a six-figure pay-off? Cameron says there are 20,000 fewer managers in the NHS. But he quotes figures showing numbers of health staff are going up. Miliband says Labour warned that care would be affected. Some 2,300 manages have received six-figure pay-offs, he says. So Cameron is giving P45s to nurses and six-figure pay-offs to managers. How many of those managers have been remployed? Cameron says for the first time managers who are re-employed have to pay back money. And the reorganisation is saving £4.5bn. Miliband is too weak to stand up to poor health management in Labour's Wales. Ed Miliband echoes what Cameron said about veterans. Can Cameron guarantee there won't be an A&amp;E crisis this winter. Cameron says the government will do all it can. It has met its A&amp;E target 27 weeks in a row. It is treating more than 1.2m patients in A&amp;E. And there won't be a winter crisis in Wales - because there is an NHS crisis there already. Miliband says Cameron is wrong. The government has missed its target on A&amp;E for 15 consecutive weeks, he says. He notes that Cameron could not guarantee that there would not be a crisis. Cameron repeats the 27 weeks in a row point. Now the average waiting time in A&amp;E is 50 minutes. When Andy Burnham was in charge, it was 70 minutes, he says. Steve Baker, a Conservative, says businessmen, decent trade unionists and papers like the Daily Mirror will have been appalled by the so-called Leverage tactics of Unite in the Grangemouth dispute. Will Cameron ensure families are protected from militants? Cameron says this sort of intimidation is unacceptable. People's neighbours have been told they are evil. That is shocking. It is disgraceful that Ed Miliband will not order a review. David Cameron starts by saying, with Remembrance Day coming, he would like MPs to remember all those who served the country in conflict. I will be focusing on PMQs for the next half an hour (which is bound to include questions about the job losses). Then I will be covering the statement from Philip Hammond about shipbuilding in detail. This is from the shipyard at Portsmouth. In the Commons a few minutes ago Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, was asked about the job losses in Scotland. \"It was a day we always knew was coming,\" he said. But he promised to work with politicians from other parties, and with the Scottish government, to mitigate the effects of the job losses. I was not at the Number 10 lobby briefing, but it seems that Number 10 is not denying that referendum concerns played a part in the decision to focus job losses on Portsmouth. Here is some snap reaction to the BAE Systems announcement. From Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer for shipbuilding This is a very worrying time for the workforces and their families as the work on the two carriers comes to a conclusion. Unite will be working very hard to retain the maximum number of jobs at both Portsmouth and in Scotland. It is a huge blow to Britain's manufacturing and industrial base, with many highly skilled workers faced with losing their jobs. We will have to examine the BAE business case in detail to see how we can secure a future for the workforces at both Portsmouth and in Scotland. We believe that, if this is approached in a constructive and innovative way, it can be achieved. The seeds for this situation were sown in the 1980s when the Thatcher government used European structural funds to close shipyards, rather than funding investment that would have allowed Britain to compete in the global marketplace for shipbuilding orders against the likes of South Korea. From Steve Murphy, general secretary of construction workers union Ucatt Once again workers have found out that their jobs are under threat through the media. It is highly distressing and extremely unfair to treat a loyal workforce in such a way. This is a highly skilled workforce, so it is absolutely essential that the government and BAE Systems minimises job losses, guarantees the long-term future of all the shipyards and continues to invest in training the workers of the future. From Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council I condemn the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in England with the capability to build advanced surface warships. This decision is bad for Portsmouth, with the loss of many highly-skilled jobs, but it's also bad for the defence of the UK and for the Royal Navy. The remaining yards with the capability to build advanced warships are in Scotland, and the referendum on Scottish independence is less than one year away. Ministers have put the defence of the UK and the future of the navy at real risk. We will work as hard as we can to protect jobs in Portsmouth. Portsmouth remains the home of the Royal Navy, with more than 10,000 jobs remaining in the dockyard. From Maureen Frost, executive director of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce Losing the shipbuilding side is devastating news for the city. It's also about the supply chain and those small businesses that supply into BAE Systems so there's going to be a major impact. The Ministry of Defence has now put out its own statement about the announcement. It ignores the job losses, and instead focuses on the new orders going to Glasgow and a plan to expand the naval base in Portsmouth. Bizarrely, it is actually headlined: \"NEW SHIPS FOR ROYAL NAVY SECURE UK SHIPBUILDING SKILLS.\" Here's what it says. The MoD plans to commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy in a deal that will sustain jobs in the UK’s warship building industry. The new ships, which will be built by BAE Systems at their shipyards on the Clyde, will play a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations. The agreement with BAE Systems provides work for the company between the completion of the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers and the Type 26 Global Combat Ship, securing the vital skills needed to build the UK’s future warships. The Defence Secretary is also announcing today that more than £100 million will be invested in Her Majesty’s Naval Base Portsmouth, which will be home to both HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. The money will expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of the Royal Navy’s biggest ever warships as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. Under the Terms of Business Agreement signed with BAE Systems in 2009 the MoD would have been liable to pay for any periods when no shipbuilding was taking place at UK yards. Building Offshore Patrol Vessels means not only are staff at BAE Systems able to continue to work and maintain their skills, but the Royal Navy benefits from three new ships and the taxpayer gets much better value for money. The cost of building the ships is funded from money that would have been used to pay for idle capacity, finance redundancies and meet the cost of industrial restructuring. Portsmouth will maintain its proud maritime heritage as the home of much of the Royal Navy’s surface fleet and the centre of BAE Systems ship support and maintenance business. And here's the statement from Philip Hammond, the defence secretary. This deal will provide the Royal Navy with three brand new maritime patrol vessels with a wide range of capabilities which will support our national interests and those of our OverseasTerritories. This is an investment not only in three ships but in this country’s warship building industry. It prevents workers standing idle and sustains the vital skills needed to build the planned Type 26 frigate in the future. I am also pleased to announce additional investment in Portsmouth Naval Base to prepare for the significant increase in tonnage as the home port for the Royal Navy’s aircraft carriers and destroyers. Here is more from the interview Mike Hancock, the Portsmouth South MP, gave to BBC News earlier. (See 10.50am.) • Hancock said he believed that the desire to minimise job losses in Scotland ahead of next year's independence referendum was a factor in the decision to concentrate job losses in Portsmouth. The political side of it is undoubtedly this has to play for the Scottish referendum, and you have to be pretty kind to the government to believe this didn't play some part in it. I think Alex Salmond was in a no-lose situation. He would benefit if they closed the yard by saying they were being punished. If they keep the yards open, he will say they're being bribed. So from that point of view he's in a no-lose situation. But I think the people of Portsmouth will be paying a very heavy price for I think a slightly cynical manoeuvre. And I'm disappointed in that. • He said he expected David Cameron and the Department for Business to make an announcement later today about developing maritime industry in Portsmouth. • He said the he expected some of those who lost their jobs in the shipbuilding yards in Portsmouth to be able to transfer to BAE's ship-repair division at Portsmouth. And here are the additional notes from the BAE Systems news release. Portsmouth The company has extensive high end naval engineering operations in the Portsmouth area. After the proposed reductions announced today, BAE Systems will still employ approximately 3,200 people across its sites at HM Naval Base Portsmouth, Portsdown Hill, Broad Oak, Cowes, and HMS Collingwood. Portsmouth based engineers will be retained to support the design and development of the Type 26 frigate programme. The Company's Maritime Services business, based in Portsmouth, manages the running of HM Naval Base on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. The Queen Elizabeth Class carriers are expected to be based in the Portsmouth from 2017. The business also provides support services to the Royal Navy's Portsmouth flotilla, including the six Type 45 destroyers, which accounts for around 50% of the surface fleet. Glasgow BAE Systems operates two shipyards in Glasgow, Govan and Scotstoun, currently employing 3,200 people. These sites are supporting the manufacture of the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers and design of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship Type 26 Global Combat Ship The assessment phase for the Type 26 programme started in March 2010. A combined Ministry of Defence and BAE Systems team of approximately 550 engineers in Bristol, Glasgow and Portsmouth are currently working to develop the detailed specification for the vessel, with a manufacturing contract expected to be awarded at the end of 2014. Here's the full statement from BAE Systems. I've highlighted the key paragraph in bold. BAE Systems has reached agreement in principle with HM Government on measures to enable the implementation of a restructuring of its UK naval ships business. The agreement will result in: · Restructuring of the contract for the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier programme. · Provision of additional shipbuilding work prior to the start of the Type 26 Global Combat Ships programme. · Rationalisation of the UK naval ship business to match future capacity requirements. In 2009, BAE Systems entered into a Terms of Business Agreement (ToBA) with the Ministry of Defence that provided an overarching framework for significant naval shipbuilding efficiency improvements in exchange for commitments to fund rationalisation and sustainment of capability in the sector. The agreements announced today, together with an anticipated contract for the design and manufacture of the Type 26 Global Combat Ships programme, will progressively replace that ToBA. Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier BAE Systems, with the other participants in the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, has agreed change to the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier contract. Under the revised terms, the contract will be amended to accommodate programme changes and activities previously excluded from the contract. Under the new Target Cost contract the industrial participants' fee will move to a 50:50 risk share arrangement providing greater cost performance incentives. The maximum risk to the industrial participants will continue to be limited to the loss of their profit opportunity. The revised contract reflects the increased maturity of the programme, with structural assembly of the first of class vessel now substantially complete. Interim shipbuilding workload A significant reduction in workload will follow the peak of activity on the Aircraft Carrier programme, the six Type 45 destroyers and two export contracts. The anticipated Type 26 programme will, in future years, address some of that workload reduction. In the interim period, a proposed contract for the manufacture of three Offshore Patrol Vessels, announced today, will provide additional capability for the Royal Navy and sustain key shipbuilding skills. Restructuring of the Naval Shipbuilding business Following detailed discussions about how best to sustain the long-term capability to deliver complex warships, BAE Systems has agreed with the UK Ministry of Defence that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships. Consequently, and subject to consultation with trade union representatives, the Company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy. Under these proposals, shipbuilding operations at Portsmouth will cease in the second half of 2014. Subject to consultation, Lower Block 05 and Upper Blocks 07 and 14 of the second Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier will be allocated to Glasgow. The Company remains committed to continued investment in the Portsmouth area as the centre of its Maritime Services and high-end naval equipment and combat systems business. Consultation will commence on a total employee reduction of 1,775 that is expected to result from these restructuring proposals, including 940 in Portsmouth in 2014 and 835 across Filton, Glasgow and Rosyth, progressively through to 2016. The cost of the restructuring will be borne by the Ministry of Defence. The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK. BAE has now announced its planned job losses. This is from the Press Association. Defence giant BAE Systems is to consult on 1,775 potential job losses across its naval ships business. Around 940 roles are under threat in Portsmouth during 2014, and a further 835 in Scotland, according to sources. An official announcement is expected shortly to confirm fierce speculation about the scale of cuts in BAE's three main yards - Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. Shipbuilding operations will end in Portsmouth in the second half of next year, but an engineering team will be retained to support the new Type 26 warships, which will be built in Glasgow. Mike Hancock, the MP for Portsmouth South, has just told BBC News that he understands that around 500 core jobs will go at Portsmouth and a similar number of agency jobs. Many of them will \"fairly quickly\", he said. He also claimed that the desire to save jobs in Scotland ahead of next year's independence referendum was a factor. It was a \"slightly cynical manoeuvre\", he said. I'll post the full quotes in a moment. Vernon Coaker, the shadow defence secretary, told BBC News just now that he would be asking Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, what would happen to the Royal Navy shipbuilding contracts going to Glasgow in the event of Scotland voting for independent. Asked about Ian Davidson's proposal for a break clause in the contract (see 10.26am) , Coaker said he did not know whether this was feasible. But he said Davidson was raising an important point. The really important thing for us is to ensure that this country has the capability, the capacity, to build the warships that it needs. We have some of the most skilled workers in the world in this country with respect to building those warships. You can't just turn those skills on and off. So we have to ensure that we have the capacity in those yards to keep those workers in work and to ensure that we can build the ships that we need. On STV last night Ian Davidson, the Labour MP for Glasgow South West, said that the government should continue to order ships from the yards in Scotland, but that there should be a break clause in the contract allowing the contract to be cancelled if Scotland votes for independence. Here's the video. And here's the key quote. I know that there's been a lot of pressure from both the government and the MoD to delay placing an order for the Type 26 [with Glasgow] because of the uncertainty caused by the referendum. Quite clearly, the British government has said specifically on a number of occasions that it will not place an order for warships in what would be a foreign country. What I've argued is that they should go ahead now, place the order, and if necessary have a claw-back clause in order that if, in the unlikely event that we vote for separation, they can take the work back in-house. The Channel 4 News journalist Michael Crick would like to see Mike Hancock, the MP for Portsmouth South, resign to fight a byelection over the job losses. But Hancock isn't very keen on the idea. Back to the shipyard job losses. We are getting an official announcement at 11am. And here's the latest Guardian story about the job losses. The Press Association has just snapped this. Five disabled people have won their Court of Appeal bid to overturn the government's decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund. And here's an extract from the story PA filed overnight with some background to the case. Five disabled people learn the outcome of their Court of Appeal bid to overturn the Government's decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund (ILF) today. Their appeal is against a High Court ruling by Mr Justice Blake in April upholding the Government's decision. The judge said the decision was not legally flawed, and the Government had not failed in its public sector equality duties. The ILF currently provides support enabling some 19,000 severely disabled people in the UK to live independent lives in the community. The five argued in the appeal court that the High Court had gone wrong in law and there was lack of proper consultation before the closure decision was taken on December 18 2012. Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, has been speaking to BBC News about the job losses. She is an MSP for a Glasgow constituency, but she implied that she did not want to see the story just in terms of Scotland v England. The first thing I would say, whether it is Portsmouth or the Clyde, we know these shipworkers are a very talented, very gifted, skilled workforce, and we have a solidarity right across the United Kingdom. We are sharing the concern now, the uncertainty. These are the people that need to be the focus of our considerations and deliberations at this time. Here's a blog from Peter Henley, the BBC's South of England political editor, about the job losses at Portsmouth. Here's an extract. I am told that the announcement has been brought forward to this morning due to leaks in the media. Everyone expects it to be curtains for shipbuilding. Some wonder whether BAE may also lose some of the maintenance contract for the surface fleet, perhaps to Babcock. It has become clear that while BAE is keen to work on low-risk ventures like the Type 26 it sees ship services, not ship building, as its future and so it is natural for them to rationalise facilities. The only good news could be an impending city deal worth at least £100m to help widen the marine industry in Portsmouth, with Rolls Royce Marine, Qinetiq maybe involved. Perhaps private refit work could provide some income at Basin 3 ... Considerations of the vote on Scottish independence seem to have trumped the hi-tech yard run by BAE in Portsmouth. The move of Vosper Thornycroft from Southampton to Portsmouth meant the kit was amongst the best in the world. But the Clyde carries more weight at the moment. Henley also points out that Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, is parliamentary private secretary to the defence secretary, Philip Hammond. This from the Press Association. More than 1,000 jobs are set to be axed at some of the UK's leading shipyards as defence work is reduced. Unions are braced for an announcement at 11am, including a decision not to build any new warships at the historic Portsmouth yard. BAE Systems is expected to reveal the scale of job losses in Portsmouth and its other two yards at Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. It is understood that repair and maintenance facilities will be upgraded at Portsmouth, mitigating the effect on jobs. New Type 26 warships will be built in Scotland, it is understood. Politicians in Portsmouth have expressed alarm at the expected cuts, as well as the impact on firms which service the yard. There are two parliamentary constituencies covering Portsmouth. Portsmouth North is a classic Labour/Tory marginal. It was Labour until 2010, but Penny Mordaunt won it for the Conservatives with a majority of 7,289. And Portsmouth South has been Lib Dem since 1997, when Mike Hancock won it from the Conservatives. In 2010 he had a majority of 5,200 over the Conservatives. UPDATE at 10.33am: Mysticnick in the comments reminds me that Hancock is now technically an independent, since he resigned the whip over the summer. On Twitter there is already some evidence of a backlash from the right against the idea that jobs are being lost in Portsmouth to save jobs in Glasgow. Here's the Daily Mail's James Chapman. And here is the Countryside Alliance's Tim Bonner. Here's the Guardian story from last night with background to today's shipyard closure announcement. We are going to get a major announcement about job losses at shipyards today. The BBC's Nick Robinson has been making the running with this story. He tweeted this about half an hour ago. And here is the top of the story running on the BBC's website. The announcement on job cuts at BAE's shipbuilding yards on the Clyde and the south coast of England is now expected to be made on Wednesday morning. It is understood shipbuilding at Portsmouth will stop. The company may cut more than 1,000 jobs in total between Portsmouth and the Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. It is thought Govan will not close. An announcement had originally been due on Thursday. Job losses on this scale normally have political consequences, as well as, of course, the real, immediate impact on the workers involved and their families. But in this case the Scottish independence referendum, and the desire to minimise the impact on Glasgow, has reportedly been a factor, and that may will trigger some kind of backlash. For an early flavour of that, see this from the Daily Mail's Tim Shipman. There will be a statement at 12.30pm. I'll be covering the statement, and the reaction, in detail. Here's the agenda for the day. 9.15am: Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, gives evidence to the committee considering the draft prisoner voting bill. 9.30am: Experts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and universities give evidence to the Commons work and pensions committee on the bedroom tax and other housing/welfare matters. 10.15am: Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific adviser, gives evidence to the Commons science committee on climate change. 12pm: David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs. 12.30pm: Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, gives a Common statement on shipyard job losses. 1pm: Cameron meets Park Geun-hye, the president of South Korea, at Downing Street. 2.30pm: Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland committee. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary after the Hammond statement and another after the home affairs committee hearing.

The first of your reports on Scotland (Scotland gets a choice of 'independence lite' in referendum, 10 October) similarly documents popular pressure for fuller autonomy for Wales and Northern Ireland and for full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, with the Scottish Lib Dems advocating \"fiscal federalism for all parts of the UK\", not just Scotland; and you report UK MPs inexplicably alarmed by Alex Salmond's indications of willingness to consider full fiscal autonomy for Scotland within the UK as a possible referendum alternative to independence. But it's apparently taboo to mention either of the elephants in the room: how long England will passively watch the other three UK nations moving inexorably towards full internal self-government while England alone is denied its obvious benefits; and why those seeking a credible policy for saving the UK from disintegration still can't see the obvious alternative to breakup, namely a full federation of the four UK nations – each eventually enjoying full internal self-government – with the Westminster parliament and government becoming the federal organs responsible for only those subjects that need to be managed on an all-UK basis. That, rather than disintegration, is the logical (and potentially most popular) culmination of the devolution process and, given some imaginative political leadership, one that could revolutionise the way we govern ourselves. There could be a rich reward for the first UK party leader to pick up this ball and run with it. Brian Barder London • The Scottish government does not have the power to hold a definitive referendum on Scotland's future. The constitution, in all its aspects, is a matter reserved to the United Kingdom parliament, and there are amendments tabled for the committee stage of the Scotland bill by both Lord Forsyth of Drumlean and myself which would require the UK government to hold an early referendum to end the uncertainty about Scotland's future. Salmond can argue that his victory in the Scottish election provides a mandate for a referendum to be held, but it is up to the UK parliament and government to determine when and how. George Foulkes Labour, House of Lords • Alex Salmond (The Tories and Lib Dems have no mandate here. Not a scintilla, 10 October) hints at Scottish territorial expansion. Scotland extends, he says, from John O'Groats to Hadrian's Wall. Thus, at a stroke, those of us who live in Northumberland north of the Wall find ourselves in Scotland. Mind you, that might be no bad thing! Janice Henney Harbottle, Northumberland • Why, in this time of dire troubles for the euro states (Slovakia rejects multibillion euro bailout fund to deal with debt crisis, 12 October), are there moves to create in the UK autonomous fiscal regimes chained together by a common currency? Keith Bilton London • Who is \"Scottish\"? Not me, apparently. I was born in Scotland, so were my parents and indeed all the ancestors I have traced so far. But I married an Englishman and now live in England. This has apparently stripped me of any claim to Scots-ness when it comes to referendums. It is little comfort to think that Mary Queen of Scots, were she alive today, would be in the same boat. Sue Atkins Lewes, East Sussex • In your recent articles on devolution, you referred to allowing some financial powers to Wales, including powers to raise minor forms of taxation, and also to control of the police, the justice system and broadcasting being devolved. Another area in which Wales lacks power is in the control of energy resources – frequently a point of conflict worldwide. Wales cannot truly move forward with confidence while there is no devolution of decisions on large-scale electricity generation, for example, on building nuclear power reactors, or on the larger schemes of wind, tidal or hydro-generation. Nor does Wales have powers over water catchment, crucially over whether more valleys should be flooded to supply water outside its borders. This has the potential to become even more of a flashpoint than it has been in the past. Some of these powers are now being reconsidered, but Welsh control of Welsh energy and water resources is still not on the agenda. Fflur Dafydd (Comment, 11 October) says \"the Welsh fledgling is ready to fly\". It needs control of its own resources to do so. Janet Davies Abergavenny • Simon Jenkins believes that, under devolution, Northern Ireland \"is moving further from the mainland and closer to Ireland proper\" (Comment, 12 October). This proposition is dubious at best. Support for Northern Ireland's remaining in the UK is, according to opinion poll evidence, rising even among nationalist voters in the province. Also, according to the polls, support for reunification is dropping in the Irish Republic; and an end to partition is no longer an issue in the Republic – Northern Ireland isn't mentioned in the conference speeches of the main party leaders, Sinn Féin apart. The Republic's economic crisis makes reunification even less of a practical possibility than it was before. It is hard to see Waterways Ireland and the other few cross-border bodies as vehicles taking Ulster into a united Ireland. And contrary to Mr Jenkins's claims, the Republic has not claimed Northern Ireland since a referendum altered its constitution after the Belfast agreement. CDC Armstrong Belfast • Re Simon Jenkins's piece on devolution: at the time of Bannockburn we did not have nations (although these were about to emerge). We had feudal allegiances. If you had called Edward Plantagenet an Englishman, he would have cut your head off. Robert the Bruce, for his part, took his name from Brix which is just outside Cherbourg. Bannockburn decided which Frenchman owned which bits of Britain. Nigel Agar Hitchin, Hertfordshire • Independence for Scotland, if only in fiscal matters, should be a good deal for England. First, the costs of bailing out dodgy Scottish banks, which were largely shouldered by English taxpayers, should be transferred to the Scottish budget. Second, the unfair differences between government expenditure per head between the two countries should be abolished, preferably sooner rather than later. Third, can we expect royalty payments from Scotland to England for those English inventions: the tartan and the kilt? If we removed the costs of featherbedding the Scots by England, the economic outlook would be rosy south of the border. Patrick Smith Upminster, Essex • With the increased pace of devolution, the West Lothian question will become ever more urgent. The only logical answer is to reconstitute the ancient English kingdoms such as Mercia, Northumberland and Wessex, and devolve to them powers similar to those of Scotland. The central parliament might then include representatives of the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and – who knows? – the Irish Republic. John Hurdley Birmingham • How can I make up my mind about Scottish independence/devolution max when I don't have even the most basic facts? What would a sovereign Scotland be like financially, ie would future oil revenues offset current transfers from Westminster? Someone must have done the sums; I think we should be told. Martyn Stevens Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire • After reading your article How British do we feel? (12 October), we tried to enter our allegiance online, however there is no Cornish flag. On old maps of Britain, Cornwall is shown as a country and we consider ourselves Cornish, not \"others\", as was used to describe Cornish voters in the paper. We don't see why you can't amend your interactive guide to reflect this.

Initial estimates put a figure of $10bn-$15bn (£6.2bn-£9.3bn) on the cost of the quake to insurers – which, if accurate, would rank the disaster among the 10 most costly of the last 30 years. Early assessments indicate that the insurance cost will exceed the $8.5bn bill after last year's Chilean earthquake, although it is unlikely to rival the record $71bn hit caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. Ultimately, however, natural disasters often stimulate activity, as nations are obliged to pick up the pieces and rebuild. Takuji Okubo, an analyst at Société Générale, said Japanese consumers would have to replace lost cars and appliances, and massive construction would be needed in devastated areas. \"The earthquake will most likely lead to stronger growth in 2011, rather than weaker,\" he said. The last big tragedy to hit Japan, the Kobe earthquake in 1995, resulted in $100bn of damage and required years of rebuilding. This time the quake hit the north of the country, which, with the exception of the million-strong city of Sendai, is relatively sparsely populated. Dan Ryan, a global economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"If even a small fraction of homes and structures are destroyed – or become structurally unsound and need to be rebuilt – then the damages would be in the tens of billions of dollars.\" The Japanese yen rallied late on Friday in the hours after the earthquake – not because of confidence about economic prospects but due to the prospect of stricken Japanese investors repatriating funds from overseas. Tokyo's stock market is likely to take a hit; in the week after the Kobe earthquake, Japan's Nikkei index dropped 6% and over six months the market slumped by 25%. The already elevated global price of oil, which is more than $100 a barrel, could be pushed higher as the fallout continues. In a research note, energy analysts at Barclays Capital said: \"More product from the bottom of the barrel could be required to replace lost nuclear generation. Rebuilding is an energy-intensive process.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/dec/24/libdem-fallout-over-cable-affair","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-24T00:05:04Z","webTitle":"Letters: Fallout for the Lib Dems over the Cable affair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/dec/24/libdem-fallout-over-cable-affair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/dec/24/libdem-fallout-over-cable-affair","fields":{"headline":"Fallout for the Lib Dems over the Cable affair","bodyText":"While Vince Cable displayed an astonishing lack of judgment to say what he said to complete strangers (I could press the button to end coalition, says Cable, 21 December), some of the concerns he voiced may provide a few crumbs of comfort for those of us wondering about our future in the Lib Dems. As he said, this government appears to have begun a Maoist revolution in large parts of public life. To take just one part – education – the pupil premium, while right, doesn't feel like adequate compensation for the utter chaos proposed for the education system as a whole. Higher education funding slashed, tuition fees tripled, the education maintenance allowance cut, more academies, and the introduction of the utterly crazy free schools – how does a rightminded Lib Dem support all that? The backdrop to this upheaval has been the threat of cuts in public spending greater than anything Mrs Thatcher proposed or would have dared to propose. Many of us on the outside have been in shock these last few months. We wanted to believe that our representatives in government knew what they were doing. Of course, coalition politics means compromise, but how could it be that our leaders didn't seem to understand the dangers that this coalition's policies pose to the very fabric of our society? So now we know. St Vince understood the risks. It's just that he couldn't do much about them. And now, his wings clipped, he can do even less. The rest of us must draw our own sobering conclusions. Alexis Rowell Former Lib Dem councillor, Camden • The noble arts of journalism and politics have both been dealt cruel blows this week (Report, 22 December). The undercover operation of the Telegraph was not an investigation into alleged corruption or rumours of misdemeanours, it was simple entrapment to elicit opinion and done within the special environment of the constituency surgery. After the dust has settled, we should hope for some serious public debate, and editorial reflection, on the journalistic ethics involved and the motivation behind the exercise. Where does it leave the right to personal views, the privacy of the MP's surgery and the ability of anyone dealing with journalists to speak for background or off-the-record, an essential element of media life on both sides of the process. The political profession did not fare much better. In addition to the arrows of misfortune striking the Lib Dems and the coalition, we had a display of shallow opportunism from Ed Miliband, who apparently has no objection to this form of investigation of personal opinion. Ed should beware as to who might be next, for it may not make comfortable reading when it comes to issues of leadership. It's been a slippery slope of a week in the UK in so many ways. Mike Lee London • What is really important is that an MP has actually spoken against Rupert Murdoch. How can we even pretend we live in a democracy when Murdoch has such power merely because of his wealth? How can we suppport Vince Cable – or anyone else – who is out to rid us of the meddling of the Murdoch family? Rachel Gibbons Hove • As Vince Cable could not hold responsibility for media policy because the decision on Murdoch is \"quasi-judicial\", what about Chris Huhne taking a quasi-judicial decision on nuclear power? Vince Cable disclosed his lack of impartiality to the undercover journalists, whereas Huhne's declarations for the coalition's nuclear power commitment were very public; he declared the only issue was economic. Yet Huhne approved two new nuclear reactor designs reactor designs under the \"justification\" regulations, and eight new reactor sites, for which he had to balance the benefits of nuclear electricity against the risks from accidents and sabotage, and the burden of nuclear waste on future generations. Environmentalists wanted a public inquiry under an independent inspector, but Huhne insisted on taking the decision himself. Why was he not removed as decision-maker, like Vince Cable? Is the difference the media spotlight or the threat of a Murdoch legal challenge? Ed Miliband's attack on Cable after his failure to attack Huhne certainly demonstrates lack of principle in the Labour opposition for transparent and unbiased decision-making. Max Wallis Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan • Mr Cable, what were you thinking of? You could have been foolishly indiscreet about Mother Teresa, Prince Andrew, Dame Judy Dench, even possibly the Baby Jesus, and got away with it. But Rupert Murdoch? Come off it.

But the trauma of seeing his family home abandoned amid the panic of a nuclear meltdown was compounded when he noticed a broken bathroom window. \"It looks like we have been burgled,\" the 63-year-old says, still too shaken to establish what is missing. \"I can't believe that someone is capable of stealing from the victims of a disaster.\" The intruders would have committed their crime with ease: Kowata's spacious house and garden lie about a mile from the scene of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, which has turned large swaths of nearby land into an official no-go zone. He was one of 80,000 people living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the nuclear plant who were told to evacuate by the government in the hours after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake launched a tsunami that crashed through its protective seawall and triggered meltdown in three of its six reactors. Kowata and more than 200 of his neighbours have been allowed to make a brief visit home to collect as many belongings as they can carry. It is a homecoming that many accept is likely to be their last. Dressed in protective suits, masks and goggles, they have been given just two hours to survey the damage to the houses they have been barred from entering since the triple disaster struck north-east Japan on the afternoon of 11 March. Months of radiation leaks from Fukushima Daiichi have rendered Okuma and the nearby town of Futaba uninhabitable for years, perhaps decades. According to a recent government report, the annual cumulative radiation dose in one district of Okuma is estimated at 508.1 millisieverts, more than 500 times the acceptable yearly level and, experts believe, high enough to increase the risk of cancer. \"We've been told that we can't return home because of the radiation,\" says Kinuko Yamada, a 53-year-old woman who is making the trip with her husband. \"I hope we can go back, but it could be 20 to 30 years before that happens. I'll probably be dead by then.\" Radiation levels in the town are so high that decontamination could take years, or not succeed at all. Residents have so far been allowed just this one brief visit, organised by the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] and nuclear safety officials. The Guardian was the only foreign media permitted to accompany them. Evidence of the area's dismal place in the history of Japan's nuclear power industry becomes visible soon after the convoy of buses passes through the police checkpoint. All traces of ordinary life have been cast in eerie suspension: roadsides are overgrown with grass and weeds; shops and restaurants lie empty, and grand farmhouses – evacuated in the hours following the accident, when Tepco officials were considering abandoning the plant – stand quiet and deserted. Toppled walls and scattered roof tiles are reminders of the staggering force of the quake that caused the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl. The only sound is the chirping of late-summer cicadas and the occasional beep of a Geiger counter. A scrawny black dog wanders into the road, sizes up his human visitors and scampers back into the woods. And just visible above a line of trees is the roof of one of Fukushima Daiichi's reactor buildings. As our bus drives past, radiation levels inside surge to 61 microsieverts an hour (compared to the typical Japanese average of 0.34 microsieverts).Elsewhere inside the exclusion zone, at least 1,000 cattle are roaming wild after escaping from their farm homesteads, according to local authorities. Most pets, and tens of thousands of cows, pigs and chickens have starved to death. A few days after residents returned to their homes, police officers and firefighters resumed the search for almost 200 tsunami victims in the area still listed as missing. Some residents are reluctant to openly criticise Tepco, a major local employer. \"I never worried about the nuclear plant before the tsunami,\" says one of Kowata's neighbours, a woman in her 60s who declines to give her name. \"When we left on 11 March we thought we would be back in a week or 10 days. Then the reactor buildings started exploding and we were more cautious, but even so I never thought it would be as bad as this. The power plant put food on the table around here ... I can't find the words to describe how I feel. \"I'm going to take back some valuables and our ancestors' spirit tablets – my parents are both dead. The earthquake left our family Buddhist altar in pieces, so I brought some flowers to place in front of it.\" Her garden, usually a blaze of colour at this time of year, is a tangle of weeds and wild grass. \"I spotted a few flowers blooming among the grass,\" she says. \"I love flowers and told them I was sorry for not being able to look after them properly.\" Inside, the doors have come away from their hinges and the walls have been pushed up by the force of the quake. \"It's terrible,\" she says. \"The kind of shock from which you can never recover. I want to come back, but it might be better for my peace of mind to stop hoping.\" However, Kowata, a former local government official who witnessed the arrival of MOX (mixed oxide) nuclear fuel at Fukushima Daiichi last year, makes no attempt to hide his bitterness towards Tepco. He has lived in this neighbourhood all his life and had only just built a new house, which he shared with four other members of his family. His father, like many other elderly tsunami survivors, died soon after being evacuated. \"I don't know how much Tepco and the government will give us as compensation, and in any case it will take a long time to arrive,\" says Kowata, who is living in rented accommodation in Aizu-Wakamatsu, a town farther inland. \"We can't wait around for them to take action. The nuclear accident is a man-made disaster. \"The government and Tepco kept telling us that this kind of thing could not possibly happen. Tepco hasn't changed when it comes to covering up trouble.\" Just two hours after they arrived, Okuma's residents must board buses to take them back outside the exclusion zone to be screened for radiation. They emerge from their homes gripping plastic bags bulging with clothes, valuables, heirlooms, children's toys and photo albums. Kowata gathers his belongings, walks out of his front door and turns the key one last time. \"As far as I am concerned, this is the last time I will see my home,\" he says. \"The house itself isn't very old ... it's a great shame.\" Halfway down the driveway he turns and fixes his gaze on the home he is leaving behind. \"I wanted to say thank you one last time. Now it's time to move on.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/may/02/connie-hedegaard-renewable-targets-2030","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-02T20:26:58Z","webTitle":"Connie Hedegaard seeks renewable energy targets for 2030","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/02/connie-hedegaard-renewable-targets-2030","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/may/02/connie-hedegaard-renewable-targets-2030","fields":{"headline":"Connie Hedegaard seeks renewable energy targets for 2030","bodyText":"The EU's climate chief is seeking to extend the bloc's renewable energy targets, in a move apparently designed to protect the green energy sector from an intensifying attack by the gas industry. This is the first time the European commission has raised the issue of mandatory targets beyond 2020, when the current commitment – to generate 20% of energy from renewable sources – expires. An extension would boost the renewable energy industry in the face of lobbying efforts by the gas industry, which is trying to rebrand gas as a cheaper \"green\" alternative to renewables. In its attempts to push this line, the gas industry has held a series of high-level meetings with senior figures in the European commission and the European parliament, as well as with the governments of member states. Connie Hedegaard, the climate change commissioner in Brussels, is concerned at the lobbying, and is determined to maintain Europe's lead in developing renewable energy and clean technology. \"We should be looking to avoid a lock-in to fossil fuels,\" she said. \"We should be discussing a renewable energy target for 2030. We need to have ambitious targets. It would be one way to send a long-term price signal for renewable energy – that renewable energy is not just going to stop growing after 2020.\" In an interview with the Guardian, Hedegaard declined to put a clear figure on what the renewable energy target should be beyond 2020. But others have suggested that it could be cost-effective to opt for a target of 40% by 2030. The push to extend the target is likely to be resisted by some member states who fought hard against the 2020 targets when they were unveiled in early 2007. Poland is known to be concerned that its heavy reliance on coal should not attract penalties, and Italy has a history of opposing climate targets.An official in the department of Günther Oettinger, the EU commissioner for energy, said no targets were yet needed beyond 2020. He is also against raising the current emissions-cutting target from 20% by 2020 to 30%, as some member states – including the UK, France and Germany – have proposed. A spokesman for José Manuel Barroso said the European commission president was following the arguments closely, but had no view on the matter of new targets. In its \"Roadmap to 2050\", the commission estimated that the share of low-carbon technologies – comprising renewables, nuclear power, and carbon capture and storage – in the electricity mix would have to rise to 75% or 80% by 2030. The gas industry's lobbying push has been inspired by the rapid expansion of shale gas, a controversial form of the fuel that is extracted from dense shale rock. Industry estimates suggest there may be enough of this and other so-called \"unconventional\" forms of gas, which are newly accessible because of advances in a technique known as hydraulic fracturing - \"fracking\" – to power the globe for two centuries. Lobbyists have circulated a report by the European Gas Advocacy Forum, co-authored by the consultancy McKinsey, that appears to show Europe could meet its 2050 greenhouse gas targets and save €900bn by opting for gas rather than renewable energy generation. However, the assertions of the gas industry are now in doubt. The EGAF report was adapted from a previous study that contradicts this claim, concluding that Europe should opt for more renewable power in order to meet its emissions targets and improve its energy security. The EGAF report has now been disowned by the original study's co-authors, the European Climate Foundation. A separate study from Cornell University also found that, because of the difficulties involved in its production, using shale gas for electricity generation produces as much carbon dioxide as coal, if not more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/30/japan-radioactive-contamination-marine-life","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-30T17:57:45Z","webTitle":"Japan fears radioactive contamination of marine life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/japan-radioactive-contamination-marine-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/30/japan-radioactive-contamination-marine-life","fields":{"headline":"Japan fears radioactive contamination of marine life","bodyText":"High levels of radiation in the sea off the coast of Fukushima have raised concerns over harm to local marine life and the risk of contaminated fish, shellfish and seaweed entering the food chain. Tests on seawater near the nuclear power plant showed that levels of radioactive iodine reached 3,355 times the legal limit on Monday, one of several peaks in recent days that have fallen rapidly as radioactive substances decayed and were steadily diluted and dispersed by ocean currents. Officials are watching levels of iodine-131 in seawater because although it has a half-life of eight days, meaning it is half as radioactive after that time, the substance builds up in seaweed, a common food in the Japanese diet. If consumed, radioactive iodine collects in the thyroid and can cause cancer. The International Atomic Energy Agency said iodine-131 in seawater would \"soon be of no concern\" presuming there are no further discharges of contaminated water from the power station into the sea. The IAEA added that Japanese authorities have released the first analyses of fish, caught at the port of Choshi, in Chiba prefecture south of Fukushima, which found one of five to be contaminated with a detectable level of caesium-137, a far more persistent radioactive substance, though at a concentration that was far below safety limits for consumption. Many countries, including Britain, have begun radiation testing of fish, shellfish and other fresh produce from Japan or have imposed wider bans on imports from the region. Fisheries are not entering waters within the 20km (12-mile) exclusion zone around Fukushima, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. The fate of many local seafood and shellfish farms, including scallops, oysters, sea urchins and sea snails, was sealed more than two weeks ago when the tsunami wiped out beds and destroyed fishing vessels and ports around Fukushima. In Iwate prefecture, authorities say the disaster may have wiped out businesses that account for 80% of the revenue of the region's fisheries. At the Fukushima power plant, engineers continued the arduous task of trying to pump contaminated water from turbine rooms and trenches, which is hampering work to connect the reactor cooling systems to the national grid. Tepco, the power station operator, plans to spray parts of the site with a resin to stop radioactive dust blowing off the site and is considering shrouding the reactor buildings with sheets to reduce radiation being released into the air. Fish and other sea creatures are unlikely to be seriously harmed by the radioactive leaks, even in the most contaminated areas. After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, fish in three freshwater lakes within the exclusion zone became contaminated with radioactive caesium but showed no obvious health problems, though some fish were born with reproductive abnormalities which may have been caused by radiation, said James Smith, an environmental physicist at Portsmouth University who studied fish in the area. While fish accumulate radioactive contamination, this happens less in the ion-rich waters of the oceans than in freshwater lakes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/nov/05/plebgate-mps-demand-apology-from-officers-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-05T17:08:07Z","webTitle":"Plebgate - MPs demand apology from officers: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/05/plebgate-mps-demand-apology-from-officers-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/nov/05/plebgate-mps-demand-apology-from-officers-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Plebgate - MPs demand apology from officers: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Keith Vaz, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, has said he is disappointed that the two Police Federation officers who were recalled to his committee this afternoon did not offer a full apology to Andrew Mitchell. (See 4.13pm.) Vaz told BBC News that the two were recalled because his committee felt they committed a contempt of parliament by misleading it two weeks ago. He welcomed the fact that Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones apologised in this respect. In Mr Hinton's case he was very open and transparent and gave us that apology. Mr Jones apologised if he had misled us and, as we believed he had misled us, we accept that apology. But I'm disappointed they did not take the opportunity to we gave them to be unequivocal in their apology to Mr Mitchell and his family. Vaz also said that Mitchell's wife was present in the room as the committee took evidence. The Independent Police Complaints Commission told the committee that its new inquiry into the Police Federation officers accused of giving a misleading account of their meeting with Mitchell to discuss plebgate will be finished by Christmas. A very experienced senior investigator, who is not a former police officer, is in charge of the inquiry, the MPs were told. • Ministers have started to offer concessions on the lobbying bill ahead of a vote on Tuesday afternoon that might lead to proposals for a three-month pause in the bill's scrutiny and reference of the regulation of charities at election times to a special select committee. As Patrick Wintour reports, Lord Wallace, the minister handling the bill, has written to coalition peers saying he is willing to raise the threshold substantially to ensure smaller charities are not covered by the bill's provisions that restrict the campaigning activity of charities during an election period. Ministers have also proposed that scrutiny of the section of the bill addressing charity campaigning could be deferred as long as six weeks, so long as the rest of the bill continued as normal. • The British ambassador in Berlin has been called in for a meeting at the German foreign ministry to explain allegations that Britain has set up a spying operation in its embassy building. • Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, has said that more work needs to be done to establish the possible economic benefits of the HS2 high-speed rail project. Speaking after an evidence-gathering session, Tryie said: KPMG acknowledged today that their £15 billion per annum forecast return for the project has no firm statistical foundation. A lot more work is clearly needed. • The Fire Brigades Union has said that firefighters in England and Wales will stage a fresh strike on 13 November in their row with the government over pensions.That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Keith Vaz is talking about the hearing on BBC News now. He says Stuart Hinton was open and transparent. Chris Jones only apologised on the basis that he might have misled the committee, Vaz says. But he says he was disappointed they did not offer a full apology to Andrew Mitchell. Here are the main points from the session. • The two Police Federation officers recalled to the committee refused again to apologise to Andrew Mitchell for what they said about him after their meeting with him to discuss the plebgate affair last October. There are have claims that they misrepresented what he said for political reasons, and that their inaccurate claim that he refused to elaborate on what happened at the gates of Downing Street contributed to his decision to resign as chief whip. The officers have already issued a partial apology, accepting that it was a mistake to speak to the media. But they have not accepted that they lied about the meeting, and they maintained that position today. \"I cannot apologise for something I haven't done,\" Sergeant Chris Jones said today. Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton said the same. • But the two officers expressed \"regret\" for the \"distress\" suffered by Mitchell. After the hearing two weeks ago they were criticised for not being sympathetic to Mitchell's situation. (See 2.41pm.) Today Hinton read out a statement on behalf of himself, Jone and Ken MacKaill (the third Police Federation officer who met Mitchell). Hinton said: Our position in so far as the meeting with Mr Mitchell is concerned hasn't changed. While the committee appears to believe that we are indifferent to Mr Mitchell's predicament and the distress caused to him and his family since the original incident in Downing Street. We are not, I am not. Each of us fully recognises and regrets that fact that such distress has been caused. We share the belief that the investigation into the original incident in Downing Street has already taken a disproportionate period of time and should be resolved in the interests of all parties without delay. Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, seemed to interpret this as a personal apology to Mitchell (when he asked a leading question about whether Hinton was apologising, Hinton said he was, for the distressed caused), whereas Vaz got Jones to say that Jones was not apologising to Mitchell. But Hinton and Jones were both essentially adopting the same position - expressing general regret for what happened to Mitchell, but not apologising for wrongdoing in this regard. • Hinton apologised to the committee for wrongly saying he had not referred to Theresa May as \"this woman\" in his conversation with Mitchell. (See 2.41pm.)And he apologised to May. I inadvertently gave an inaccurate answer to the committee on the 23 October. There was no intention to mislead the committee. I repeat my unqualified apology to the committee for this inaccuracy. I also repeat the unequivocal apology I made in writing as part of that same document to the home secretary. Whilst I believe that at the relevant point of the meeting on the 12 October [2012] I appear to have failed to bring the home secretary's name to mind, I fully accept that this does not excuse the form of expression I used in the meeting with Mr Mitchell and I apologise for that accordingly. • Jones told the committee that he did not mean to mislead the committee when he answered a question about his disciplinary record two weeks ago (see 2.41pm), but he said that he apologised if he misunderstood the question. It will be seen that on a proper analysis I do not believe that my answers misled the committee. My interpretation of the meaning of the questions has not changed. If, however, I failed to recognise the meaning of the questions I was asked, I apologise. If the committee was misled by my answers, then that was wholly unintentional. Do those amount to new apologies or not? Both men backed down over the allegation that they misled the committee two weeks ago. (See 2.41pm.) Stuart Hinton apologised clearly. Chris Jones was less apologetic, but he has written a letter to the committee, and there may be an apology in that. But the MPs on the committee are much more interested in a wider point - getting them to apologise to Andrew Mitchell for what happened to him. On this, the two officers gave ground a little. They said they regretted giving the impression that they did not care about the distress caused to Mitchell. But this seemed to be a reference to the distress caused to Mitchell by the plebgate affair generally. (Remember, these officers had nothing to do with the incident in Downing Street.) As for what they said themselves after their meeting with Mitchell, they do not accept that they deliberately misrepresented what he told them. And so, on that point, they would not apologise. Jones was more explicit about this (not apologising) than Hinton, although, as far as I could tell, both men were adopting the same position. I'll post a full summary soon. Labour's David Winnick asks Jones if he is absolutely sure that he has given the committee the information it wants. Jones says he has. And that's it. The session is over. Jones says it was not his intention to mislead the committee two weeks ago. But he misunderstood the question he was asked. If he mislead the committee because he misunderstood the question, he apologises, he says. Q: You have now given the committee all the information it requires. Jones says he would like to think so. Q: What is your disciplinary record? Jones says he has no findings of misconduct against him. But 13 complaints have been made against him. Vaz reads out what Jones's chief constable told the committee. (See 2.41pm) He says that in two cases action was taken. Jones says the action in relation to those complaints consisted of being given advice. That is not the same as a finding of misconduct. Q: What were those cases about? One was about the use of force, Jones says. The other was performance of duty. Q: What was that about? Jones says he was asked to secure a video. But when the video was opened, the wrong video was in the case. And Jones was criticsed for not checking the right video was in the case. Q: And the use of force issue? Jones says he pushed someone in the back when off duty, resulting in a minor injury to their mouth. Jones says he has submitted a written response to the committee. He is \"disappointed\" that he was not given a chance to respond to the committee before it published its report. It was not his intention to mislead the committee, he says. He says he \"adopts\" Hinton's evidence. Vaz says this is not America. A witness cannot \"adopt\"s someone else's evidence. Jones says he regrets what happened to Mitchell. Q: Will you apologise to Mitchell? Jones says he cannot apologise for something he has not done. But he recognises the distress that has been caused to Mitchell's family. He thinks it would be best if the investigation concludes quickly. Q: So you won't apologise for the distress caused? Jones says he cannot apologise for something he did not do. Q: You don't want to apologise for any distress? At the moment, says Jones. Chris Jones is now giving evidence. Vaz starts by repeating what he said to Hinton. Q: What do you want to say to the committee. Jones says he also has a written statement. Q: Have you any more to say? Hinton says he wants to say something on behalf of all three officers. They gave the impression they were unconcerned about Andrew Mitchell. That is not the case, he says. Q: So do you wish to apologise to Mr Mitchell and his family for the distress caused. For the distress caused, Hinton says. But he says he cannot apologise for something he did not do. Q: Is there anything else you want to say? No, says Hinton. Vaz says the committee has received a letter from Hinton's chief constable. The chief constable said it was a disrespectful term and that he would take this up with Hinton. Q: Has he done so? Not yet. Hinton says, again, it was an inadvertent error. Hinton is reading out his prepared statement. He says there were \"inadvertent inaccuracies\" in his evidence two weeks ago. He told the committee he did not remember saying \"this woman\" or \"that woman\". He had not listened to the tape for many months at the time. The transcript did not seem to make sense. Since the hearing, he has listened to the recording. He did say \"this woman\". And he was clearly referring to the home secretary. There was no intention to mislead the committee, he says. He apologises to the committee for that. And he says he wants to repeat the apology he offered in his letter to the committee to Theresa May. Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, starts. He thinks Hinton for coming. He says today's hearing will not cover what happened when Hinton met Andrew Mitchell. That is now being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Instead, the hearing will cover what Hinton said at the hearing two weeks ago. (See 2.41pm.) If the committee is not satisfied with what Hinton says, it will report to the Commons, and the Commons will report the matter to the privileges committee. Q: I asked you about the comments in the transcript where you referred to \"this woman\". I said three times that this was a reference to Theresa May. You said it was a \"typo\". (Vaz is spinning this question out at quite some length.) Q: [Still the same question]. In your letter to us you confirmed you were referring to May. Can you confirm that? Hinton says he has a statement to read out. The session is about to start. Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton is giving evidence first. And here are Guardian profiles of the Police Federation officers. The Commons home affairs committee is soon going to take evidence from two of the Police Federation officers who have been criticised for giving a misleading account of their conversation when they met him to discuss the plebgate affair. They are Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton from Warwickshire Police Federation and Sergeant Chris Jones from West Midlands Police Federatsion This is what happened last time they appeared before the committee (with a third Police Federation officer, Ken MacKaill from West Mercia Police Federation). In a report at the weekend, the home affairs committee strongly criticised all three officers for refusing to give a full apology to Mitchell for what happened. We are appalled at the stubborn and unashamed refusal of an apology by Inspector MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Hinton, and Sergeant Jones to Mr Mitchell. The only remorse shown by the three officers is that relating to the choreography of their dealings with the media after the meeting. Their statement of the 21 October 2013, which they continued to adhere to during their evidence, apologises for the \"poor judgement in talking to the media following the meeting\" on the 12 October 2013. We believe this is an empty gesture of little comfort to Mr Mitchell and his family. No matter what their view on the case, we find it incredible that they cannot recognise the impact their actions have had on another person's personal life and career. But, although Hinton and Jones have been recalled today so they can apologise to the committee, Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, is not necessarily expecting a new apology for what they said about Mitchell. The two men have been recalled to apologise for misleading the committee two weeks ago in relation to specific elements in their evidence. The case against Stuart Hinton This is what the report said about Hinton, and why he was being recalled. (The bold is from the original report.) We also note that, despite accepting the transcript as having been a correct recording of the meeting, when DS Hinton was asked about his use of the phrase \"we as you know as a federation have issues with the reform of this woman that the Conservative Party have\", he claimed to have been misquoted and stated that he believed it to be a typographical error. In the opinion of his own Chief Constable, \"It is clear that the phrase \"that woman\" was a reference to the Home Secretary and this is quite obviously a disrespectful term which should not have been used by anyone, particularly a serving police officer.\" We find it extraordinary that any witness, let alone a Chief Constable, should seek to correct the evidence given by another, particularly when that witness is a sworn officer, and given the nature of the investigation on which this inquiry focuses. The letter also specifically draws into question the integrity of the evidence provided by DS Hinton and states that his answers may have been \"adversely affected by his mistaken belief that he may face a misconduct panel at some future time\". We are appalled at the assertion that DS Hinton misled this Committee because of his belief that he could face a misconduct panel. All evidence given to select committees should be provided honestly and not be affected by forethoughts of any future outcome. It is an indictment of the quality of evidence provided by DS Hinton that, when specifically asked if the reference to \"this woman that the Conservative Party have\" was about the Home Secretary, he suggested that it was \"a typo, to be perfectly honest\". This can only be characterised as mendacious when subsequently he has informed us in a letter that he accepts that \"the woman referred to in this sentence must be the Home Secretary. No discourtesy or lack of respect was intended in referring to her in this way. I offer an unqualified apology to her through your Committee if the transcript appears to suggest either. Having listened to the recording—I do not claim to have a positive memory of the precise circumstances over a year later—my interpretation is that I was somewhat uncertain in what I was seeking to say at this point, and appear to have failed to bring immediately to mind the Home Secretary's name.\" It is a serious matter to mislead a Committee of this House and DS Hinton will be recalled to the Committee to apologise for this. If he fails to apologise, that would constitute a prima facie contempt of the House. We are referring DS Hinton to the IPCC. The case against Chris Jones And this is what the report said about Jones, and why he was being recalled. We asked explicitly whether any of the officers concerned had been disciplined for misconduct on a previous occasion. Inspector MacKaill stated he had been previously disciplined for misconduct. We are still awaiting details of the case. At the time that Inspector MacKaill clarified his disciplinary record for the Committee, the other witnesses were also invited to do so and both indicated that they had not been subject to disciplinary procedures. However, On 30 October, we received correspondence from Chief Constable Sims which stated that Sergeant Jones has been the subject of 13 complaints (including the current one): \"two were subject of a local resolution with the complainant, three were closed by dispensation, five were unsubstantiated and two resulted in action being taken\". Chief Constable Sims suggests that it seemed likely that the officers may have misunderstood the question as it was put to them in Committee. However, since the Committee returned to the question at the end of the officers' evidence, and Inspector MacKaill offered a clarification about a disciplinary matter some years ago, we do not believe that Sergeant Jones could have failed to recognise the question that was being asked. Sergeant Jones failed to give a full account of his disciplinary record when asked. It is a serious matter to mislead a Committee of this House and Sergeant Jones will be recalled to the Committee to apologise for this. If he fails to apologise, that would constitute a prima facie contempt of the House. The government is about to announce some new concessions on the lobbying bill, ahead of a vote this afternoon on a proposal to shelve it for three months. Lord Wallace of Saltaire, a government whip, has sent peers a letter saying this: We have listened to the views of many charities and other voluntary groups. They have made the point that low level and low spend campaigning, particularly by small groups, could be caught by the bill as currently drafted, and could mean that many more of them will have to register with the Electoral Commission and be subject to spending and donations controls in the run up to a general election. We understand these concerns and intend to respond to them. While the government stands by the principle - endorsed by the Electoral Commission and the Charity Commission - that third parties who campaign in a way which \"can reasonably be regarded as intended to promote or procure electoral success\" of a party or candidates should register with the Electoral Commission, we accept that there is a balance to be struck between transparency and placing regulatory requirements on third parties. We are therefore looking again at the thresholds for registration to ensure that small campaigning groups, including charities, are not caught by the regulatory regime. I will make clear to the House this afternoon that the government will bring forward amendments to the bill to substantially raise these thresholds from those proposed in the bill. • Ed Miliband has launched a sweeping attack on the government's approach to the economy, citing the development of a \"Wonga\" culture as evidence that Tory policies are failing to help people with the cost of living. \"The first and last test of economic policy is whether living standards for ordinary families are rising,\" he said in the speech, in which he also confirmed plans to give firms that pay the living wage a 12-month tax break. See 12.19pm for a full summary. The Tories accused him of being \"opportunist\". Sajid Javid, the Treasury minister, put out this statement. We want to secure a sustainable, long-term economic recovery for hardworking people. That means we must stick to our economic plan - growing the economy, helping business create jobs and cutting the deficit. And by controlling spending to cut the deficit, we can keep mortgage rates low and taxes low. Already we have cut income tax for 25 million people, frozen council tax and frozen fuel duty. But Labour's same old policy of more spending, more borrowing and more debt - exactly what got us into a mess in the first place - would mean higher taxes and higher mortgage rates. Even Ed Balls says Ed Miliband's latest policy would have a 'substantial extra cost'. Hardworking people would be worse off with Ed Miliband's short-termist, opportunistic politics. • Miliband has refused calls to reopen Labour's inquiry into alleged vote-rigging in Falkirk. • Boris Johnson has blamed rising energy prices on Labour's failure to build more nuclear power stations. This is what he said on LBC. The answer to our energy crisis is to build more generation. It is absolutely crazy, we spent 20 years creating a load of blooming wind farms that wouldn't pull the skin off a rice pudding and produce a tiny quantity of our energy needs. We should have started 20 years ago with the nuclear stuff. It's a disaster that we didn't. Labour pussy-footed around for ages out of sheer neuralgia about nuclear. We should have gone for it then and we should go for it now. I'm afraid that what Labour is endlessly trying to say, that you can have your cake and eat it and you can somehow cut fuel bills and get the energy companies to disgorge all this money without jeopardising their ability to invest in new plant - that strikes me intuitively as being wrong. • Johnson has sharply criticised the regime to control terrorism suspects and claimed that Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who has gone missing after disguising himself in a burqa, \"obviously had help to escape\". As Alan Travis reports, the London mayor blamed \"coalition politics\" for watering down the previous regime of control orders and claimed the current terrorism prevention and investigation measures or \"Tpims\" were not working. He urged the home secretary, Theresa May, to \"get tough\" with the Liberal Democrats to end the \"ludicrous\" situation. It is worth remembering that May is a potential rival to Johnson in a future Tory leadership contest. This is what Quentin Letts wrote in a revealing profile of May earlier this year. Earlier this year, when there was speculation about David Cameron’s future and the Mayor of London started making mischief, Mrs May laid down markers that she would fight for the Tory leadership if there was a vacancy ... Mr Cameron was initially peeved by such naked jockeying for position but there has since been a rapprochement. Mrs May has let it be known she is not hoping to oust Mr Cameron: she is simply determined that Boris Johnson should not stroll into high office. I am told she finds his shallowness childish and his repeated adultery deplorable. It affronts her both as a child of the vicarage and as a woman. She has no time for Boris’s fnarr-fnarr celebrity. Johnson has also today admitted riding his bike at night without a working back light. • Payday lenders are divided over a plan to limit the number of rollovers of short-term, high-interest loans, MPs have heard. • Lone mothers and their children have lost their legal challenge to the government's flagship benefit cap policy. As the Press Association reports, two high court judges ruled on Tuesday that new capping regulations introduced by the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, are lawful. • Caroline Flint, the energy secretary, has said the energy bosses of all the major energy firms should follow the example of Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw and forgo their bonuses. • The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said that the UK is one of best places to live and work, although income inequality has risen by more than in other countries since the global financial crisis struck in 2007. • Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has said that David Cameron's CBI speech yesterday showed that he will not have clout to win significant concessions from the EU in his renegotiation of its powers. How can the Prime Minister try to suggest to the general public that he is going to play hardball with Brussels and claw back actual, credible powers to Britain when he very publicly promises he wants to keep Britain in the EU? Why would any of the other 27 leaders or any of the power brokers of the EU be concerned for one minute that they should try to meet his demands when he is so dewy-eyed over the European project? They can see it for what it is. He says one thing to the public, and another to them. He changes his tune depending on his audience. The commission president was right when he said that only UKIP were the real Eurosceptics and that the Conservatives were just fakes, saying we would win more support in the 2014 European elections from an increasingly unhappy British public. He also pointed out that there could be no real repatriation of powers without a treaty change, and that that option was not on the table and never would be. Going into the supposed negotiations with a red line that says, 'whatever the EU does we will support it', is an extraordinary diplomatic strategy, and one doomed to fail. When David Cameron marches into these high powered meetings to talk tough and fight for British sovereignty, everyone around the table must be shaking with laughter, not fear. • The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said that the Somerset badger cull has failed to meet its target - even after the three-week extension. • Thousands of probation staff have started a 24-hour strike over government plans to privatise the service. In the Commons Julian Smith, the Conservative MP, has just used a point of order to raise allegations that UK intelligence officials may have been named in the leaked documents obtained by the Guardian from Edward Snowden and distributed overseas. His question was triggered by a New York Times story. This is what he said: The Guardian newspaper has constantly denied sending details of UK intelligence agents overseas ... Over this weekend the New York Times published highly specific information regarding UK intelligence teams operating in the Middle East. Is it in order, Mr Speaker, for a national newspaper to constantly refuse questions from this House and to threaten the security of our constituents in this way? John Bercow, the Speaker, said that this was not an issue of procedure (as Smith knew full well - he was just using the point of order mechanism to raise the matter on the floor of the Commons). Bercow went on: The honourable gentlemen is drawing attention to what he believes to be what I think I can probably best describe as an equivocation by the Guardian. That is a matter that the honourable gentleman must pursue by other means. He also said that Smith had already held a debate on the conduct of the Guardian in Westminster Hall, and he suggested that Smith could try for another debate on this matter. In the Commons George Osborne, the chancellor, has just announced that Britain has signed an information sharing agreement with the Cayman Islands. It's the first deal of its kind with an overseas territory, he said, and it meant HM Revenue and Customs would have access to information about money held in Cayman Islands accounts. One of Sparrow's rules of political journalism is that is often an inverse correlation between the newsworthiness of a speech and its quality. Today's speech from Ed Miliband is a good example. The main announcement in it, the tax break for firms that pay the living wage, or the \"make work pay\" contracts as Miliband calls them, came at the weekend and, in story terms, it's a bit thin. The comments about payday lenders may make the news, but one journalist at the event said on Twitter than Miliband did produce a story until he revealed in the Q&amp;A that he had recently spoken to his brother. Yet it's a very good speech because it tackles the Conservative charge that he is anti-market head-on and makes the case for market intervention in language that is clear and engaging (and relatively free of the usual bombast and hyperbole). Here are the main points. • Miliband mocked David Cameron for thinking the cost of living was not related to the state of the economy. Now, David Cameron said recently that I wanted to “talk about the cost of living” because I didn’t want to talk about “economic policy.” So we have a Prime Minister who thinks we can detach our national economic success from the success of Britain’s families and businesses. He doesn't seem to realise that there is no such thing as a successful economy which doesn't carry Britain’s families with it. And he obviously doesn't get that the old link between growth and living standards is just broken. • He said living standards, and whether they are rising, is the most important test of economic policy. The first and last test of economic policy is whether living standards for ordinary families are rising. • He said government had to \"permanently restore the link between growth and living standards for all of Britain’s working people\". • He accused the Conservatives of being ideologically committed to the economic model that led to people being on low wages. Listen to their silence on our plans for a living wage. Nothing to say. On the falling value of the minimum wage. Nothing to say. On zero-hours contracts. Nothing to say. On the exploitation of low-skill migrant labour which undercuts wages. Nothing to say. They’re silent because of what they believe in. In his speech to the Conservative Party Conference, George Osborne described my argument that they believed in a race to the bottom as something straight out of “Karl Marx” and “Das Kapital.” No. He’s wrong. It is about what is happening in this capital city. Right here. And towns and cities across the country. Right now. Now, they think that this low wage economy is the best we can do. Because they believe doing anything about it means intervening in markets in ways that we shouldn’t. • He said that David Cameron's willingness to defend energy companies meant that consumers were facing a \"Big Seven\" (Cameron and the \"Big Six\" energy firms). Labour was giving MPs a chance to vote on its plan for an energy bill freeze in an opposition day debate tomorrow, he said. • Miliband defended market intervention. All markets had rules, he said, and all governments, including the coalition, intervened in markets. The difference between Labour and the Tories was not about whether to intervene, but how to intervene, he said. A dynamic market economy, with profitable private sector companies is essential for creating the wealth we need. But markets always have rules. The question is: what do those rules allow? And what do they encourage? ... All governments set rules for what they want to see. This government does intervene in markets but in the wrong way. They make it easier to fire people. Water down rights for agency workers. Turn a blind eye to the failure to pay the minimum wage. Pushing companies to compete on low wages, low skills and worse terms and conditions. They introduce tax cuts for the richest. Defend bonuses for the bankers. Stand up for a powerful few. Supporting their belief that wealth will trickle down from those at the top to everybody else. Don’t believe it when they say they are stepping away, they are stepping in all the time, stepping in to stand up for the wrong people. • He described the rise of payday lenders like Wonga as \"one of the worst symbols\" of the cost of living crisis. Last night the boss of Wonga said he was speaking for the ‘silent majority’, who are happy with their service. But the truth is he wants us to stay silent about a company where in one year alone their bad debts reached £120 million. An industry in which seven out of ten customers said they regretted taking out a loan. With half saying they couldn’t pay it back. Payday lenders don’t speak for the silent majority. They are responsible for a quiet crisis of thousands of families trapped in unpayable debt. The Wonga economy is one of the worst symbols of this cost of living crisis. • He said that Labour would introduce \"make work pay\" contracts giving 12-month tax breaks to firms paying the living wage as soon as it was elected. • He accused Cameron of being more rightwing than former Conservative prime ministers Stanley Baldwin and John Major. This power station was built in the 1920s after a Conservative government intervened to fix a broken energy market. That government, of Stanley Baldwin, knew that if government didn’t fix broken markets, nobody else was going to. Stanley Baldwin knew it. John Major seems to understand it. But David Cameron doesn’t. His response to Labour’s energy price freeze shows how out of the mainstream he is. He took issue with the whole idea of government intervention in a broken market. • He said there was no need for Labour to reopen its inquiry into the alleged vote-rigging in Falkirk. He had responded to the allegations \"swiftly\", he said in the Q&amp;A. Mr Miliband said he believed Mr Darling meant \"that we should look at any new evidence\" and that had happened. He said that the local party was already in special measures and that he was bringing in fundamental changes to relations with the unions. \"I am absolutely determined that we do not have a repeat of Falkirk anywhere,\" he added. Here's the full text of Ed Miliband's speech. BBC News and Sky have abandoned their live coverage. But I've got the text, and I'll post a full summary of it soon. Miliband mocks David Cameron. David Cameron is still on his lap of honour. To celebrate how brilliantly he has done. In the slowest recovery for a hundred years. And he says the Tories think low wages are how Britain will compete with China. But Labour believes in a race to the top, he says. The coalition has intervened in markets in the wrong way, Miliband says. All governments set rules for what they want to see. This Government does intervene in markets but in the wrong way. They make it easier to fire people. Water down rights for agency workers. Turn a blind eye to the failure to pay the minimum wage. Pushing companies to compete on low wages, low skills and worse terms and conditions. They introduce tax cuts for the richest. Defend bonuses for the bankers. Stand up for a powerful few. Supporting their belief that wealth will trickle down from those at the top to everybody else. Don’t believe it when they say they are stepping away, they are stepping in all the time, stepping in to stand up for the wrong people. Miliband says he backs the market economy - but that there must be rules. A dynamic market economy, with profitable private sector companies is essential for creating the wealth we need. But markets always have rules. The question is: what do those rules allow? And what do they encourage? Do they encourage companies to create high-skill, high-wage jobs, as part of a race to the top? And provide the support they need to do so? Or do they encourage a race to the bottom of low wages and low skills? Do the rules mend broken markets? Or allow some firms to take advantage of broken markets at the expense of everybody else? Miliband says the Tories have nothing to say about issues like zero-hours contracts, and the falling value of the minimum wage, because they support this economic model. In his speech to the Conservative Party Conference, George Osborne described my argument that they believed in a race to the bottom as something straight out of “Karl Marx” and “Das Kapital.” Miliband jokes that his father might have liked this. He goes on: [Osborne's] wrong. It is about what is happening in this capital city. Right here. And towns and cities across the country. Right now. Now, they think that this low wage economy is the best we can do. Because they believe doing anything about it means intervening in markets in ways that we shouldn’t. I disagree. Miliband says the Tories do not undestand this problem. Now, David Cameron said recently that I wanted to “talk about the cost of living” because I didn’t want to talk about “economic policy.” So we have a Prime Minister who thinks we can detach our national economic success from the success of Britain’s families and businesses. He doesn't seem to realise that there is no such thing as a successful economy which doesn't carry Britain’s families with it. And he obviously doesn't get that the old link between growth and living standards is just broken. Growth without national prosperity is not economic success. The first and last test of economic policy is whether living standards for ordinary families are rising. And as I listened to these stories, my overwhelming thought was: how is this being allowed to happen in Britain, 2013? Because these stories of payday lenders are just one part of the cost of living crisis facing families across our country. Low skilled jobs. Wages that are stagnating. Predatory behaviour by some companies. This isn’t just an issue for the lowest paid, it affects the squeezed middle just as much. A country where a few at the top do well, but everybody else struggles. This is not just an issue facing Britain. It is the issue facing Britain. Miliband starts with stories about meeting two women who took out payday loans, and who then ended up with horrific debt problems. He met them at an advice centre. The woman in charge told him payday loan companies were running riot through the community. This is an industry where seven out of 10 customers say they regret taking out of a loan. Payday lenders are responsible for a quiet crisis of debt. The \"Wonga economy\" is one of the worst symptoms of the state of the economy, he says. Ed Miliband is about to give his speech. He is being introduced Rob Tincknell, the chief executive of Battersea power station. He says last Thursday marked the 30th anniversary of the closure of the power station. Battersea power station is used to hosting politicians, Tincknell says. That may be a reference to David Cameron, who launched the Conservative party's 2010 manifesto here. Ed Milband will be giving his speech on the cost of living at Battersea power station shortly. There is no live feed, so I will be dependent on BBC News and Sky. I'll post a summary when I've seen the full text. Before he starts, here's a short reading list. • Patrick Wintour's preview story for the Guardian. • The Independent on Sunday's interview with Miliband in which he announced his plan to offer a tax break to firms that pay the living wage. • An article in the Times on Monday (paywall) by John McTernan, Tony Blair's former political secretary, criticising the living wage proposal. Here's an extract. The dirty secret at the heart of the Living Wage concept is that it is a classic Trotskyist “transitional demand”. It is not intended to reform capitalism but to expose its contradictions. The value of the demand is that it appears reasonable but can never be met. That, comrade, is the point. Many decent people support this campaign. But they are wrong. Remember the arguments about the introduction of the National Minimum Wage? Employers feared that it would destroy jobs. In the end it didn’t. Not because the greedy plutocratic boss class were wrong, but because of careful design. The Labour Government created a Low Pay Commission to model the impact of a minimum wage. The level that was set was not arbitrary, but scientific. Hence, all gain, no pain. So what about the Living Wage? This has been modelled by the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Public Policy Research. Their conclusions? 300,000 young people would lose their jobs if it was implemented across Britain. Ah, but it wouldn’t be across the whole economy, I hear proponents say, just for firms who can afford it. Seriously? You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. The ConservativeHome website seems to be down at the moment. And here are four articles I found particularly interesting. • Steve Richards in the Independent says Ed Miliband may avoid a decision on whether or not to back an EU referendum until after the Scottish independence referendum. As I wrote recently, the Labour leader has been known to reflect that he could write Labour’s manifesto now. But he has one momentous decision still to make. Does he match Cameron’s offer on Europe, or fight an election without making such a pledge? At one point I was told that Miliband was ready to announce his support for a referendum before this year’s Labour conference. The latest thinking is that no final decision will be made until shortly before the European elections next summer, and possibly not until after the referendum in Scotland where Salmond would make much of both potential UK Prime Ministers risking the UK’s continued membership of the EU by offering a referendum. • Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) says politicians should be wary of extravagant promises. At this point, politicians and their advisers will make the electoral case against low-key manifestos: who would vote for a party that does not even hold out the hope of a much better country? But the ultimate victim of bombast and over-ambition is the good name of politics itself. If the defining flavour of British public life is nihilistic cynicism, it is partly the result of politicians making big promises while trends in the outside world degrade their capacity to deliver on them. In Westminster, people ask where the next truly national leader will come from; one who transcends the electoral stalemate that looks to be Britain’s medium-term destiny and commands a convincing governing majority. Pundits monitor the 2010 parliamentary intake for a nascent Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair. The folly is to assume that a winner must evince the boldness and sheer theatre of those two. There may be an untapped following for a more modest politics, for grown-up candour about what the government of any medium-sized country can do against globalisation and history, for practical policies to make life a bit but not much better. The next great leader might be more Angela Merkel than Thatcher, more Sir John Major than Mr Blair. As they prepare their manifestos for 2015, politicians should dare to be dull. • Graeme Leach in the Times (paywall) says the economy could be slowing down by the time of the 2015 election. Mr Osborne’s economic hopes face a pincer movement. Banking weakness will prevent escape velocity and if the economy grows in unbalanced ways — perhaps via the housing market — we may see the re-emergence of inflation. And if you think I’m being negative, I haven’t even mentioned the risk of the return of the euro crisis. The unfolding narrative at present is that, despite the Conservatives trailing in the polls, economic recovery will steadily lift them and allow David Cameron to tell voters that all the pain has been worthwhile. The broad economic consensus is that GDP growth will accelerate from around 1.5 per cent this year to 2 per cent in 2014 and 2.5 per cent in 2015. If this happens — and it might — the budget deficit will narrow sharply and the political deficit will move into surplus, providing a springboard for a possible Tory victory. The optimistic forecasts may come to pass, but many of the people making such forecasts didn’t predict the recovery in late 2012. They missed it because they didn’t pay sufficient attention to how the total amount of money in the economy — the M4x measure — began to grow about a year ago. Further acceleration of M4x in the first half of 2013, by around 5 per cent, happened only because of the lagged effects of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing policy. Without that QE the economy would have continued to bump along the bottom; now it has ended, its beneficial effects might end too. Sorry to be technical, but the one thing that stands out in the current economic debate is the lack of recognition of the role of money in the recovery. And if the economic consensus has failed to understand the past, it won’t predict the future accurately either. • Hamish Macdonell in the Times (paywall) says Sir John Major, the Conservative former prime minister, has said that the UK would be diminished if Scotland voted for independence - even though that result would benefit the Conservatives. Sir John — the last Conservative leader to win a general election outright, 21 years ago — said it was in Tory interests for Scotland to vote to break with the rest of the UK. He added that while independence might suit the Conservatives politically it would be a disaster for the United Kingdom. “Somewhere down the line we have mislaid our Scottish votes,” he said. “From a purely political point of view we would be better off without Scotland, but the UK would not. “If Scotland went, the UK would be diminished. Heaven knows what we would do for an Army without Scotland. And there is a huge amount of Scottish talent.” The Telegraph's Michael Deacon is at Battersea power station for Ed Miliband's speech. He has been inspired to start quoting Morrissey. For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 40% (down 1 from YouGov in the Sunday Times) Conservatives: 33% (up 1) Ukip: 12% (no change) Lib Dems: 9% (up 1) Labour lead: 7 points (down 2) Government approval: -27 According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 90. And Keith Vaz, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, has been on TV this morning too. Talking about the plebgate hearing this afternoon, he said that his committee would be giving the two Police Federation officers a \"big opportunity\" to correct what they said when they gave evidence to the committee last month. It’s only two weeks since the officers came to see the select committee to give us their version of events and I’m sorry to say that in a number of respects they have given evidence that was not strictly accurate. So this is their big opportunity today to come before the committee and to explain why that happened and to correct the record. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy minister, has been giving interviews this morning. As Patrick Wintour reports, she said that the bosses of major energy firms should follow the example of Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw and give up their bonuses. She also said that Labour would not be publishing its internal report into the alleged vote-rigging in Falkirk. Wonga and other payday lenders are giving evidence to the Commons business committee now. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering it on his business live blog. Asked on LBC how much his energy bill, Johnson was unable to answer. \"I'm sure it's outrageous\" was all he could say. He said that that \"higher powers\" in his house (Mrs Johnson, presumably) dealt with these matters. On his LBC show Boris Johnson has just taken a question on Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, the terror suspect who absconded last week from a Tpim dressed in a burqa. Johnson said the incident showed that the Tpim system was \"plainly not working\" in the way that it should. He said that he suspected that Mohamed had an accomplice, but he stressed that he did not know this for sure. When LBC's Nick Ferrari asked him if he had asked the police for clarification on this, he started floundering (making it clear that he hadn't). Johnson also said that banning the burqa (as some Tory MPs proposed yesterday) would be \"ludicrous\". The practice of placing offenders in the stocks and pelting them with rotten fruit has long been abandoned, but Commons select committees are thriving and today we're likely to see Keith Vaz and his colleagues on the home affairs committee treating two officers from the Police Federation in a manner reminiscent of the day when people were literally pilloried, and not just metaphorically. If you want to know why the committee feels so strongly, read the report it published at the weekend. That's this afternoon. Before that I will be focusing on Ed Miliband's cost of living speech. Here's the agenda for the day. 9am: Boris Johnson hosts his Ask Boris phone-in on LBC. 9.30am: The Commons Treasury committee takes evidence from economists on HS2. 10am: Single parents learn the outcome of their legal challenge to the government's benefit cap policy. 10.15am: Wonga and others give evidence to the Commons business committee about payday loan companies. 11am: Ed Miliband delivers a speech on the cost of living crisis at Battersea power station. As Patrick Wintour reports, Miliband will declare the cost of living crisis has become the preeminent issue facing Britain, as he sets out plans for employers to receive a tax rebate if they choose to pay a worker the living wage, which is now worth £7.65 an hour, £1.34 higher than the minimum wage. 11.30am: George Osborne, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12.30pm: Nick Clegg hosts a Q&amp;A with youngsters at a careers fair. 2pm: Peter Horrocks, director of the BBC World Service, gives evidence to the foreign affairs committee. 2pm: Ofgem holds a conference on re-engaging consumers in the energy market. 2pm: Sir David Nicholson, the NHS England chief executive, gives evidence to the Commons health committee. 2.45pm: Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton from Warwickshire Police Federation gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. At 3pm Sergeant Chris Jones from West Midlands Police Federation gives evidence. From 3pm: Peers begin a debate on the lobbying bill. At some point there may be a vote on an attempt to delay the bill for three months. 4pm: Dame Anne Owers, chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and Rachel Cerfontyne, the IPCC deputy chair, give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the “plebgate” affair As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary at around 1pm and another after the home affairs committee hearing.

Heavy rain and strong winds during 2010 meant that renewables - principally hydro, wind and solar power - met 35% of Spanish demand. Wind power rose by 18.5% in 2010 and now meets 16% of demand. Luis Atienza, managing director of Spain's electricity grid, predicted that \"within three years wind power will overtake nuclear as an electricity source\". At its peak, on November 9, wind power met 43% of demand. Heavy rains saw hydro-electrical production rise by 59% on 2009. Solar power, meanwhile, lags behind at only 3%, although some of the big solar plants have yet to come on stream. Oil and gas continue to generate about half of Spain's capacity, while nuclear power accounts for around 19%. Javier Garcîa Breva, director of the solar energy programme, said that \"even five years ago no one would have believed these figures were possible. No one expected renewables to grow so fast. They have unlimited potential.\" Spain continues to import electricity from France but only as a staging post en route to Morocco, Portugal and Andorra. \"France has not increased its capacity and so its ability to export has decreased,\" Atienza said. \"This has fallen further due to industrial strife.\" During recent strikes dozens of French power stations were forced to close and Spanish production had to be imported to meet the shortfall. This greening of the Spanish grid has not benefited the consumer, with prices likely to rise by 9% in 2011. The government sets electricity prices which have no direct correlation with production costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2008/sep/11/scotland.labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-11T15:56:23Z","webTitle":"Scottish Labour goes nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/11/scotland.labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/11/scotland.labour","fields":{"headline":"Scotland's nuclear power struggle","bodyText":"It's the ultra-modish way of getting greenie points in 2008: the energy saving bulb giveaway. The Sun is one wot's done it; so too has British Gas and now Alex Salmond has joined in. The first minister will be in Edinburgh this evening helping Scottish Hydro Electric and Mecca bingo give away 2m free energy-saving bulbs, before he bounds onto the bingo hall stage to call out the numbers. It's a savvy stunt: Scotland's president-in-waiting as MC Salmond, distributing largesse. The timing is cute. Today Gordon Brown's team has unveiled its rather grander green energy initiative, offering £1bn in energy-saving grants and tripling the winter fuel allowance. So another salvo in the energy war between the SNP and Labour has been fired. Energy – where to get it; who makes it and how green it is – is emerging as a crucial battleground between the two parties and the two governments. And, slowly emerging at the centre of that debate, is nuclear power and the SNP's emblematic opposition to any new nuclear power plants in Scotland. It must be one of the least obvious battlegrounds when you're fighting for votes in one of most left-of-centre electorates in Europe. Yet Labour strategists believe that nuclear is a significant weak spot for the Nats. Over the last few weeks, there has been a slow but deliberate cranking up of the nuclear debate in Scotland – with the blessing and influence of Labour and Downing Street behind it. The pro-nuclear lobby bounced into the debate with the SNP's recent energy consultation. Business groups such as CBI Scotland warn that the SNP is risking the country's energy security – its independence if you like – by refusing to replace the Hunterston and Torness reactors when they are retired by 2016 and 2023. As with opposing nuclear weapons on the Clyde, for the SNP this is a central article of faith, as it is for large swaths of the left in Scotland – including a good few Labour MSPs at Holyrood. The scandal of the radioactive waste dumped and discharged at Dounreay, the spectre of a secretive elite dictating energy policy from the 1950s onwards, the anxieties over cancer clusters around power plants, pollution from Sellafield, are all engraved on nationalist consciousness. So for Salmond, opposing nuclear power is an easy win. Opinion polls suggest Scots oppose nukes by at least 6-4. Bolt onto that the bold and (hope the SNP) inspiring ambition that Scotland could become the \"Saudi Arabia\" of renewable energy, and it all sounds great. Another big leap towards creating Shangri-La. But Labour will be making the more complex and riskier argument that Scotland cannot survive without more nukes; like it or lump it. Here's a coincidence: two of Scottish Labour's leadership candidates – Iain Grey in East Lothian and Andy Kerr in East Kilbride - happen to represent constituencies with strong nuclear interests: Grey with Torness and Kerr the headquarters of British Energy. Labour strategists believe being anti-nuke makes these easy seats to defend against the SNP but insiders also insist their pro-nuclear stance is also rational, logical and – when put the \"right\" way – popular. Put crudely, it runs like this: the traditional arguments against nuclear power are outdated and stale. Opposition is emotional not rational. The nukes of the 60s and 70s are not 21st century nukes – the next generation are now far cleaner, cheaper, simpler and off-the-shelf. The overwhelming need to find reliable non-carbon sources of energy to combat rising CO2 levels, the increasing anxiety around energy security with our over-reliance on volatile Russian gas, surging world energy prices and the need for a constant supply of base load electricity supply, makes the argument for new nukes compelling. So says Labour, the CBI, the Tories and others. And yesterday, Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald fired Labour's first salvo. He said it was \"bizarre\" for SNP energy minister Jim Mather to state that the Scottish government's rush for green energy (generating 50% of all electricity from renewables by 2020) was first and foremost to rid Scotland of nuclear power. \"Even those who share their scepticism about nuclear power will be astonished that they believe 'migrating from nuclear' is a higher priority than carbon savings, affordability or security of supply,\" he claimed. But this is still a tough argument to sell in Scotland, not least when Salmond has shown his typical skill in apparently capturing the moral high ground – bloody great chunks of it. \"The problem we've got is we've allowed Salmond to frame this debate as if you're either for renewables or against,\" said senior Labour figure. \"I'm neither. I'm pro-electricity.\" He recalled one poll that found last year that while 60% of Scots were anti-nuke also showed that \"flipped over\" so that 60% became pro-nuke if the question was different: what about nuclear power if it stops us relying on the Russians? But wouldn't this be much easier if Brown's government wasn't so vulnerable on other areas of energy policy – grindingly slow on renewables; slow to respond to the fuel price crisis (goodbye Glasgow East); and under attack over the windfall tax? Then take another SNP complaint: the refusal of the energy regulator and UK ministers to deeply cut the costs of transmitting \"green\" electricity from the Highlands and Islands to the south. Salmond converts this into proof that London is deliberately sabotaging Scotland's green economy. He and his ministers are merrily talking of ersatz energy-connection deals with the Irish and Norwegians instead; talking of North Sea \"grids\" to bypass the English. So, if Labour does want to win the energy argument, why does it keep handing the SNP the bullets to fire?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/28/deadly-tornadoes-hit-southern-us","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-28T15:40:00Z","webTitle":"Hundreds dead as tornadoes rip through southern US states","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/28/deadly-tornadoes-hit-southern-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/28/deadly-tornadoes-hit-southern-us","fields":{"headline":"Hundreds dead as tornadoes rip through southern US states","bodyText":"Tornadoes and violent storms have ripped through seven southern US states, killing more than 220 people as they flattened neighbourhoods, overturned cars and toppled trees and power lines. In the deadliest series of tornadoes the US has seen in nearly four decades, 131 people were killed in Alabama alone. The Alabama governor, Robert Bentley, said the state had suffered \"massive destruction of property\" and warned the death toll was likely to rise. Fifteen people died in Tuscaloosa, a city of 93,000 and home to the University of Alabama. Sections of the city were destroyed and the city's infrastructure devastated, the mayor said. State officials reported 32 people killed in Mississippi, 30 in Tennessee, 11 in Arkansas, 10 in Georgia, eight in Virginia and two in Louisiana. The clusters of powerful tornadoes – more than 100 in total – combined with storms to cut a swath of destruction from west to east over several days. The Browns Ferry nuclear power plant in Alabama was expected to be shut for days or weeks as workers repaired damaged transmission lines. Up to a million people in Alabama were left without power. In Tuscaloosa news footage showed paramedics lifting a child out of a flattened home and many neighbouring buildings reduced to rubble. A hospital said its emergency room had admitted about 100 people and treated 400. \"What we faced today was massive damage on a scale we have not seen in Tuscaloosa in quite some time,\" the mayor, Walter Maddox, told reporters, adding that he expected his city's death toll to rise. \"This could be the worst tornado in Alabama's history,\" said meteorologist Josh Nagelberg of AccuWeather.com. Hardest hit was Birmingham, Alabama's biggest city, where at least 26 people were confirmed dead as of late Wednesday. There were 13 in Walker county and 11 in Jefferson county, including a child whose parents were missing, as well as two in St Clair county. The severe weather started at about 5.30am with winds of up to 100 miles an hour ripping through parts of the city, toppling trees and knocking out power. By nightfall power was out to 370,000 customers statewide and more than 170,000 in the Birmingham metropolitan area. Forecasters had been warning of the storms for days, so schools were shut and many took the day off work to watch tornadoes live on television. Barack Obama said he had spoken to Bentley and approved his request for emergency federal assistance such as search and rescue. \"Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected by this devastation and we commend the heroic efforts of those who have been working tirelessly to respond to this disaster,\" Obama said. Around Tuscaloosa traffic was hampered by fallen trees and power lines. Some drivers abandoned their cars. Maddox said authorities were having trouble communicating with each other as 1,400 national guard soldiers were deployed around the state. The flashing lights of emergency vehicles could be seen on darkened streets all over town and some were using winches to remove overturned vehicles from the side of the road. In Huntsville meteorologists found themselves in the path of a tornado and had to evacuate the national weather service office. In Mississippi a police officer was killed when a tree fell on to his tent as he shielded his young daughter with his body, said Kim Korthuis, a national parks ranger. The girl was not hurt. In eastern Tennessee a woman was killed by falling trees in her trailer in Chattanooga. Just outside the city, in Tiftonia, what appeared to be a tornado struck at the base of the tourist peak Lookout Mountain. Tops were snapped off trees and insulation and metal roof panels littered the ground."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-lessons-missed-research-gaps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-26T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl lessons missed because of research gaps, says radiation expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-lessons-missed-research-gaps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-lessons-missed-research-gaps","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl lessons missed because of research gaps, says radiation expert","bodyText":"The long-term health effects of Chernobyl remain unclear 25 years after the most serious nuclear accident in history, according to a former World Health Organisation (WHO) official. A full assessment of the public health impact has been thwarted by poorly co-ordinated research on residents in areas close to the plant, and should be carried out with funding from the European commission, said Keith Baverstock, a former health and radiation adviser to the WHO. He said research had been frustrated by pro- and anti-nuclear lobby groups who had turned the debate over health risks into a battleground. Crucial lessons on how to respond to nuclear emergencies and quell public anxiety had been missed by governments and authorities such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In an editorial in the British Medical Journal to mark the anniversary of the disaster, Baverstock calls for comprehensive research into cancers, birth defects and other health problems among 600,000 people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. \"Much could still be learnt and 'no evidence of health damage' after comprehensive investigation would be a valuable result,\" he writes. The project should be funded by the European commission and would cost €10m (£8.8m) for the first 10 years, Baverstock told the Guardian. A similar programme is under way to monitor the health of survivors of the nuclear bomb attacks on Japan in 1945. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded and caught fire on 26 April 1986, blasting vast quantities of radioactive material into the atmosphere where it drifted across European borders. Health restrictions are still in place at some UK farms after radioactive caesium from the plant blew over and contaminated pastureland. The incident is thought to have caused 6,000 extra cases of thyroid cancer in people who were children at the time. Inaction by the Soviet authorities meant there was no ban on milk and other foodstuffs contaminated with radioactive iodine, which is now known to cause the cancer. In Japan, officials took swift action after the Fukushima power plant leaked radiation last month, distributing protective iodine pills to local residents. The spread of radioactive material across Europe in 1986 led to widespread chaos as food bans were introduced in some countries and not others, and governments issued conflicting travel advice, a run of events now playing out in Japan, said Baverstock, who is now based at the University of Eastern Finland. \"Although information abounds, little of it is usable, especially in terms of determining the potential effect on public health, and its truthfulness is doubtful,\" the editorial states. In the first days of the Fukushima crisis, the engagement of both the WHO and IAEA \"was notable by its absence\", a situation Baverstock describes as \"institutional failure\". After Chernobyl, the WHO set up a nuclear emergency project office to co-ordinate its response to future nuclear accidents, but the office was closed in 2000. Baverstock argues that the health implications of Chernobyl have become a battleground for pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies that \"seek to interpret the effects or absence of effects to their own advantage and are apparently unwilling to find the truth\". \"Apart from exacerbating the psychosocial effects on those directly affected, this situation has prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the importance of the event to public health,\" he writes. Geraldine Thomas, director of the Chernobyl tissue bank at Imperial College, London, said lifespan studies that monitor the health of people around Chernobyl would be valuable, if only to prove there were no other long-term consequences from the accident. But she said putting too much emphasis on questions that may never be answered could raise unnecessary fears. \"Telling a whole population that it may have health consequences at some point in its lifetime is not good for that population psychologically and we possibly do more harm than good in this respect,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/jan/23/sellafield-nuclear-gordon-brown","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-23T16:31:00Z","webTitle":"Brown backs plans for new Sellafield nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/23/sellafield-nuclear-gordon-brown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/jan/23/sellafield-nuclear-gordon-brown","fields":{"headline":"Brown backs plans for new Sellafield nuclear power station","bodyText":"Gordon Brown today welcomed proposals for a new nuclear power station at Sellafield as he made a visit to the site. The prime minister's trip to the site came after the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) announced its willingness to provide land for the building of two nuclear stations on land adjacent to Sellafield. The NDA – which owns the site, near the village of Seascale, in west Cumbria, and rural land around it – expects any new nuclear power stations to be built by a commercial organisation. Brown also met community leaders and backed the nuclear power industry. \"I think today's announcement is great news for Sellafield and good news for British nuclear industries,\" he said. \"We are building a new range of nuclear power stations. Sellafield has got a great history ... it's also got a great future.\" The NDA has also announced the nominations of Wylfa, on Anglesey, Oldbury, in Gloucestershire, and Bradwell, in Essex, as potential sites for new nuclear power stations. The sites have been named under the government's Strategic Siting Assessment process, which will identify places suitable for nuclear new builds. Brown, who was accompanied on his visit by the minister of state for energy, Mike O'Brien, welcomed the nominations and said Sellafield was in a \"strong position\" to benefit from the UK's nuclear renaissance. \"During construction, each new station would bring as many as 9,000 jobs, create up to 1,000 skilled long-term jobs when operational, and be worth about £2bn to the surrounding region and wider economy,\" he said. \"Nuclear is crucial to our low carbon future – it is crucial to our energy security and at the same time it represents a massive opportunity for the UK economy and jobs.\" Sellafield, the world's first commercial nuclear power station, began generating electricity in 1956 and stopped in 2003. It is home to the Calder Hall and Windscale nuclear power plants, which are being decommissioned. Sellafield is also used to reprocess nuclear fuel and store large amounts of the UK's high and intermediate level radioactive waste. The site is to the west of the Lake District, which attracts millions of tourists every year, and is a major employer in west Cumbria. The Copeland MP, Jamie Reed, said it would be \"momentous\" for the local community if the government chose Sellafield as a new nuclear power site. \"Like every part of the country, the economic squeeze is apparent to everybody here,\" he added. \"This would provide more jobs for local people, and it will provide better opportunities for training local people.\" Derek Simpson, the joint leader of Unite, who also joined Brown on his visit, said: \"Pushing ahead with Britain's nuclear new build addresses the real concerns of real-life people. They want cheaper household bills. \"Building a new generation of nuclear power stations will create thousands of jobs in manufacturing in the UK. \"Nuclear energy can reduce our reliance on foreign gas and oil, and start to reduce household bills by 2015.\" Unite said it was also campaigning to ensure the UK's manufacturing industry carried out the majority of the work associated with any new nuclear reactors to be built in Britain. The union said it feared that the UK's dependency on imported oil and gas from Russia would be replaced by a dependency on France to supply nuclear technology. Hopwever, the Liberal Democrat energy spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: \"Nuclear power is an outdated and superficial answer to Britain's energy needs. \"It is dangerous and expensive and it won't fill the energy gap or help the fight against climate change. \"Liberal Democrats will not build nuclear power or dirty coal power stations.\" Nathan Argent, the head of Greenpeace's energy solutions unit, also hit out at the plans. \"Sellafield doesn't even have the right grid connections, so there's no way it could deliver electricity,\" he said. \"It would cost a fortune in subsidies to put these connections in, and, ultimately, it's the taxpayer that will have to foot the bill. \"Instead, Brown should be making a clever investment in energy efficiency. This would create tens of thousands of British jobs and also tackle fuel poverty and climate change in the fastest possible way.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/nov/15/nuclear-threats-terrorism-civil-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-15T00:05:05Z","webTitle":"Letters: Nuclear threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/15/nuclear-threats-terrorism-civil-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/nov/15/nuclear-threats-terrorism-civil-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear threats","bodyText":"Am I alone in noting that UK civil nuclear infrastructures are uniquely implicated in all four \"tier one\" threats identified in the recent defence white paper (Report, 19 October)?

Second, few targets for \"cyber attack\" present greater potential for harm than nuclear control systems.

Fourth, the foremost emerging instance of a new global \"military crisis\" lies in the widely mooted response to Iranian development of nuclear power. It is curious that the white paper makes no mention of this. The conclusions are not automatic.

More than £100bn of investment is needed by 2020 to replace our ageing power stations, cut carbon emissions, upgrade the grid and create new incentives to make this happen. Government proposals for electricity market reform were published for consultation in December and the cross-party energy and climate change committee has looked at the plans in detail. This Monday we publish our verdict. The proposals are a start, but the the government still has a long way to go. We fear that the plans will fail to attract the necessary investment in the electricity sector by 2020 and we will miss this opportunity to put the UK at the forefront of a worldwide revolution in low-carbon energy – one that could bring considerable competitive advantages. We have already seen a drop in investment for clean energy in the UK as the industry holds its breath waiting for greater clarity from the coalition. After coming fifth in the world ranking for clean energy investment in 2009, the UK has since dropped out of the top 10. At the heart of the reforms are new long-term contracts to encourage generators to deliver low-carbon energy. These contracts will give them a \"top up\" or \"feed-in tariff\" on the price they receive in the market if wholesale prices are low. These tariffs are necessary to bring forward low-carbon energy projects, which are often held back – despite lower running costs – because of the higher up-front capital expenditure needed to get them off the ground. However, the way the government proposes to design the contracts seems to be more about concealing the fact that it is providing financial support for nuclear power than it is about coming up with the best approach. This is politically expedient given the promise made in the coalition agreement not to subsidise nuclear. But this subsidy-by-stealth risks distorting the whole process of electricity market reform merely to save political face for the coalition. The government must not impose a one-size-fits-all reform on all low-carbon generation in order to avoid singling out nuclear for support. It needs to be upfront about its financial support for nuclear energy and recognise that different technologies, like wind or solar, will require a different kind of support. The government should leave it to independent experts to design feed-in tariffs that will promote all kinds of low-carbon technologies, not just nuclear. To meet our climate change targets we will need a mix of nuclear, renewables and carbon capture and storage for coal and gas plants. Nuclear has an essential role to play. Smart grids, energy storage and better renewable technologies might conceivably reduce the need for nuclear eventually, but that is a long way off. In the meantime, we need nuclear to provide clean steady \"baseload\" power. The government needs to come back with a much more ambitious plan for market reform. They must accept the pathway of carbon cuts proposed by the independent Committee on Climate Change, and start with an objective to slash the carbon intensity of our power stations by 2030. Currently, coal-burning power stations produce 900g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity. Gas is between 400 and 640g CO2/kWh, nuclear can be as low as 19g CO2, and offshore windfarms produce as little as 9 to 13g. Energy companies must be given absolute certainty that we will not allow the dirtiest forms of power generation to continue beyond the 2020s. The maximum by 2030 must 50g per kilowatt of power. At the moment ministers are tinkering at the margins of the electricity market instead of bringing forward the radical reforms that are needed. Cleaning up our power sector will cost money, but the long-term benefits for the UK of having a secure, reliable and low-carbon electricity system are clear. In the short- to medium-term bills will rise, but in the long term people will see savings – ministers should be open about that. Every year we wait means more investment abroad and less chance of stopping the worst effects of climate change. • Tim Yeo MP is chair of the energy and climate change select committee"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/apr/03/honda-considers-suspending-uk-production","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-02T23:13:04Z","webTitle":"Honda considers suspending UK production after Japanese crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/03/honda-considers-suspending-uk-production","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/apr/03/honda-considers-suspending-uk-production","fields":{"headline":"Honda considers suspending UK production after Japanese crisis","bodyText":"Honda could be forced to halt production at its car plant in Swindon next month as the repercussions of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami reach British factories. At a crunch meeting this week, the Japanese carmaker will agree a plan on how to tackle the growing shortage of key components such as satnavs. Executives will discuss a range of options, including a temporary closure of the Swindon plant, which employs about 3,000 staff, or a period of reduced production. The plant makes about 165,000 Civics, CR-V compact SUVs, and Jazz superminis a year and is braced for a shortage of electronic, electrical and brake parts. Each car comprises about 20,000 parts, 10% to 15% of which come from Japan. A Honda spokesman said: \"All scenarios are a possibility. There will be an impact, although it won't be till May. We don't yet know what to do to get around the issue, but a decision will be made some time this week.\" Honda is by no means alone, with car manufacturers around the world expecting interruptions to production as component shortages spread worldwide. Toyota's UK plants in Burnaston, near Derby, and in north Wales are to continue a ban on daily overtime and fortnightly Saturday shifts imposed around the middle of last month, while a Nissan spokesman said the group was \"constantly monitoring the situation in the UK and all over its operations\". The shortage of parts in the UK is expected to become increasingly significant over the next month, since many components from Japan take six weeks to arrive. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \"The disruption in Japan will have an impact on the UK motor industry, but the scale and timing remain very uncertain.\" Initially, carmakers had hoped that most component manufacturers in Japan would be up and running in time to ensure minimal interruptions to overseas supplies. However, in the past fortnight it has become increasingly apparent that the damage and power shortages in Japan will have an impact overseas. Professor ManMohan Sodhi, an expert in supply chain management at Cass Business School in London, said: \"There has been an aftershock in car manufacturing that mirrors the aftershocks from an earthquake. They may be smaller, but they are still significant.\" In Japan, the economic damage caused by the crisis is already evident. Sales of new vehicles plummeted by 37% in March, the biggest monthly decline since 1974. Although none of the major car manufacturers suffered serious damage to factories, most cannot return to full operation until at least mid-May. Toyota had to halt production at all 18 of its plants in Japan immediately after the earthquake, although two have since reopened to produce a limited number of Prius and two other hybrid models. Honda said it would resume making parts for export markets tomorrow, with production due to restart at all its Japanese factories seven days later – but only at half their original capacity.

As I write this on Saturday morning, the product page contains the following announcement: Item Under Review This product is not currently offered by Amazon.co.uk because a customer recently told us that the item he or she received was not as described.We are working to resolve this as quickly as possible. In the meantime, you may still find this product available from other sellers on this page. I have a copy of the book for review, and I fail to understand how the product is different to the description, or even how this can be applied to a book in the first place rather than, say, a TV or a stereo system. The sanest explanation I can come up with is something like a faulty print run, but if so it's a very odd message to put up. Lynas himself believes it may be a result of disgruntled critics. Like George Monbiot he has been the subject of frenzied abuse from anti-nuclear and anti-capitalist greens for his stance on topics like nuclear power, \"at George's debate in London [Thursday] night I actually had to leave early as someone was shouting and trying to confront me,\" he told me yesterday. I am not generally given to conspiracy theories, but so far as I can tell there has been some kind of campaign to 'hack' the Amazon sales page - the book has been withdrawn and has consequently plummeted down the sales chart. I can imagine many candidates, from all those who have been sending me negative, vitriolic emails, and posting similar blogs. However, I have no idea about the actual truth behind this - all I know is that it has ruined the launch of the God Species on the first full day of sales. So far Amazon have not offered any explanation to Lynas or his publishers: \"I asked my publisher to sort this out with Amazon but they have been unable to ascertain either what is going on or how to fix it. Someone told me that this message should only apply to faulty hardware sold by Amazon, not to books.\" I attempted to reach their press office last night and this morning for comment and/or explanation, but nobody picked up the phone, and they've yet to reply to my e-mail, so I assume there's nobody in until Monday. When I get a response I'll update this blog (or post a new one). I can't see any grounds for the customer complaint described on Amazon's site. If it turns out that this is the result of mischief rather than cock-up, and it's this easy to have a book taken off the shelves of such a major distributor, then we could be witnessing the start of a very disturbing trend. Until somebody gets a response from the company though, we can't be sure what has happened. It's possible that there is an innocent explanation, in which case Amazon should give a lot more information when they do this sort of thing in the future. A retailer of their size and influence has a duty to be open and clear about incidents like this. Update, 22:30pm: As of this evening the book is back on sale, but no explanation has been forthcoming so far... Update, Sunday 11:05am: After two days, Mark has received information from 'a source within Amazon'. They suggest that complaints occurred because the book - a paperback, was listed as a hardback by mistake. As Mark points out though, the book was listed as a paperback in the screenshots that he and I took (you can see it above). Not only that, but a commenter below received a reply from Amazon customer services giving a different explanation, that there was \"a defective batch in our fulfilment centre.\" So we have two different explanations, and it's all a bit odd. An administrative cockup seems likely, but the point from my original post remains - a retailer as utterly dominant as Amazon really ought to be a bit more transparent and accountable. I'll give Mark the last words on this (unless I get a further response from Amazon): \"This does perhaps illustrate the dangers of market concentration when a single online bookseller now controls 70% of the UK market, and soon to be more if Amazon's takeover of The Book Depository is waved through by the British competition authorities. It certainly seems unfair that a book can be sunk through so easily and with so little justification because Amazon.co.uk is so dominant in the market and so slow to respond to complaints. I would hope that it could learn from this saga and tighten up its processes so other books do not suffer a similar fate immediately after they are launched. It seems very clear that if the Twitter campaign had not snowballed so quickly, the situation would still be unresolved now.\" Follow me on Twitter: @mjrobbins"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/aug/11/vince-cable-power-principles","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-10T23:05:54Z","webTitle":"Letters: Vince Cable's power and principles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/11/vince-cable-power-principles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/aug/11/vince-cable-power-principles","fields":{"headline":"Vince Cable's power and principles","bodyText":"Decca Aitkenhead tells us in her interview with Vince Cable ('I think the whole situation ... well, it's not comfortable', G2, 9 August) that almost everyone she knows who voted Lib Dem says the party has \"traded its principles for a taste of power\". Most Lib Dem voters would have preferred a different outcome, but it is surely a basic principle that one accepts what the people have voted for. The electoral system distorted party balances in parliament, greatly reducing the negotiating power of the Liberal Democrats and making a coalition with Labour unviable. The Labour party supports that electoral system on the grounds that distortion to give single party majorities is better than PR and coalitions. So the more the coalition is like a plain Conservative government, the more Labour voters should accept it, because their vote was implicitly for a Conservative-only government if the Conservatives won popular support \"first past the post\", as they did. Had the Lib Dems refused to assist in forming a government with a clear majority, the financial markets would have reacted badly, and the very existence of the Liberal Democrats would have been blamed for that. So the alternative to the coalition was a minority Conservative government, and most likely another general election called in months on the theme \"get rid of the Liberal Democrats to restore stability\". A basic moral principle is that no one should be accused of acting wrongly if nothing else they could have done would be judged better. So, though I hate much of what the coalition is doing, I shall continue to support the Lib Dems. My support strengthens the influence of Vince Cable and other Liberal Democrats in government because the more the party retains electoral support, the more it can stand up to the Tories using the threat of an early election. Matthew Huntbach London • Your interview with Vince Cable fails to mention one blot on his otherwise honourable character. It was built into the coalition pact that the Lib Dems \"maintained their opposition to nuclear power\". So it was a shock to see him trotting round India, peddling nuclear power. India is not signed up to the non-proliferation treaty and that was the reason that even the business-before-all Labour regime would not sell them nuclear power. The link between civil and military nuclear technology is the reason we seek to deny Iran's acquisition of nuclear power, a denial whose legitimacy is undermined by this export agreement. How much more genuinely helpful, to a country with which we seek to maintain close bonds, to offer technical advice on harnessing solar power resources or the purification of water. Catherine Macintosh Winchester • Decca Aitkenhead, in describing Vince Cable as \"looking rather like a university vice-chancellor – cerebral and unworldly, in a slightly crumpled suit\", is clearly out of touch with universities. Nowadays vice-chancellors see themselves as CEOs and dress as such, with sharp suits, haircuts and business jargon to match. Being \"cerebral\" would be a barrier to anyone being appointed to the job; being \"unworldly\" is right out. Ian Reader Lancaster • I know it is Guardian policy to give the Lib Dems, and Vince Cable in particular, an easy ride. But by what criteria can his statement on a visit to Teesside University – \"For someone like me, who went to Cambridge and is surrounded by those kinds of people, we tend to forget what universities like yours are doing\" – be described as \"self-deprecating\"? Sounds more like patronising twaddle to me. Kate Oakley London • I fell about laughing when I read Decca Aitkenhead's description of Vince Cable as \"the MP the nation fell in love with\". When the cuts start biting this winter, Vince Cable will be one of the most hated people in Britain, and deservedly so. Which side will the Guardian be on, I wonder – the people or the so-called Liberals who'll be bringing more misery to millions?

But proving that infant mortality hundreds of miles from the stricken nuclear plant has increased 20-30% in 20 years, or that the many young people suffering from genetic disorders, internal organ deformities and thyroid cancers are the victims of the world's greatest release of radioactivity, is impossible. The UN's World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency claim that only 56 people have died as a direct result of the radiation released at Chernobyl and that about 4,000 will die from it eventually. They also say that only a few children have died of cancers since the accident and, that most of the illnesses usually linked to Chernobyl are due to psychological distress, radiophobia or poverty and unhealthy living. But other reputable scientists researching the most radiation-contaminated areas of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are not convinced. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, another UN agency, predicts 16,000 deaths from Chernobyl; an assessment by the Russian academy of sciences says there have been 60,000 deaths so far in Russia and an estimated 140,000 in Ukraine and Belarus. Meanwhile, the Belarus national academy of sciences estimates 93,000 deaths so far and 270,000 cancers, and the Ukrainian national commission for radiation protection calculates 500,000 deaths so far. The mismatches in figures arise because there have been no comprehensive, co-ordinated studies of the health consequences of the accident. This is in contrast to Nagasaki and Hiroshima, where official research showed that the main rise in most types of cancer and non-cancer diseases only became apparent years after the atomic bombs fell. With Chernobyl there have been difficulties in gathering reliable data from areas left in administrative chaos after the accident. Hundreds of thousands of people were moved away from the affected areas, and the break-up of the Soviet Union led to records being lost. Controversy rages over the agendas of the IAEA, which has promoted civil nuclear power over the past 30 years, and the WHO. The UN accepts only peer-reviewed scientific studies written in certain journals in English, a rule said to exclude dozens of other studies. Four years ago, an IAEA spokesman said he was confident the WHO figures were correct. And Michael Repacholi, director of the UN Chernobyl forum until 2006, has claimed that even 4,000 eventual deaths could be too high. The main negative health impacts of Chernobyl were not caused by the radiation but by the fear of it, he claimed. But today Linda Walker, of the UK Chernobyl Children's Project, which funds Belarus and Ukraine orphanages and holidays for affected children, called for a determined effort to learn about the effects of the disaster. \"Parents are giving birth to babies with disabilities or genetic disorders … but, as far as we know, no research is being conducted.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/07/green-taxes-public-transport-fares","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-07T10:06:42Z","webTitle":"Rebuild trust in green taxes by cutting public transport fares, Treasury told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/07/green-taxes-public-transport-fares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/07/green-taxes-public-transport-fares","fields":{"headline":"Rebuild trust in green taxes by cutting public transport fares, Treasury told","bodyText":"The Treasury should ringfence money from fuel duty to cut rising public transport fares in a bid to rebuild trust in green taxes, MPs urged on Thursday. The public has lost trust in green taxation because the Treasury appears to use it as a revenue-raiser rather than an effort to reduce pollution, the environmental audit committee said. Recent government budgets had created the perception that taxes on things such as flights and fuel were \"simply being used to pinch extra pennies from people,\" the committee's chairwoman, Joan Walley, said. In a report on this year's budget and environmental taxes, the committee said the Treasury should ringfence some of the revenues from green taxation to invest in less-polluting alternatives. For example, funding raised from fuel duty should go towards lower bus and train fares. Green taxation \"cannot be all stick and no carrots\", the report said. The committee warned that green taxes needed to be straightforward and send a clear signal about behaviour to consumers, as well as be fair in order to build support for the measures. The committee said the Treasury needed a coherent strategy for environmental taxation and that ministers should be looking to shift taxes from things that help society such as jobs and incomes, to things which are harmful such as pollution. The MPs criticised the announcement in the most recent budget to cut a penny from fuel duty, in the face of rising petrol prices, while providing no new incentives for switching to low-carbon alternatives such as electric cars. They also said the proposed changes to air passenger duty – the tax paid by people when they fly – will not make it a more effective environmental levy or cut emissions. Walley said: \"The Treasury needs to stop giving green taxes a bad name. \"Recent budgets have created the perception that environmental taxes are simply being used to pinch extra pennies from people. \"Politicians should use green taxes more carefully to challenge and change the most polluting activities.\" She said the government should put its money where its mouth was by greening the economy at the heart of plans for growth. \"Green taxes shouldn't be seen as some kind of add-on or used as a revenue-raising trick – they should form an integral part of the government's plans to revive the economy. \"The Treasury should start to rebuild trust in environmental taxes by ringfencing some of the revenues raised from fuel duty to cut soaring train and bus fares,\" she added. The report, which examined the environmental impact of this year's budget, also said the Treasury's decision to prevent the proposed green investment bank from borrowing would limit its impact on boosting renewables and greening homes. It criticised the government's definition of subsidies for nuclear power, warning new reactors would effectively be subsidised. It also said the \"plan for growth\", published alongside the budget, did not provide the step change needed to shift the UK to a green economy – and in some areas, such as watering down the definition of \"zero-carbon homes\" which must be built from 2016, ministers have taken a step backwards. Campaign for Better Transport's sustainable transport campaigner, Sian Berry, said: \"A decade ago Gordon Brown promised that future increases in fuel duty would be ring-fenced for modernising transport. Unfortunately this was never put into effect. \"The coalition government should learn from this and commit to using increases in revenue from fuel duty as part of a wider package of measures to provide real choices in transport. \"The government should be helping people to switch away from environmentally damaging behaviour, but by actively raising train fares and cutting support for bus services, the government is doing exactly the opposite.\" Friends of the Earth's senior economy campaigner, Simon Bullock, said: \"The Treasury has consistently failed to play its part in tackling climate change – and its cack-handed approach to green taxation is little surprise. \"David Cameron must show real leadership by pushing the Treasury to lay the foundations for a low-carbon economy and ensure we all benefit from a green, safe future.\" AA president Edmund King said: \"The government was right to cut fuel duty when pump prices were at record highs rather than pretend that fuel duty is a green tax. Drivers are responding to fuel prices by driving less and selecting more economical cars, rather than responding to a green smokescreen. \"With recession and record fuel prices causing a significant reduction in fuel consumption by cars, there is leeway for government to review how drivers can be encouraged to reduce their CO2 emissions without declaring war on them.\" A Treasury spokesman said: \"The government is committed to being the greenest government ever, as seen by actions at budget and the plans to set environmental taxes in a clear and accountable framework. \"The government welcomes the committee's report and will respond to its recommendations in due course. \"As stated by the chancellor at budget, environmental tax policy is being developed in a way that takes account of all possible levers so that carbon reduction is done in the most effective way and takes account of wider priorities such as sustainable growth and sound public finances.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/12/britain-renewable-energy-targets-impossible","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-12T18:38:05Z","webTitle":"Britain's renewable energy targets are 'physically impossible', says study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/12/britain-renewable-energy-targets-impossible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/12/britain-renewable-energy-targets-impossible","fields":{"headline":"Britain's renewable energy targets are 'physically impossible', says study","bodyText":"It will be physically impossible for the UK to meet its renewable energy targets in both the short and long term, according to a group of engineering experts. In a new study, they called for the government to adopt a \"war-time\" mentality in their approach to dealing with climate change and consider experimental approaches such as artificial trees that soak up carbon dioxide to buy the time needed to build the required level of low-carbon infrastructure in the UK. The engineers, from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), said the government should invest in geo-engineering technologies that would either bounce sunlight back into space or soak up CO2 in the atmosphere. Some of the more exotic ideas include launching orbiting mirrors in space or seeding artificial clouds over the oceans, but the report advocates more research on artificial trees; growing algae on the side of buildings to make renewable fuel; and painting the roofs of buildings white to reflect sunlight. The government has committed to cutting the country's carbon emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050, both relative to 1990 levels. To achieve this, ministers have outlined plans to build thousands of wind turbines by 2020 and, this week, gave the go-ahead for 10 new nuclear power stations, with the first coming on line in 2018. But, according to the engineers, building the massive amounts of low-carbon infrastructure in time to meet the government's targets will be impossible. \"Current predictions are that we will be unable to service the current plans for offshore windfarms by 2013 because we won't have the construction vessels to do it and, by 2018, we'll run out of manufacturing capacity,\" said Tim Fox, lead author of the report and head of environment and climate change at the IMechE. In a report published tomorrow, the engineers instead outlined a \"battle plan\" for tackling global warming, which includes adapting to rising temperatures and investing in geo-engineering technologies, as well as current plans to invest in green energy technologies. \"The institution believes it's time to go to war on climate change – the climate is about to attack us and it's time for us to fight back,\" said Fox. He said that, even if the UK could cut its energy demand in half by 2050 through efficiency improvements, the country still needs 16 new nuclear power plants between now and 2030, and an additional 4 by 2050. Around 27,000 wind turbines would need to be built by 2030 and an additional 13,000 by 2050. That would be in addition to ramping up solar power, waste and biomass plants and developing a smart electricity grid and advanced energy-storage technologies. To work out how this would be built, the IMechE assembled a team of engineers, economists and civil servants. \"For the UK, if we want to decarbonise at the rate necessary for the climate change act between now and 2050, assuming a 2.5% annual increase in GDP, it will take a decarbonisation rate of 5% per annum to achieve that,\" said Fox. The best the UK has ever achieved was during the 1990s in the \"dash for gas\", when the UK was commercially-driven to change from coal-fired power stations to gas-fired power stations. Back then, the UK decarbonised at a rate 2.3% a year. Since then, the best has been around 1.3% a year. \"The ability to undertake the size of the task needed to meet the 80% target is not possible within a modern industrialised democracy,\" said Fox. Kevin Anderson, head of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, welcomed the IMechE's proposals. \"We are now in a situation of mitigation emergency and we do not have the luxury of the timeframes we had at Kyoto to bring about the changes necessary. In the wealthier parts of the world, we have a handful of years to turn our rising emissions around and bring them down at incredibly rapid rate. The UK has demonstrated a lead with the climate change act but this has not been accompanied by policies with teeth or a coherent strategy or roadmap.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said the report was too negative. \"The Institute of Mechanical Engineer's can't do, won't do attitude is sending out a defeatist message ahead of the crucial climate change talks in Copenhagen. The truth is that if we act now we can not only beat climate change but gain from the green benefits that will flow in terms of jobs and investment from going low carbon.\" But Fox said that the government's assumptions were based on an unrealistic idea of the number of engineers available. \"We're competing on an international stage and, if you look at the scale of engineering challenge worldwide, we're going to compete in the marketplace for the manufacturing of the wind turbines and the specialist vessels that are needed for their construction.\" To manage the future response to climate change, the engineers proposed that the mitigation, adaptation and geo-engineering should be brought together in a beefed-up version of Decc. \"It should bring together all the climate change activities from across all government departments into one new department called the Department for Energy and Climate Security. That department would be charged with appropriate powers to bring together all the necessary actions that are currently not being brought to bear on climate change,\" said Fox."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jan/20/iran-highly-enriched-uranium-wikileaks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-20T16:16:21Z","webTitle":"WikiLeaks cables: Iran has cleared major hurdle to nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/iran-highly-enriched-uranium-wikileaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jan/20/iran-highly-enriched-uranium-wikileaks","fields":{"headline":"WikiLeaks cables: Iran has cleared major hurdle to nuclear weapons","bodyText":"US officials believe Iran now has the \"technical ability\" to make highly enriched uranium, an essential step towards building a nuclear bomb, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable. At a meeting of international nuclear experts in Vienna, a US representative said that \"Iran had now demonstrated centrifuge operations such that it had the technical ability to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) if it so chose\". The meeting in April 2009 was hosted by Britain's ambassador to Austria, Simon Smith. The revelation comes as nuclear talks resume between Iranian officials and representatives of six world powers in Istanbul tomorrow. Expectations of compromise are low. Not all western governments share the US conclusion, but if true it suggests international sanctions have failed to deny Iran the know-how required to make a nuclear bomb. The production of HEU is generally agreed to be the most serious obstacle any aspiring nuclear state must overcome. Diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to curb its programme have also failed to produce results. In the days running up to the two-day meeting in Istanbul, Iranian officials have repeated they will not bow to UN security council demands to suspend uranium enrichment. Iran insists its programme is entirely peaceful. Western strategy is increasingly focused on delaying Iranian progress, buying time in the hope that economic pressure will eventually lead to a change of mind in Tehran. The campaign has had some recent success in the form of covert sabotage – the Stuxnet computer worm, reportedly a US-Israeli project, slowed down Iran's uranium enrichment last year. Other efforts have involved finding bottlenecks in the Iranian programme and trying to tighten them. Leaked US cables describe the outline of this containment policy. They reveal: • Russia has vowed never to allow Iran to make its own fuel for a Russian-built nuclear power station at Bushehr. • British officials have predicted Iran will amass 20 tonnes of low enriched uranium by 2014 – enough, if further enriched, to make 19 warheads. • In 2008, Washington launched a worldwide campaign to cut off Iran's supplies of a high-strength steel, known as maraging steel, and carbon fibre. Access to these materials has been identified as a bottleneck in its enrichment programme. Iran has always maintained its programme is intended for the generation of electricity, but its one nuclear power station, at Bushehr on the Gulf coast, is licensed to use only Russian-made fuel rods for its first 10 fuel loads, enough for just over 10 years. At the April 2009 meeting in Vienna, Russian officials assured their colleagues that even after that period \"Russia expects to supply fuel for the lifetime of Bushehr and it would not agree to provide Iran the necessary technology/licence to make its own fuel for the Bushehr reactor\". The experts at the Vienna meeting – from Britain, the US, Russia, France, China and Germany – noted that Iran had almost exhausted the original 531-tonne stock of the yellowcake it bought from South Africa in the 1980s. According to the 2009 US embassy cable: \"The French explained that Iran's current uranium stockpile was dwindling, with less than 100 tonnes of uranium remaining.\" British experts argued however that the focus on uranium ore was a red herring as Iran had already converted enough of it into uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas – the form in which uranium can be enriched in centrifuges – to keep the enrichment plant in Natanz running \"for several years\". The 2009 Vienna meeting agreed Iran would need 1.5 tonnes of low-enriched UF6 to make an initial bomb, then another tonne for each subsequent device. The UK calculated that by 2014, Iran would have amassed 20 tonnes – enough for 19 warheads. Britain officials now say that estimate might have to be lowered. Last year proved disastrous for Natanz – it had continual centrifuge breakdowns and suffered a complete shutdown for several days in November. That was in part due to the Stuxnet computer worm but western officials say other sabotage operations have taken a toll, as has the inherent unreliability of the rudimentary and outdated IR-1 centrifuge design used by Iran. The IR-1 is based on a design bought from Pakistan. It is built of a specialised aluminium and maraging steel, a rare commodity that has proved one of the most effective bottlenecks on the whole programme. Olli Heinonen, formerly the IAEA's head inspector and now a senior fellow at Harvard University, said he believed Iran had enough material to make 12,000 centrifuges based on what is known about its overseas purchases. The estimate is shared by some European officials. If correct, Iran has almost run out of centrifuge parts. It has made 11,000, of which 2,000 are believed to be broken and another 5,000 have been taken out of service. That leaves only 4,000 IR-1s enriching uranium at Natanz. Efforts have now shifted to stopping Iran building new-generation centrifuges which use lighter carbon fibre rotors and are thought to be at least five times more efficient. \"This is really important for the future of the programme. IR-1s are relatively fragile and inefficient,\" Heinonen said. Washington raised the alarm in 2008 and launched a worldwide campaign aimed at cutting off carbon fibre shipments to Iran. Cables were sent to US diplomats in European capitals and Beijing with lists of producers of carbon fibre and related equipment who were to be alerted to any suspicious orders. A few months later, in the last days of the Bush administration, the state department was scrambling to head off a shipment to Iran of 25 tonnes of maraging steel. It is not clear whether it succeeded. Ultimately, western officials admit Iran will find a way around any effort to stop the programme. At best, they say, it can only be delayed – its future will ultimately be decided by the leadership in Tehran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/20/george-monbiot-nuclear-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-20T13:28:03Z","webTitle":"George Monbiot: A kneejerk rejection of nuclear power is not an option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/20/george-monbiot-nuclear-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/20/george-monbiot-nuclear-climate","fields":{"headline":"A kneejerk rejection of nuclear power is not an option","bodyText":"One of my favourite environmental writers, my friend Merrick Godhaven, is taking shots at me and Mark Lynas. It concerns that most divisive of green topics: nuclear power. Merrick argues that if you express even qualified support for new nukes, it takes the pressure off governments to invest in renewables and reduce energy consumption. He also exposes the contradictions in the positions Mark and I have taken over the years. He has a point of course: governments will seize any excuse not to confront the electorate with hard choices, and to assist a powerful and none-too-scrupulous nuclear industry. But I feel we have a duty to be as realistic as possible about how we might best prevent runaway climate breakdown. It's true that my position has changed. As the likely effects of climate change have become clearer, nuclear power, by comparison, has come to seem less threatening. Three things in particular changed my view: • Reading the technical report by the Finnish radioactive waste authority Posiva. This seems to me to be a convincing demonstration that the long-term storage of nuclear waste could, in principle, be carried out safely. • Reading the paper by Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) paper on nuclear safety and security - I was also struck, reading all the papers in this series by the gap between the evidence the SDC amassed and the conclusions it came to. The technical papers suggested that modern nuclear power production is safe, sustainable in terms of uranium supply and a source of low-carbon electricity. The SDC's position paper, however came out strongly against it. I found this hard to understand. • Discovering that routine discharges of ionising radiation from coal plants are higher than from nuclear power stations But I have not, as many people have suggested, gone nuclear. Instead, my position is that I will no longer oppose nuclear power if four conditions are met: 1. Its total emissions - from mine to dump - are taken into account. 2. We know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried. 3. We know how much this will cost and who will pay. 4. There is a legal guarantee that no civil nuclear materials will be diverted for military purposes. None of them are insuperable. In the UK, condition four already applies: as long as chapter seven of the Euratom treaty is rigorously enforced. The big block is condition two. The most fundamental environmental principle, taught to every child before their third birthday, is that you don't make a new mess until you have cleared up the old one. It seems astonishing to me that we could contemplate building a new generation of nuclear power stations when we still have no idea where the waste from existing nukes will be buried. In these respects my position differs from Mark Lynas's. He would impose fewer barriers to building new nuclear power stations. So why contemplate nuclear power at all? Why not, as Merrick suggests, decarbonise our economy solely through energy efficiency and renewable power? In principle it could - just about - be done, as Mark Barrett at University College London and the authors of the ZeroCarbonBritain report suggest. But as you load more renewable energy onto the grid, it becomes more expensive and harder to manage. As Mark Barrett, ZeroCarbonBritain and the German government have shown, you could have a balanced, reliable electricity supply consisting largely of renewables. But the balancing costs will rise a good deal as the penetration of renewables increases beyond, say, 60 or 70%. It is also worth noting that some of the more ambitious renewables proposals will take at least as long to implement as a new nuclear programme. We could decarbonise the electricity supply quicker and more cheaply if we complement renewables with other sources. So what should these be? My priorities are as follows: 1. Gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) 2. Nuclear power 3. Coal with CCS 4. Gas without CCS 5. Coal without CCS I have listed them, in other words, in terms of their impacts on both the climate and the wider environment. While gas comes top of the list, we cannot ignore the threats to its security of supply (though this could possibly be ameliorated by means of underground coal gasification). All I am seeking to do is to be clear about the opportunities and obstacles. I realise that this will provoke hostile responses from almost everyone - including my friends - but we do our cause no favours by obscuring the choices we face. monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2011/aug/12/edinburgh-international-book-festival-director","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-12T21:55:15Z","webTitle":"Directing the Edinburgh international book festival: Nick Barley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/12/edinburgh-international-book-festival-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/aug/12/edinburgh-international-book-festival-director","fields":{"headline":"Directing the Edinburgh international book festival","bodyText":"\"What do you do for the rest of the year?\" That's what I'm often asked when I say I'm the director of a literary festival. One friend quipped after last year's festival, \"now you've got 48 weeks' holiday before the next one\". If only it were that straightforward. The intense days of a book festival are like harvest time for farmers: the product of a long year's cultivation. To produce a successful event requires a year of full-time work not just by me, but also by the other 15 members of our permanent team. There's been an explosion of literary festivals over the past couple of decades, with increasing numbers of people seizing the opportunity to meet and engage with authors. When the Edinburgh international book festival was launched in the early 1980s, there were just three literary festivals in the UK, whereas now there are more than 400. From the biggest and most talked-about such as Edinburgh, Cheltenham and Hay, to the gorgeous smaller events such as Wigtown in Scotland and Port Eliot in Cornwall, literary festivals have become some of the most vibrant forums for public discussion of the early 21st century. For anyone who thinks that the book is dead, the literary festival boom is clear evidence that reading, writing and ideas are anything but. Edinburgh, it has to be said, is not an average literary festival. Spanning nearly three weeks and with about 800 authors taking part, ours is the biggest in the world, with eight theatres hosting simultaneous literary events all day, every day. It would be easy for the logistical challenge of putting this schedule together to overwhelm everything else. But we are not interested simply in filling theatres for the sake of it: we hope to provide an intellectual framework, a series of themes to knit the programme together and offer a reflection on why books and reading play such an important role in our lives. Edinburgh has, of course, found plenty of success in staging festivals. The Edinburgh international festival and its cheeky alter ego, the fringe, are joined by 10 other specialist festivals to turn Scotland's capital into the most lively cultural city in the world, particularly in August. On top of that it's a city whose literary roots go deep. In 1883, speaking in Edinburgh, Louis Pasteur claimed that Scotland had been the first nation to link its fortunes with the development of the human mind. He was referring to the enlightenment of the late 18th century, which had arisen thanks not only to philosophers and scientists, but also to the concentration of printers and bookmakers in Edinburgh. It is perhaps not surprising that fiction writers were attracted to the city too. Each morning my walk to work passes the house in which Robert Louis Stevenson lived as well as Ian Rankin's favourite pub and the street where Alexander McCall Smith has based one of his serialised novels. And along the way I catch sight of an enormous gothic monument to Walter Scott. No wonder Edinburgh was awarded the designation of the world's first Unesco City of Literature in 2004. But the book festival doesn't only sell neeps and tatties each August. We set out to provide a reflection of \"the world, in words\" – a kind of mosaic of mirrors which adds up to an image of the world as it is today. This year during the course of planning the festival there was a succession of news events, each of which seemed to turn an aspect of the world on its head. Our plans were bookended by controversies over the nature of our news media, both of which were broken by the Guardian: before Christmas there were the Wikileaks revelations and then more recently the phone-hacking scandal. Both stories demonstrated that technology is changing the way journalism works – and raised fundamental questions about how the US and British governments go about their business. In between these crises there were revolutionary uprisings in north Africa and the Middle East, documented – and at least to some extent brought about – by writers using new media to spread the word. There was the assassination of Osama bin Laden, the safety crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and there were the continuing threats to western economies which brought some European countries to the brink of bankruptcy. All of this on top of the changes in society that don't make such big headlines: a steady erosion of public trust in politicians; the long-term issues that face Pakistan and Afghanistan; the rise and rise of China as a world power. Stepping back a little from the frenzy of the daily headlines and looking back over 10 years of breathtaking change in the world's social, economic and political landscape since the tragedy of the 9/11 attacks, it seems to me that we really are living through revolutionary times. So \"revolution\" is the overarching theme of the 2011 Edinburgh international book festival, and the programme is full of writers whose work has something important to say about these revolutionary events. Anyone who fears that politics and politicians have stormed the party and grabbed the limelight shouldn't worry. Ours is a literary festival and although we are welcoming a small number of politicians, none of them is coming to hawk election manifestos: for example Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, listens to Iain Banks talking about his latest science fiction story, while the former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell interviews James Robertson about the ideas he's mulling over for his next novel. They take their place alongside the likes of Julia Donaldson, the new children's laureate, who has selected a series of events looking at how children use fiction as a means of interpreting the chaotic world around them. At the end of the festival period there's no doubt that having gorged on ideas we'll be ready for a break from literature. But 48 weeks' holiday? I don't think so. With next year's book festival opening on the day of the closing ceremony of the Olympics, plans for 2012 are already shaping up fast.

The problem didn't develop overnight, of course. There was more than a decade of policy failure, as the government swung between a desire to introduce independent power producers and humour union demands that electricity generation remain a state-owned function. That meant no new generation capacity was built even as the economy expanded at a nice pace and an entire segment of the population, ignored under apartheid, was quickly connected to the grid. State power company Eskom caused maintenance slippage and saw some power stations supplied with poor quality or wet thermal coal. Failure to invest in the transmission network meant it was impossible to shunt sufficient power from the generation hotspots in coal fields to the north to industrial hubs in the south and east. But all of this only came home when, in the middle of unseasonably cold weather, ordinary South Africans were suddenly introduced to the concept of \"load-shedding\"; planned rolling blackouts that saw sections of the national network turned off for hours at a time. The process was later refined, but initially nothing and no one was spared: homes, hospitals, offices and factories were all shut down. Buildings posted prominent schedules outside elevators. Portable generators sold out as quickly as they could be stocked, and customers flocked to stores and restaurants that could continue operating while their neighbours fell dark. The situation improved relatively swiftly. After years of political paralysis, the government rapidly implemented energy-saving campaigns, while Eskom told neighbouring countries who had been buying power on the cheap to sod off, got its maintenance scheduling sorted out and secured coal supplies and transportation. A near collapse of the grid in January 2008 eased into less frequent outages by April, and by the time of the 2010 football World Cup, blackouts had become nothing but a bad memory. The damage had been done, however. During those dark days mines and heavy industrial customers were occasionally shut down, and at other times forced to reduce operations. Plans for new shafts and smelters were hastily scrapped and forward output targets were reduced. As it became clear just how big an investment would be required in new generation, and that electricity prices would more than double in the course of just a few years, even those companies who can deal with intermittent supplies started looking for other investment destinations. South Africa desperately needs power right now – and we need it on a budget. With half the population unemployed or underemployed and poorly skilled, only three sectors hold the possibility of lifting much of the country out of poverty: mining, manufacturing and agriculture. For generations all three were built on a combination of cheap electricity and cheap labour. With exploitation now legislated against instead of actively encouraged, and Asian markets offering workers at a discount, the labour isn't all that cheap anymore. Expensive electricity would be nearly as ruinous as no electricity. Cheap, in South Africa at least, means coal-fired. In parts of the Mpumalanga province high-quality coal is so plentiful you wouldn't be able to give the stuff away if it weren't for strong foreign demand. Hence the Medupi coal-fired plant, which will push out 4.8GW at full tilt once finished, and its sister station Kusile, which will max out at 4.8GW when it is finally finished some time after 2018. Both will rank among the top 10 largest power stations ever constructed. By comparison, the UK's largest power station, Drax, a bête noir of activists, has an output of 4GW. Just how much carbon those two behemoths will pump into the atmosphere is a matter of some debate, with scrubbing and sequestering techniques still to be finalised. Between the greenhouse gas emissions, the water usage and the impact on organic farming in the region, however, they're decidedly unpopular with environmentalists. Groups like the WWF eventually dropped opposition to Medupi, recognising its necessity, but still lobbied intensely (though ultimately unsuccessfully) against a critical World Bank loan for Kusile. South Africa, the greenies argued, just needs to get with the times and build more sustainable power solutions. What they got instead was a relative token: a 100MW windfarm and plans for another 100MW concentrated solar plant. After those the country faces a fork in the road, a choice between a nuclear future or one powered by solar and wind. Jobs will again determine the path, except this time those advocating for green solutions may be happier with the result. The Koeberg nuclear power station near Cape Town has been chugging along for more than a quarter of a century, but remains the only nuclear power plant in the country. After spending £800m, the government last year abandoned attempts to become a world leader in safe and easily built nuclear generation in the form of the pebble bed modular reactor, which turned out to be a little futuristic for current needs. On the other hand, the phrase \"green economy\" has increasingly been popping up in economic planning documents, both from the government and the ruling African National Congress, which most recently said it wants that see that sector employ 300,000 people over the next decade. Becoming a hub for green technologies, if only within Africa, should be a lot easier because over the next 30 years electricity production is going to see consistent spending on mega-projects. But paying several times the price of a megawatt of coal-generated electricity for the pleasure of being beholden to the wind or sun is a tough sell. The sudden fad for believing green infrastructure can create many jobs may well pass, as has the belief in the call centre industry and jewellery manufacturing before it. Politically the stars are in alignment. Money for renewable energy projects is available on easy terms, with or without carbon trading. Independence from finite coal reserves and foreign-made nuclear components is always attractive. And hey, it would be nice to host the COP17 meeting at the end of 2011 and be seen as a beacon of progress rather than an irredeemable smokestack country. • Phillip de Wet is the deputy editor of The Daily Maverick, a South African news and analysis website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/mar/22/nuclear-watchdog-iran-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-22T16:16:12Z","webTitle":"Nuclear watchdog chief accused of pro-western bias over Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/22/nuclear-watchdog-iran-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/mar/22/nuclear-watchdog-iran-iaea","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear watchdog chief accused of pro-western bias over Iran","bodyText":"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear watchdog at the heart of the growing Iranian crisis, has been accused by several former senior officials of pro-western bias, over-reliance on unverified intelligence and of sidelining sceptics. Yukiya Amano, a veteran Japanese diplomat, took command of the IAEA in July 2009. Since then, the west's confrontation with Iran over its nuclear programme has deepened and threats of military action by Israel and the US have become more frequent. At the same time, the IAEA's reports on Iranian behaviour have become steadily more critical. In November, it published an unprecedented volume of intelligence pointing towards past Iranian work on developing a nuclear weapon, deeming it credible. However, some former IAEA officials are saying that the agency has gone too far. Robert Kelley, a former US weapons scientists who ran the IAEA action team on Iraq at the time of the US-led invasion, said there were worrying parallels between the west's mistakes over Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction then and the IAEA's assessment of Iran now. \"Amano is falling into the Cheney trap. What we learned back in 2002 and 2003, when we were in the runup to the war, was that peer review was very important, and that the analysis should not be left to a small group of people,\" Kelley said. \"So what have we learned since then? Absolutely nothing. Just like [former US vice-president] Dick Cheney, Amano is relying on a very small group of people and those opinions are not being checked.\" Other former officials have also raised concern that the current IAEA is becoming an echo chamber, focused on suspicions over Iran's programme, without the vigorous debate that characterised the era of Amano's predecessor Mohamed ElBaradei. They point to Amano's decision, in March last year, to dissolve the agency's office of external relations and policy co-ordination (Expo), which under ElBaradei had second-guessed some of the judgments made by the safeguards department inspectors. Expo cautioned against the publication of IAEA reports that the Bush administration might use to justify military action. Some inspectors believed that amounted to censorship and western governments said it was not the agency's job to make political judgments. ElBaradei's advisers from Expo were moved sideways in the organisation, and the department's functions have been absorbed by the director-general's office. \"There has been a concentration of power, with less diversity of viewpoints,\" a former agency official said, adding that Amano has surrounded himself with advisors who have the same approach to Iran. Hans Blix, a former IAEA director general, also raised concerns over the agency's credibility. \"There is a distinction between information and evidence, and if you are a responsible agency you have to make sure that you ask questions and do not base conclusions on information that has not been verified,\" he said. \"The agency has a certain credibility. It should guard it by being meticulous in checking the evidence. If certain governments want a blessing for the intelligence they provide the IAEA, they should provide convincing evidence. Otherwise, the agency should not give its stamp of approval.\" Blix said he could not say for certain whether that had happened under Amano's watch. The IAEA would not comment on the criticisms, under a policy which avoids entering public debate. Western diplomats in Vienna, where the IAEA has its headquarters, defended Amano's management, pointing out that much of the material on weaponisation had been previously raised when ElBaradei ran the agency, albeit in less detail, and was based on 1,000 pages of documentation. \"It is arguable that ElBaradei was a slightly more benefit-of-the-doubt operator than Amano,\" one diplomat said. \"He might have fretted more about making judgments on evidence because he didn't have 100% confirmation. Amano says, 'I don't have 100% certainty, but it makes no sense saying nothing until a smoking gun is visible.' \" Some of the controversy around Amano's management dates to his election in 2009, when he narrowly beat Abdul Minty, a South African diplomat who championed the interests of developing countries organised in the Non-Aligned Movement, in a campaign which became a geopolitical contest between North and South. \"Amano's director-generalship began under a bad star,\" said Mark Hibbs, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The election was extremely polarised and bitter. Minty clearly appealed to states who see themselves as underdogs and have-nots. Amano was supported by the US and others who saw him as rolling back the IAEA's political aspirations under ElBaradei to a more technical agency.\" The acrid taste left by the election was heightened by the US diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks which revealed Amano's assiduous courting of American support. In an October 2009 cable, the US charge d'affaires, Geoffrey Pyatt, wrote: \"Amano reminded [the] ambassador on several occasions that he would need to make concessions to the G-77 [the developing countries group], which correctly required him to be fair-minded and independent, but that he was solidly in the US court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program.\" In an earlier cable in July that year, the Americans recount discussions with Amano on the future of officials, particular in Expo, \"some of whom have not always been helpful to US positions\". Last year, the named officials were moved to other jobs, out of the inner core which drafts the quarterly reports, like the controversial one on Iran in November. Hibbs argues that some degree of reorganisation was desirable and inevitable given the heated public battles under ElBaradei. \"Many states' diplomats were appalled that a small number of officials in the two [IAEA] departments were at war with each other and at the extent they were prepared to use the media to get their points across,\" he said. Under Amano, internal debates have generally not leaked, and he has centralised the organisation, insisting that most public statements come from his office. But this has not stop controversy from enveloping the agency, just as it did under ElBaradei. In the first major crisis of the Amano tenure, the Fukushima nuclear disaster following the Japanese tsunami a year ago, he was widely blamed for not acting quickly and aggressively enough. Criticism over the agency's outspoken comments on Iran has also focused on the director-general. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a Washington-based non-proliferation organisation, said: \"The main beneficiaries of the Amano reign have been US policy and the Japanese nuclear power industry. There has been no space between Amano and Barack Obama, and he withheld serious criticism of the industry during the Fukushima crisis.\" He added: \"On Iran, the difference is like night and day. ElBaradei constantly sought a diplomatic solution, while Amano wields a big stick and has hit Iran hard and repeatedly.\" On the other hand, Cirincione added, ElBaradei's more restrained approach had not succeeded in persuading Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium in line with UN security council demands. The facts of that accelerating enrichment programme are generally not disputed, only the intentions behind it. Cirincione also said new information has come to the IAEA's attention during Amano's stewardship, which may warrant the more detailed report on the possible military dimensions of the programme issued in November. Even Kelley, a fierce critic of the agency, said in a recent commentary that \"[Iran] claims to have given up its nuclear weapons ambitions, yet repeatedly acts as if it has something to hide. I am a sceptic; I suspect the Iranians may have an ongoing weaponisation programme. And the uncertainty must be resolved.\" Kelley argues that with war and peace in the balance, as well as the IAEA's credibility, anything it publishes must be thoroughly verified. In particular, he questions the agency's focus on a bus-sized steel vessel supposedly installed in an Iranian military site at Parchin in 2000, which the November report said was for \"hydrodynamic experiments\" – testing shaped, high-explosive arrays used to implode the spherical fissile core of a warhead and start a chain reaction. Kelley disputes the agency's logic. \"You don't do hydrodynamic testing of nuclear bombs in containers,\" he said. \"All of such tests would be done at outdoor firing sites, not in a building next to a major highway.\" Kelley also says the suggestion in the November report that weapons experimentation could be continuing is based largely on a single document, which ElBaradei had rejected as dubious. In his memoir, The Age of Deception, ElBaradei talks about documents supplied in 2009 by Israel, the authenticity of which was questioned by the agency's experts. Western government officials argue that with the use of advanced fibre optics, a containment vessel could be used to perfect the timing of explosive arrays, and say that evidence that has surfaced during Amano's tenure had added to the credibility of the Israeli document. However, the judgment of the US intelligence community is that weapons development ceased in 2003. Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iranian nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that US intelligence had become more certain over recent years in its judgment that Iran ceased weaponisation work in 2003. \"Amano has been way out in front of the US on this,\" Walsh said. \"I think if the agency is going to be a neutral player in this – and we need a neutral player to make the sort of judgements that have to be made – it will have to be more conservative that the national governments on this.\" The issue is critical. While there is no doubt that Iran is in contravention of US security council resolutions, and there is substantial evidence that the country had an organised weapons project up to 2003, the claim that work has continued has added to the sense of urgency that has fuelled the western oil embargo, due to take effect in less than four months, and threats of military action. Laban Coblentz, ElBaradei's former speechwriter and a collaborator on The Age of Deception, said that huge stakes could rest on the nuances with which the IAEA director-general interprets the evidence. \"It is a very difficult place to be sitting,\" Coblentz said. \"Amano and ElBaradei were looking at the same allegations. They have both said to their people: please pursue this. All that is the same. The other thing that is the same is that so far the most substantial allegations have not been verified. What has changed is the willingness to publish those allegations that have not been verified as a tool to pressure the Iranians to come to the table.\" Timeline July 1968 Iran joins nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) August 2002 The rebel group the National Council for Resistance in Iran reveals the existence of undeclared nuclear sites, including an enrichment plant in Natanz and a heavy-water production plant in Arak.

While it is been a pleasure to watch the mainstream of the Liberal Democrats coming home, it is noticeable that in Vince Cable we have a politician who is head and shoulders above all the politicians of his generation and particularly gratifying that his own reflections (I could press nuclear button to end coalition, says Cable, 21 December) mirror our concerns. But then, to Guardian readers, what's new about any of it? It would be very nice if all politicians would treat us voters as grown-ups, and the AV referendum will give us an opportunity to continue the process of a real shift in power – towards us and away from them – that this government is really about. The \"off the record\" briefing from \"sources close to the minister\" concerned have become a journalistic cliche for letting us know the diverse strands of thinking across and within the parties. Where on earth is the real embarrassment in saying these things openly? Stephen and Sally Jakobi Richmond, Surrey • If Vince Cable has so much power to \"bring the government down\" by walking out of the coalition, why has he not done it already? He has had plenty of opportunities. How about when his party abandoned its promise to scrap tuition fees in favour of voting through a crippling rise in fees? How about when his party overcame its opposition to nuclear power in October to approve the construction of eight new nuclear power stations? How about when his party compromised on proportional representation to campaign for a watered-down version of electoral reform, in the form of the alternative vote? When Green party MP Caroline Lucas sponsored an amendment, calling for true proportional reform to be included on the ballot paper for the referendum in May, Lib Dem MPs voted unanimously against it. This is yet another example of Lib Dems talking the talk, but not walking the walk. Cllr Adrian Ramsay Deputy leader, Green party • Vince Cable has a cunning plan to bring down the government. Does this mean his transformation from Robin Hood to Baldrick is now complete? Richard Bulmer Sheffield • Roy Hattersley (The Lib Dems need a revolt, 17 December) cannot see a revolt in the Lib Dems only because, like most commentators and Nick Clegg's inner circle (the former through ignorance, the latter deliberately), he conflates support for the coalition in principle with support for the party's leadership's practice of it. The current electoral system made the coalition inevitable; its distortions ruled out a coalition between the second and third parties that a proportional share of MPs would have allowed. Acceptance of this does not mean one must agree Nick Clegg has done a good job. He has fully lived up to his \"Calamity Clegg\" tag, making just about every mistake possible. Had he sought advice from the many Liberal Democrats with solid experience of handling balance-of-power situations in local government, our party would be much higher in the polls. Instead, his closest advisers are ad-men and PR types with little party background who see their job as selling Clegg to the party, as they have in the past sold much else of dubious value through the usual ad-men's trickery. Plan A – that the electorate would be so pleased to see Mr Clegg at the dispatch box that they would come flocking to us – has failed. It is obvious that Plan B – that the Conservatives' economic policies which we opposed in the election will work and a grateful electorate will eventually thank us for them – will fail more. Plan C is the revolt, and I see plenty of Liberal Democrats up for it, with the student fees issue bringing over huge numbers of former Clegg loyalists. I urge those members threatening to resign over Clegg not to do so – their support will be needed for the job that has to be done. Matthew Huntbach London • I find myself increasingly irritated by the castigation of Nick Clegg, the latest example of which you published on Saturday (So what was it, deputy PM, that made you forget liberty?, 18 December). For more than 40 years I have counted myself among that small band of loyal, idealistic purists who cast their vote for the Liberals in the knowledge that it would not have a hope in hell of changing anything but would be unsullied by compromise with reality. When Nick Clegg made a brave decision to enter a coalition with the Tories, it was clear this would not be a partnership of equals. So why all the cries of betrayal? Can the idealists not bear to have their fantasy policies tinged by the adult world of deficits and power brokerage? What Mr Clegg is actually doing is sacrificing any prospect of re-election for something in which he believes. I can do nothing other than commend him for that.

The scrutiny has focused on the agency's secretary general, Yukiya Amano, a Japanese diplomat who got the job in 2009 after energetic lobbying by Tokyo. Amano and his team have been blamed for long delays in issuing updates on the disaster at Fukushima. Nuclear officials argued that the fault lay not so much with the agency in Vienna as with its largely toothless mandate, which leaves it dependent on member states for voluntary compliance and control of information. The fiercest criticism came from a former Soviet nuclear expert who helped organise the clean-up after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Iouli Andreev said that corporations had deliberately ignored the lessons of Chernobyl in the pursuit of profit and had been abetted by the negligence of the agency. \"After Chernobyl, all the force of the nuclear industry was directed to hide this event, for not creating damage to their reputation. The Chernobyl experience was not studied properly because who has money for studying? Only industry. But industry doesn't like it,\" Andreev told Reuters news agency. He once ran the Soviet Spetsatom agency involved in the Chernobyl clean-up. He now teaches on nuclear safety and has served as an adviser to Austria's environment ministry. Andreev said that in order to cut costs, spent fuel rods at Fukushima had been too closely stacked in pools near the nuclear reactors. One of those pools caught fire, dispersing radioactivity into the atmosphere. \"The Japanese were very greedy and they used every square inch of the space. But when you have a dense placing of spent fuel in the basin, you have a high possibility of fire if the water is removed from the basin,\" Andreev said. He said the agency was too close to the corporations to enforce standards properly. \"This is only a fake organisation because every organisation which depends on the nuclear industry – and the IAEA depends on the nuclear industry – cannot perform properly ... It always will try to hide the reality.\" Officials in Vienna said the criticism implied a misunderstanding of the agency's role. They said that it had a mandate to demand inspections and judge compliance when illicit nuclear weapons programmes are suspected, as in Iran and Syria. On nuclear safety, on the other hand, the agency does not have the right of inspection and cannot criticise member states' nuclear power industries. \"The agency can facilitate the creation of a standard but cannot enforce that standard,\" an official said. Amano was also criticised at a press conference for his agency's slowness in informing the public. The agency's briefings have frequently been several hours behind press reports in Japan. However, nuclear officials with knowledge of the agency's workings said that according to an internationally agreed convention on early notification of an accident, agency officials had to verify any information they disclosed with the country in which the incident had taken place. Over the past few days, they said, that had meant sending press releases to Tokyo for approval and often waiting hours for a response."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/mar/23/navy-submarines-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T11:24:21Z","webTitle":"Navy to axe 'Fukushima type' nuclear reactors from submarines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/23/navy-submarines-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/mar/23/navy-submarines-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Navy to axe 'Fukushima type' nuclear reactors from submarines","bodyText":"The Royal Navy is to drop a dangerous type of reactor used in its existing nuclear submarines because it fails to meet modern safety standards, defence ministers have disclosed. A safer type of reactor is expected to be used in the submarines that will replace the Trident fleet, as the existing design shares very similar features to the nuclear reactors involved in the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan. Liam Fox, the defence secretary, told MPs there was a \"very clear-cut\" case to use the new type of reactor because it has \"improved nuclear safety\" and would give \"a better safety outlook\". A heavily censored Ministry of Defence report disclosed earlier this month by the Guardian and Channel 4 News said the current reactors are \"potentially vulnerable\" to fatal accidents, which could cause \"multiple fatalities\" among submarine crews. The report, written by a senior MoD nuclear safety expert, Commodore Andrew McFarlane, said the existing type compared \"poorly\" with those in the most modern nuclear power stations because it relied on a vulnerable type of cooling system, falling \"significantly short\" of modern best practice for nuclear reactors. McFarlane warned that the naval reactors are \"potentially vulnerable to a structural failure of the primary circuit\". An accident could release \"highly radioactive fission products\", posing \"a significant risk to life to those in close proximity and a public safety hazard out to 1.5km [1 mile] from the submarine\". Known as the PWR2, this type is used in the four Trident submarines based at Faslane, near Glasgow, and six Trafalgar-class ones now being taken out of service. Like the Fukushima power station north of Tokyo, the PWR2 relies entirely on back-up power supplies to provide emergency cooling in the event of an accident. Despite the anxieties about its safety, PWR2s are also being fitted in the seven Astute-class submarines being built. These vessels will also be based at Faslane. There have been debates within the MoD and the navy about whether the PWR2 should be used if a replacement to Trident is finally approved – or if a safer type, PWR3, should replace it. The PWR3 uses \"passive\" cooling, which makes it far less reliant on back-up power, and has additional methods of injecting coolant into a reactor. The PWR3 is widely used in modern US nuclear submarines. The debate has delayed a decision on what type of reactor to install by 18 months, McFarlane's report disclosed, and has cost a further £261m. Fox was questioned in the Commons on the reactor's safety by Angus Robertson, the Scottish National party's defence spokesman, after the disclosure of the report. Fox said: \"The government's view is that that is the preferred option, because those reactors give us a better safety outlook. That is a debate on both sides of the Atlantic, but we believe that in terms of safety, the case is very clear-cut.\" Robertson said: \"This still raises concerns about the currently operational and incoming nuclear submarines, which don't satisfy acceptable safety standards. The UK should give up its nuclear obsession.\" John Ainslie, from the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, who uncovered the original McFarlane report, said the new reactor would push up costs for the Trident replacement fleet by billions of pounds, since it would need designing and testing. \"There is another option: they should completely abandon their plan to squander billions on new nuclear submarines,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/15/japan-fukushima-nuclear-evacuees-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-15T07:07:00Z","webTitle":"Japan to pay compensation to Fukushima nuclear plant evacuees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/15/japan-fukushima-nuclear-evacuees-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/15/japan-fukushima-nuclear-evacuees-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Japan to pay compensation to Fukushima nuclear plant evacuees","bodyText":"Japan's government has ordered the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to compensate tens of thousands of households forced to evacuate due to radiation leaks. As many as 50,000 households within 30km (19 miles) of the plant will be eligible for provisional damages, which have been set at ¥1m (£7,300) per family and ¥750,000 for single-person households. The bill will reach ¥50bn, the president of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), Masataka Shimizu, told reporters. Additional compensation claims expected from farmers and fishermen who have had their livelihoods destroyed could see the total rise much higher. Tens of thousands of people were forced to leave last month after the government evacuated areas within 20km of the facility, where engineers are still confronted with huge amounts of radioactive water and overheating reactors. Earlier this week the government said it would expand the no-go zone to five communities further from the plant where radiation levels could pose a long-term threat to health. The firm has come under mounting pressure to compensate residents forced to move to evacuation centres around the country. With no end in sight to the crisis, government officials are unable to say when or if the residents will be able to return. Processing the payments is expected to take time given the geographical spread of evacuees, but Japan's trade ministry insisted the payments would be made \"as soon as possible\". \"There are around 150 evacuation centres, so it will take time until everyone gets their money,\" the trade minister, Banri Kaieda, said. \"But we want the company to support those people quickly.\" Meanwhile, health officials have been advised to collect blood from the hundreds of plant workers operating in hazardous areas in case they require stem cell transplants due to exposure to dangerous levels of radiation. Writing in the medical research journal Lancet, Japanese experts said the blood samples would provide a source of stem cells that could be used to rebuild bone marrow in the event of accidental exposure. \"The danger of a future accidental radiation exposure is not passed, since there has been a series of serious aftershocks even this April,\" wrote Dr Shuichi Taniguchi, of Toranomon hospital in Tokyo, and Dr Tetsuya Tanimoto, of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. Collecting blood from the workers would rule out the need to find matching donors, whose cells could be rejected, and minimise the chances of infection. Japan's nuclear safety commission has so far resisted calls to harvest blood to avoid causing panic among the workers, the men claimed. On Thursday, police officers in protective suits, goggles and gloves, entered areas within 10km of the plant to recover the bodies of people who had been left where they died in last month's earthquake and tsunami. By Friday, police said they had identified 10 bodies and were working to free them from the debris. There are thought to be as many as 1,000 bodies inside the zone. The agreement to pay compensation comes as speculation grows over Tepco's future. The company is the most reviled in Japan, but the government appears to have concluded that it cannot be allowed to fail. The Nikkei business newspaper said the government was considering setting up a state-backed insurance fund to keep the firm afloat and enable it to pay damages. The government would pay the bill initially, with the utility expected to repay the sum over several years. Full nationalisation of the firm now appears unlikely. Tepco has lost more than three-quarters of its market value over the past five weeks and JP Morgan estimates it could be saddled with a compensation bill of up to ¥2tn in the current financial year. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch warned the total damages payout could soar to $130bn (£80bn) unless there is a quick end to the crisis. Other ideas being floated would cap Tepco's liabilities at between ¥2tn to ¥3.8tn and spread the remaining costs among the state and other utilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/jul/18/nuclearpower.alternativeenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-18T16:05:33Z","webTitle":"John Sauven: Nuclear power failure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/18/nuclearpower.alternativeenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/18/nuclearpower.alternativeenergy","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power failure","bodyText":"Just this week Prime Minister Gordon Brown confidently assured us that the UK was at the forefront of a global \"nuclear renaissance\" and that within a few years we'd be home to at least eight bright, shining new reactors. We're told a week is a long time in politics, but it must seem an absolute eternity to the ever more bedraggled British nuclear industry. Yesterday the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) published its annual report and the predictable news was that the cost of decommissioning existing reactors and dealing with our legacy of radioactive waste has rocketed yet again. The bill now stands at a whopping £73bn, up from £53bn in 2006. That's an increase equivalent to the entire cost of the London 2012 Olympics each year. Some experts believe that the real total might be more than £85bn. This is a staggering amount of taxpayers' money. Just to put the figure into context, it's about the same cost as the entire Apollo Programme that took man to the moon. Sadly, unlike JFK's lunar mission, in this case we have nothing to celebrate. What that money buys us is merely desperate grappling with the radioactive and toxic legacy of nuclear power. The NDA claims the overall figure will be kept down because it will generate revenue through its commercial operations. But the idea that the NDA's commercial operations can guarantee this income is laughable. A big slice of the revenue they want to rely on for a century or more depends on two of the biggest white elephants in nuclear industry history – Thorp and the Sellafield Mox Plant. The Thorp reprocessing facility was shut for years following dangerous radioactive leaks and is now closed until Christmas while a new evaporator is fitted. Meanwhile it was recently announced to surprisingly little fanfare that the Mox plant, which cost nearly half a billion pounds, has produced next to nothing since it was built. Relying on these for a guaranteed income is like putting your faith in a sprig of flowers to ward of the plague. The fact that the NDA is playing a central role in working out how much waste from new reactors might cost to dispose of should make all of us stop and think about the merits of any new nuclear programme. The taxpayer is picking up the tab for all these failures and cost increases now, and as the Public Accounts Committee stated recently, it is impossible to guarantee that the taxpayer will not pick up the tab for new nuclear power stations too. Government promises that there will be no subsides for its new nuclear programme are almost worthless. Despite all the rhetoric and improbable promises about the benefits of new nuclear reactors, the real picture is grim. Much like the recent news that British Energy is paying twice as much to get two of its creaking UK reactors back on line (the bill is now more than £100m). And the rumours that French state-owned nuclear utility Electricite de France is having second thoughts about buying British Energy. But before we conclude that this is a British malaise, this week brought the startling announcement from France that all its nuclear reactors must now be checked so that leaks of radioactive waste into local rivers, as happened at one site last week, don't happen anywhere else. This comes hot on the heels of the construction blunders at the new reactor site in Flamanville that led to the French nuclear authority suspending the project. These are the reactors and companies that are touted to deliver Brown's \"nuclear renaissance\", but unless stopped, the prospect is of a much more disastrous and expensive rerun. A fall from the giddy heights of Brown's expansive nuclear dreams at the start of the week takes some beating. However, the one thing the nuclear industry really excels at is shooting itself in the foot. Which means we can probably expect more of the same before the summer's out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/13/greenpeace-foe-charles-secrett-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-13T15:58:44Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth hit back over 'out-of-touch' criticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/13/greenpeace-foe-charles-secrett-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/13/greenpeace-foe-charles-secrett-criticism","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth hit back over 'out-of-touch' criticism","bodyText":"The green movement is \"out-of-touch, ineffective and bureaucratic\", according to the campaigner who spent a decade leading Friends of the Earth in the UK , which celebrates its 40th anniversary on Wednesday. \"Worryingly, in every major green group, managers, administrators, communicators and fundraisers outnumber campaigners and researchers. Interminable meetings, not action, are the order of most days,\" wrote Charles Secrett, FoE executive director until 2003, in an article for the Guardian. He estimates UK groups like FoE, Greenpeace, RSPB and WWF, which have millions of members, spend over £100m a year. His comments have drawn an angry response from those leading today's groups. With climate change having dropped down the international political agenda, and the global financial crisis prompting leaders and businesses to question green spending, the environmental movement is at an impasse, argued Secrett. He later told the Guardian: \"The evidence of failure is there for all to see, as environmental problems are getting worse, not better.\" Previous dips during recessions have seen the movement bounce back stronger than before, he said, but warned: \"It is very tough now. There is no time left as the degradation of the environment has reached a tipping point.\" Secrett praised new groups like UK Uncut, which has taken direct action on tax avoidance, and online campaigns like 38 Degrees. But he said groups, new or old, running their own single-issue campaigns in parallel would never achieve the critical mass needed to push humanity onto the path of sustainable development, by tackling global warming and the loss of habitats and the animals and plants in them. \"If millions of people acted to hold politicians to account, that push would happen,\" he said. \"There is a crucial role for the environmental movement now in building a consensus for change. We can't rely on politicians and business people to do that.\" But he said current campaigners were too often \"conservative and unimaginative\", adding \"ambition is lacking through the fear of being seen to be too political\". Secrett's comments prompted a strong reaction from the groups criticised, many of whom have been rethinking their campaign strategies this year. Ben Stewart, the head of media at Greenpeace, said: \"I suppose I'm one of the PR people Charles is talking about. Right now I'm aboard one of our ships somewhere off the coast of Greenland where we've been hanging off an oil rig and stopping risky deep water oil drilling for several days. We've had 20 people arrested, more than half of whom are still in jail, and I know they're very grateful for the staff back home, including the fundraisers, who made our campaign out here possible.\" The current executive director of FoE, Andy Atkins, firmly rebuffed the criticism: \"We're not afraid to look at what we need to do differently: for 40 years we've been evolving so we keep winning campaigns. But some things haven't changed – FoE was a campaign-led organisation when we started in 1971, and we remain so today. Together with our supporters we've been winning real victories [such as] getting the world's first law to limit climate emissions, here in the UK, in 2008.\" Other NGOs defended a more subtle approach to campaigning. Martin Harper, RSPB conservation director, said: \"Shock tactics have their place, but no matter how loudly you shout, you will become background noise sooner or later. The most successful modern NGOs are those that know when to be a thorn in the side, and when to be a constructive partner. The RSPB is in the day-to-day job of conserving wildlife – and to do that we need to work closely with government and industry on a range of issues. \" However, Secrett's attack was supported by some environmentalists. Author Mark Lynas said: \"I agree the green movement is stuck in a rut, but I think the problem is deeper than mere professionalisation and endless strategy meetings in corporate NGO head offices. \"Many 'green' campaigns, like those against nuclear power and GM crops, are not actually scientifically defensible, whilst real issues like nitrogen pollution and land use go ignored. The movement is also stuck in a left-wing box of narrow partisan politics, and needs to appeal to a broader mass of the public who are simply not interested in organic farming and hippy lifestyle choices. It needs to re-engage with science, as well as with the general public, if it is to remain relevant to the 21st century.\" Secrett's intervention also echoes comments made by another senior green figure, Jonathon Porritt, who earlier this year accused the green NGOs of \"betrayal\" over their lack of opposition to the proposed sell-off of public forests, now abandoned. \"It demonstrates to me how completely out of touch our environmental NGOs have become,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/13/japan-nuclear-plant-evacuees-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-13T13:36:49Z","webTitle":"Fukushima evacuees demand compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/japan-nuclear-plant-evacuees-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/13/japan-nuclear-plant-evacuees-compensation","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima evacuees demand compensation","bodyText":"Residents and business owners in Japan who have been forced to leave their homes amid radiation fears on Wednesday demanded immediate damages from the company at the centre of the nuclear crisis. About 20 people who have been evacuated from areas near the Fukushima Daiichi plant protested outside the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) headquarters, calling for a quick decision on possible compensation. The company's president, Masataka Shimizu, apologised during a rare public appearance and said he would compensate the tens of thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted by the nuclear emergency. Japanese media suggests other domestic utilities could be asked to help pay damages, an approach adopted in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island disaster in the US in 1979. Shimizu and other Tepco executives bowed in apology and promised that cash payments were being prepared. Shimizu, whose handling of the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl has been widely criticised, said the firm would do its utmost to stabilise the stricken reactors and enable evacuees to rebuild their businesses. Safety officials have raised the severity level of the crisis to a maximum seven – the same as Chernobyl – although the quantities of radiation at Fukushima are one-tenth of those released by the Soviet plant. Government officials have conceded it could take months to bring the reactors under control. Fears of contamination have devastated farming and fishing communities in the area. Tepco, however, was unable to say when compensation would be paid, or how much. The promise of cash was not enough for one protester outside the firm's headquarters in the capital. \"I can't work and that means I have no money,\" Shigeaki Konno, a car mechanic who lived seven miles from the Fukushima plant before he was forced to leave, told Reuters. \"The talk about compensation is not concrete. We need it quickly.\" Kensuke Takeuchi, a manager at Tepco, said the firm was not yet in a position to compensate residents, adding that he would pass on the protesters' demands to executives. Despite the magnitude of the accident, and errors in Tepco's initial handling of the crisis, the government appears determined to ensure the firm's survival. Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Tepco and the government were considering placing a £15bn to £28bn cap on the company's liabilities to avoid financial ruin in the face of compensation claims that could reach £80bn. The nuclear power company, which has lost three-quarters of its market value since the tsunami on 11 March, is Japan's largest issuer of corporate bonds and its shares are widely held by financial institutions. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said he was not aware of the payout plan. \"I have not been notified beyond what has been reported in the media,\" he said. On Tuesday the prime minister, Naoto Kan, said Tepco would be responsible for compensating victims but it was the government's job to ensure the payments were made. Shimizu said he was not aware of the scheme, and refused to discuss calls for his resignation. \"My biggest responsibility is to resolve the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, support people who have been evacuated and make sure we provide electricity by overcoming the supply shortage as soon as possible,\" he said. \"I am not in a position to comment on whether or not I will resign.\" Under the proposals Tepco would be required to pay 100bn to 200bn yen a year for 15 years. Other utilities would contribute to a 2.7tn yen fund, with the remainder of the compensation coming from the state. The agony for communities near the plant shows no signs of ending, despite assurances from Kan that the operation to reduce radiation leaks was making progress. Sixteen towns and facilities have been ordered to stop shipping produce, while tsunami damage has destroyed fishing and farming businesses across Japan's north-east coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
