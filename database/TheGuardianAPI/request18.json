Any suite of 2030 climate targets agreed now could be taken to a UN conference in Lima this December, allowing a push for reciprocal moves from other countries before a global summit in Paris next year, where a climate pact is supposed to be agreed. But six central and east European states want more financial support before agreeing EU proposals to cut greenhouse gas output by 40%, improve energy efficiency by 30% and guarantee a 27% market share for renewables by the next decade’s end. The Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb told the Guardian that, at a ministerial summit in Milan yesterday, Britain had “taken a much stronger role than it used to and that is good news. The UK will be needed for brokering a deal on burden-sharing as they have a big vested interest here. We need all the big muscles we can get to solve this and the UK brokering a deal would be warmly welcomed.” Resolving objections from Poland, which is dependent on coal for 90% of its electricity, remains the bloc’s most tenacious obstacle. Two months ago, the country said that by 2050 coal would still be its primary energy source and renewable sources would provide just 15% of energy. The EU has pledged to cut emissions by 80-95% by mid-century. In a separate report to the UN climate secretariat last year, Poland actually projected an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The country’s prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, says that implementing the EU’s planned 40% CO2 cut would increase power prices by 120%, and has vowed to oppose any measures that increase energy bills. “There is no consensus on the number of targets, and there is no discussion on funding the burden, only discussion on fair burden-sharing,” a Polish government source said, on condition of anonymity. But “the UK is trying hard to prove that a deal can be done,” the source added. “Its clear position is that the EU needs just one target.” Asked whether Poland could again veto a bloc climate deal, the source said: “We are working hard to strike a deal that is good for all sides. If we feel the burden is not shared fairly, our option to disagree is there, but it is a last resort and we are not keen to use it. We believe there is room for a deal.” Stubb said that Poland had an interest in agreeing a deal in October, before the country’s former prime minister Donald Tusk takes the helm of the European Council. The Danish climate and energy minister, Rasmus Helveg Petersen, was also optimistic that a deal was possible, partly due to British interventions. “Ed Davey is taking a leadership role on setting ambitious targets and it is very much to his credit that we’ve made so much progress,” he told the Guardian. “Ed has taken a lead on [energy efficiency], and the greenhouse gas problem of ‘how many roads lead to Rome’. Sometimes we are not in full accord on which route to take but we have an overall objective and it is just a question of the means.” The UK has held out for national control over how CO2 cuts are implemented, arguing that nuclear power, shale gas and experimental Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology could be more cost-effective than renewable power or energy-saving investments. A debate is still raging over whether the renewables and efficiency targets should be binding at national level or just aggregated across the bloc, to take into account states like Denmark, which aims to meet the 40% cut by 2020, a decade early. By the same year, Denmark expects half of its electricity to come from wind power, and it plans to be fossil fuel-free by 2050. Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate secretary, told the Liberal Democrat conference that on the 2030 goals: “Britain is winning and leading the argument. Today I hand over the negotiating baton to Mr Cameron, he must not drop it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/nov/13/the-us-china-deal-on-climate-change-is-this-centurys-most-significant-agreement-it-puts-g20-goals-to-shame","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-12T23:33:16Z","webTitle":"The US-China deal on climate change is this century's most significant agreement.

It puts G20 goals to shame","bodyText":"The announcement by Barack Obama and Xi Jinping of an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions is a fine illustration of the difference between the real and ostensible functions of international summit meetings like the G20. Ostensibly, the G20 leaders were supposed to agree on a plan to increase the rate of growth of GDP by two percentage points for the next five years. As an aspirational statement of what might happen given a perfect alignment of the economic stars, such an estimate would be highly optimistic. It would imply, for example, a doubling of the rate of growth in income per person for developed countries like Australia. As a policy goal, to be achieved by specific measures agreed at the G20 meeting, the target is about as realistic as establishing world peace or ending poverty. The G20 policy agenda is a grab bag of second-order measures (the most substantive is spending 0.5% of GDP on infrastructure) that might marginally increase the long-term rate of economic growth but will have no perceptible impact over the next five years. That’s assuming if the G20 leaders can manage to push them through. All of the measures have been on the wishlists of various policy players for years, so the fact that they aren’t already in place suggests that they face big political or institutional obstacles in the countries concerned. By contrast, the US-China agreement on climate change is the real deal and illustrates the real function of events like G20. By bringing the leaders of 20 or more major countries together in one place, G20 facilitates one-on-one or small group meetings between them, either to respond to immediate crises (Abbott and Putin) or to announce the finalisation of negotiations that have been going on behind closed doors for months (Obama and Jinping). Substantively, the deal is the most important in the long and tortured history of international climate negotiations. This bilateral deal, along with the recent unilateral commitments of the European Union, encompasses more than half of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions and the great majority of emissions from developed countries. It now seems highly likely that most countries meeting at Paris in 2015 will bring commitments to substantial mitigation of emissions. Of the two commitments, China’s promise to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 at the latest is the most significant. With emissions in most developed countries already falling, offsetting rising emissions elsewhere, this means that global emissions will peak around the same time. The US commitment to accelerate reductions in emissions, reaching a level 26 to 28% below 2005 levels in 2025 is important for a couple of reasons. First (although comparisons are problematic), it puts the US ahead of the EU, historically the leader in the transition to a decarbonised economy. Second, the fact that Obama could announce with reasonable confidence is an indication that the economic costs will be low, and that the necessary policies can, if necessary, be implemented without Congressional assent. The commitments made so far leave the world with just enough time to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at 450 ppm. But there is every reason to think that, once these goals are achieved easily, more ambitious goals will be set. The remaining question is that of the holdouts: significant emitters who have made no commitment, or no adequate commitment, to rein in their admissions. India is the most important, and has legitimate objections to any deal that would require it to hold emissions permanently below the levels of richer countries. But there are many mechanisms, from technology transfer to a global allocation of tradeable carbon credits, that would permit wealthier countries to bear most or all of the costs of decarbonization in India. Japan, which is still dealing with the sudden closure of most of its nuclear power stations following the Fukushima disaster is another special case. If a substantial portion are restarted, and the recent expansion of renewables is continued, Japan should be back on track before long. If this can’t be done, Japan could buy credits to finance emissions reductions elsewhere (from India, for example). That leaves two rich countries whose governments have simply chosen to shirk the task rather than promote change in their economies: Canada and Australia. Canada has withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, while Australia has offered only a 5% reduction in emissions relative to 2000 levels by 2020. It is hard to believe that this position can be sustained in the face of the US-China agreement. The government remains officially committed to reductions of 15 to 25% if the world as a whole reaches an ambitious agreement, and it will be very difficult to argue that this goal has not been achieved, at least in broad terms. The formal G20 meeting will go ahead as planned, with lengthy discussions and a forgettable final communique. But the real action has already taken place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/12/energy-department-withholding-details-multi-billion-pound-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-12T08:59:47Z","webTitle":"Energy department withholding details on multibillion-pound projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/12/energy-department-withholding-details-multi-billion-pound-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/12/energy-department-withholding-details-multi-billion-pound-projects","fields":{"headline":"Energy department withholding details on multibillion-pound projects","bodyText":"Key information about the progress of many of the UK government's most costly projects is being withheld by the energy department, the Guardian has found. In contrast to all other government departments, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is refusing to release progress reports for 12 out its 13 major projects, which include the green deal for energy-efficient homes, smart meters, electricity market reform, new nuclear power stations and its nuclear waste storage programme. As a result, there is no way for the public to know if these projects are running over-budget, over-time, or have been granted \"red\" status, meaning \"successful delivery of the project appears to be unachievable\". Many of the Decc projects have been delayed or suffered other setbacks, such as Cumbria's county council voting against hosting a deep nuclear waste store. Together, the \"whole life costs\" of Decc's 13 projects amount to £81bn, which includes spending expected from the private sector. This figure is second only to the Ministry of Defence, which has a programme of major projects valued at £88bn. In contrast to Decc, the MoD has exempted only eight of its 36 major projects. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \"The refusal of Decc officials to publish vital information about the progress of billion-pound projects suggests a worrying disregard for transparency and an unwillingness to play by the same rules as other departments on accountability. The public has a right to know how their money is being spent and whether policy decisions made by ministers are delivering good value.\" Lucas added: \"Given the evidence that Decc initiatives such as the green deal are running into trouble, I hope this lack of transparency doesn't reflect a desire to keep potentially embarrassing information about the progress of key projects out of the public eye.\" A Decc spokeswoman said: \"We're aware that other departments didn't exempt as many [projects] as Decc. Our exemptions reflect the fact that we have more projects in contract negotiations or the decision-making phase at this particular point of time. Publishing this commercially sensitive information would, at this stage, impact on the progress of the projects moving forward. Decc fully supports the transparency principle and we will publish information when the public interest in sharing the data outweighs that of withholding it.\" Out of the 191 government projects currently being monitored by the Cabinet Office's Major Projects Authority (MPA), just 21 have been exempted by their departments from having their progress reports published. These 21 exempted projects have been valued together at £48bn. Decc projects account for 12 of those 21 exempted projects. Eight government projects out of 191 have been rated as \"red\", with a further 23 rated \"amber/red\", meaning \"successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas\". There is currently no way of knowing if any of Decc's 12 exempted projects have received such negative ratings. The MPA's guiding principles state that exemptions should be \"made sparingly\". It adds: \"Publication and genuine transparency is the standard: there is a presumption in favour of publication.\" The only major project Decc has published a progress report for is the decommissioning of the Dounreay nuclear reactor in Scotland. It was rated as \"green\", meaning \"successful delivery of the project to time, cost and quality appears highly likely\". Luciana Berger MP, Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, said: \"It's no surprise ministers at Decc don't want to admit what a mess they've made of things. Under this government, investment in clean energy has collapsed, smart meters have been delayed and the number of people getting their homes insulated has slumped.\" Alexandra Runswick, deputy director of Unlock Democracy, which campaigns for greater government accountability and transparency, said: \"We know from our own investigations that there is a particular problem with Decc in terms of its intimate links to industry, with numerous industry staff working on secondment within the department itself and advisers moonlighting as industry lobbyists. When relations have got this cosy between government and industry, there is a need for far greater transparency, not less.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/aug/22/edf-pay-3m-compensation-ofgem-inquiry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-22T07:22:22Z","webTitle":"EDF to pay £3m in compensation after Ofgem inquiry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/22/edf-pay-3m-compensation-ofgem-inquiry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/aug/22/edf-pay-3m-compensation-ofgem-inquiry","fields":{"headline":"EDF to pay £3m in compensation after Ofgem inquiry","bodyText":"EDF Energy has become the latest of the big six energy suppliers to feel the heat of the energy regulator by paying out £3m to vulnerable customers after breaching complaints handling rules. The French state-owned group has been punished 24 hours after the Labour party unveiled plans to revoke the licences of energy suppliers that repeatedly act against the interests of consumers. Ofgem, the industry watchdog, has been investigating EDF after a 30% increase in complaints following the introduction of a new IT system. \"EDF Energy failed to have sufficiently robust processes in place when they introduced a new IT system and this led to the unacceptable handling of complaints,\" said Sarah Harrison, senior partner for enforcement at Ofgem. The £3m will go to a Citizens Advice energy scheme and a debt helpline. The energy supply company, which is also behind plans to build Britain's first nuclear power plant in 20 years, admitted it had let down customers with sub-standard service. \"We have cooperated fully with Ofgem and have taken this matter very seriously. The £3m package that we are offering will ensure that thousands of vulnerable customers are provided with free, independent advice on debt, as well as information to help them manage their energy consumption and bills,\" said Beatrice Bigois, managing director for customers at EDF Energy. Matt Ridout of independent price comparison site energyhelpline.com said Ofgem's action showed there was \"nowhere to hide\" for suppliers that were not providing appropriate service to customers. \"Poor complaints handling procedures, unacceptable call waiting times and technical difficulties due to IT failures are simply not good enough in this day and age, regardless of the excuse given,\" he said. There has been a growing pile of fines or similar payouts ordered over the last 18 months, including from British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power. A wider collapse of customers' trust and soaring energy costs has led to an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), taking place over the next 18 months. It will increase the pressure on the big six suppliers – British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF, npower and Scottish Power. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, has backed the CMA inquiry and fought to bring down energy prices. On Thursday, his Labour shadow, Caroline Flint, unveiled plans for a new regulator with the power to revoke licences and introduce an annual scorecard to monitor company behaviour. Labour has also promised that if it wins power next spring it will freeze energy prices to \"reset\" the market. This plan has been blamed by Paul Massara, the chief executive of SSE, for his company's failure to reduce household bills despite a 50% fall in wholesale gas prices since the start of the year. Massara said SSE would be unable to raise them again in response to increased costs if Ed Miliband won the general election. \"The potential Labour price freeze has, of course, also complicated all pricing decisions further,\" he said in a note attached to a formal submission to the CMA inquiry. Ofgem has more than a dozen further inquiries underway into energy companies and has imposed more than £120m in fines or redress payments since 2002. The watchdog has the power to fine companies up to 10% of global revenues – about £2.5bn in for a company as big as Centrica, the owner of British Gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/editors-blog/2014/oct/22/three-ways-to-improve-labours-housing-review","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-22T12:21:41Z","webTitle":"Three ways to improve Labour's housing review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/editors-blog/2014/oct/22/three-ways-to-improve-labours-housing-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/editors-blog/2014/oct/22/three-ways-to-improve-labours-housing-review","fields":{"headline":"Three ways to improve Labour's housing review","bodyText":"That’s it then, the Lyons review is done. Published and digested, Labour’s big housing policy review came to less than hoped. There’s a new fat tome set aside as a coaster on the desks of housing association and council managers, but the thorny problem of getting homes built remains unresolved. Chief among the objections to Sir Michael Lyons’ report was that it failed to say enough about how its proposals could be financed. Nevertheless its recommendations were an indication that a Labour government could do something practical to make sure that localism – and in particular the misapprehensions of voters – cannot be allowed to hold back the resolution of our national housing crisis. Suggestions that made it to the final cut included allowing local authorities to designate housing growth areas, allowing councils to borrow from other another to build homes and giving a national planning inspectorate powers to force authorities to draw up local plans. These are all sensible suggestions, but do they go far enough? The polite welcome of the report from housing experts was not a resounding endorsement of its content. The plan requires more teeth. However, it seems Labour might yet find their teeth and bare them. With Lyons as a backup, shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds is onto something. Speaking at the controversial Mipim property fair in London earlier this month, Reynolds told delegates that under a Labour government councils that fail to meet housing needs will face some “stick”. This suggests she’s willing to consider open criticism and sanctions for local authorities which, pandering to nimbyism, fail to work towards meeting national housebuilding targets and local housing needs. Of course Reynolds comments could be interpreted more passively. But, to play a thought experiment, there are some obvious ways which a Labour government could force councils to play their hand on housing while still protecting local democracy and localism. Here are my three ideas for the best sticks to beat unsupportive councils into action. Penalise councils that fail to work together to build homes Under current planning rules, neighbouring councils are supposed to work together to meet housing need across their boundaries. Rural councils are required to acknowledge the need to support their urban counterparts by allowing spillover where necessary to ensure the local population is supported. In practice, these adjacent authorities are often controlled by opposing political parties. Voters in different areas may have different priorities at the ballot box. Rural councils often refuse to provide land or building permission in areas surrounding an overcrowded and expanding city or town with no space left to build. Nimbyism is allowed to control development, much to the frustration of those left unable to meet housing need in the town. To make councils’ duty to co-operate function effectively there needs to be a worse alternative for those authorities that see no democratic or financial benefit to allowing new development. Give councils the opportunity to do it for themselves, but if they can’t agree a national planning body should step in and arbitrate. This is essentially a regulator for housing need, setting out what must be done if politicians and planners can’t manage it themselves. Knowing they could lose control over exactly what development happens where should make way for a new pragmatism in the planning. Reduce planning powers for underperforming councils Where councils are found to have repeatedly failed to respond to local housing need, they should be nominated for more controversial planning developments instead. Although onshore wind is actually the most voter-friendly energy installation, it is so politically controversial that in some areas communities secretary Eric Pickles has overturned successful planning applications. What if government were to do the opposite and prioritise those authorities shown to be failing in one important policy area – housing – for developments necessary to protect our energy industry? With a new generation of nuclear power part of Labour’s policy plans, it’s a stick that makes the carrot look a whole lot more edible. Ringfence money specifically for housing Finally, in areas of the utmost housing need and where planning and development has stalled, council funding should be ringfenced so that it has spent on housing or on tackling the problems holding back development. The pressure of having to make up the shortfall from elsewhere should concentrate the mind. Interested in housing?

Here come the hard-hat romantics, tramping up the gangway to circle the core. Radiation sickness, they tell themselves, is a little like being kissed in a bar by a beautiful woman. A little giddiness, a fear of what comes next. Ever vigilant, they wear regulation latex to stave off the worst excesses. Tahar Rahim gives a rumpled, compelling performance as Gary, an unschooled McJobber who takes a gig as a decontamination sub-contractor, carted like cattle from one reactor to the next. The employees board at makeshift campsites behind the smokestacks and it is here that Gary slips into an ill-starred affair with Karole (Léa Seydoux), the libidinous fiancee of an alpha-male co-worker (Denis Menochet). At clocking-off time, the yarn has them scurrying off for moonlit trysts by the river, amid the bull-rushes, where the crickets chirp and the cellos croak. Grand Central, which screens in Un Certain Regard at this year's Cannes film festival, makes a great show of its blue-collar pedigree and wanton, boozy antics. The film has tobacco on its breath and sweat-rings at its armpits, although it's not as brawny as it would have us believe. The drama, we realise, is running a fever. That undigested romantic subplot has fogged its senses and weakened its knees. Rebecca Zlotowski's picture works best when it's at its most stark and unadorned, when it focuses on the dirty nuts and bolts near the nuclear core. Along the way, Grand Central lifts the lid on a high-stakes Catch-22 system in which employees have to keep their radiation levels down for fear of being laid off - a devastating sleight of hand that effectively makes the sub-contractors responsible for their own safety. Right near the end we see a contaminated woman being dragged into the green-zone: her body doused, her head forcibly shaved. The prognosis looks bleak. But wait - is this woman sobbing because she is scared of losing her life or scared of losing her job? Zlotowski, smartly, leaves us to decide that for ourselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/20/coalition-u-turn-nuclear-energy-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-20T17:29:00Z","webTitle":"Coalition makes U-turn on nuclear energy subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/20/coalition-u-turn-nuclear-energy-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/20/coalition-u-turn-nuclear-energy-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Ministers planning 'hidden subsidies' for nuclear power","bodyText":"Ministers are planning to subsidise nuclear power through electricity bills – despite their promises not to, a secret document seen by the Guardian reveals. The leaked document clearly lays out plans to use \"contracts for difference\" for nuclear energy, which would allow nuclear operators to reap higher prices for their energy than fossil fuel power stations. The plans will further inflame rows over energy policy and cause a political furore for the Liberal Democrats, who fought the general election firmly opposing an expansion of nuclear power. Fiona Hall, leader of the Lib Dem group in the European parliament with a special interest in energy, said she now had no doubt that the contract for difference was a subsidy. \"Industry on all sides believe this is a subsidy.\" She wants the UK court of auditors as well as the European commission to give a legal ruling on the issue and believes any subsidy runs against the coalition agreement. In a blog posted on the Liberal Democrat Voice website she calls on fellow party members to \"speak out\" against nuclear subsidies. The issue is a key one for many Lib Dem supporters and has acquired even greater resonance since the Fukushima disaster and the withdrawal from nuclear of countries such as Germany and Italy. Green campaigners believe the Lib Dems have been persuaded into allowing higher energy bills to flow into increased profits for nuclear companies by a sleight of hand that lets ministers disguise nuclear subsidies as support for \"low-carbon power\". The Guardian has also seen a presentation made by Scottish &amp; Southern Energy to MPs last month, saying the plans contain \"hidden subsidies\", will be open to challenge on legal grounds, and could \"mess up\" funding for renewables. Hall commented: \"I have not seen the SSE presentation but even the nuclear industry accepts this is a covert subsidy.\" Green campaigners are threatening to bring a legal challenge when the plans are made public later in the year. The leaked document, a submission to the European commission, which the government has confirmed as genuine, says: \"Our reforms will put in place a regulatory framework based on feed-in tariffs for all low-carbon technologies, which will allow younger technologies to mature so that in the near- to mid-term future they will be able to compete in the open market … in time, we expect that this regulatory framework will enable different low-carbon technologies to compete against each other on a level playing field for their appropriate role in the energy mix.\" This is the clearest evidence yet of government plans to subsidise nuclear power through the back door, by classifying it with renewables as \"low-carbon power\", despite repeated assurances that there would be no public subsidy. In the coalition agreement subsidies to nuclear are explicitly ruled out. It said: \"Liberal Democrats have long opposed any new nuclear construction. Conservatives, by contrast, are committed to allowing the replacement of existing nuclear power stations provided that they are subject to the normal planning process for major projects (under a new National Planning Statement), and also provided that they receive no public subsidy.\" The government is already facing a crisis over its hopes for a fleet of new reactors to replace ageing generators. This week French company GDF Suez warned it would need increased financial incentives, including a strengthened price on carbon dioxide, to go ahead with its building plans. This followed the shock cancellation by German companies E.ON and RWE npower, partners in the Horizon consortium, of their plans to build new plants at Wylfa, Wales and Oldbury, Gloucestershire. Ministers apparently plan to argue that the proposed support system is not a direct subsidy and does not favour nuclear but puts it on the same footing as other forms of low-carbon energy – chiefly renewables, which will also receive a feed-in tariff. A top official from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) told the Guardian: \"We have made it very clear that this is about low-carbon energy in total. This is not a subsidy for nuclear power.\" But the plans are likely to come under severe attack in the European parliament. The Guardian understands that the Greens in Europe are preparing to take legal action against the government, arguing that the plans amount to state aid for nuclear. Claude Turmes, a leading Green in the European parliament, told the Guardian: \"We think these plans for feed-in tariffs for nuclear are state aid for nuclear power, which would not be allowed. We are looking at this very closely and we are going to fight this.\" The Decc official said: \"We don't think it should be seen as state aid and are in discussion with the commission on that.\" Within the energy industry the plans are also controversial. The Scottish &amp; Southern Energy presentation firmly labels the government's nuclear plans as \"subsidy\". In the presentation MPs were told the government was bringing the changes in as it needed to \"hide the subsidy\" to avoid a furore. SSE noted the plans would have to \"clear state aid [rules], yet subsidy for a mature technology like nuclear is a likely stumbling block with the commission\" and accused the government of trying to hide this. SSE said: \"We are concerned because if a nuclear subsidy messes up renewable support [there will be] massive uncertainty in our core market.\" A spokesman for SSE said: \"It is unclear what subsidy is required to make investment in new nuclear work. What the UK needs is an honest debate about the level of subsidy required, the mechanism for providing it, and why consumers should pay for it. If we decide that nuclear does need a subsidy it must be transparent how this is being provided and not be done in a way that damages investment in essential new renewable generation.\" The government believes its plans do not amount to state aid or subsidy. \"This is purely in the context of reforming the electricity market, which we have said clearly is needed to give investors long-term certainty that this will encourage new build of low-carbon energy infrastructure,\" said the DECC official. A senior figure in the renewable energy industry told the Guardian that haggling over the state aid rules for nuclear would spell delays to the market reforms, and therefore create confusion for investors in the renewables industry, which could hurt the UK's ability to meet renewable energy targets. The \"feed-in tariffs\" referred to in the leaked submission are not the same as the feed-in tariffs by which households can gain extra income by installing solar panels. Domestic feed-in tariffs, which were slashed last year in a manner that was ruled illegal in key respects by the courts, require energy utilities to pay those who generate solar power a fixed price, in excess of the normal electricity price. But for nuclear power, the feed-in tariffs would take the form instead of a complex system known as \"contracts for difference\". Under this arrangement, the government allows energy companies to sign long-term contracts, which would prioritise the purchasing of low-carbon power, though would not necessarily offer much of a premium compared with the standard electricity price. The attraction is that the long-term certainty these contracts provide makes it easier for investors to plan. These contracts – details of which will be set out later this year, to come into force from 2014 – have not been used in the UK before, and some energy experts are concerned that their complexity will make them difficult to work in practice, or that they may distort the market unfairly and result in higher bills."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2014/aug/21/john-ellis-roberts","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-21T14:16:20Z","webTitle":"John Ellis Roberts obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/21/john-ellis-roberts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2014/aug/21/john-ellis-roberts","fields":{"headline":"John Ellis Roberts obituary","bodyText":"John Ellis Roberts, who has died aged 70 in a climbing accident, was for more than three decades head warden of the Snowdonia national park, and a prime mover in setting the mountain rescue organisation in north Wales on a more professional footing. In 1965, he qualified as a mountain guide and was appointed to the Snowdonia post. Recreational pressure was growing on the mountains of north Wales, and he oversaw the development of a warden service that was a model of its kind. He was a pioneer in maintaining and improving footpaths on the more popular mountains – work that at the time was resisted by an elitist mountaineering establishment, who argued that it made summit access too easy for the unaware masses. In seeking to protect the physical fabric of the hills from erosion, John could be found out on the hillsides in all weathers directing, demonstrating and labouring with the footpath maintenance gangs. The great finger stones raised to mark the Watkin path and Miners' track descents from the summit of Snowdon, invaluable to the inexperienced, were his idea. He also negotiated access with local farmers, who were often resentful of weekenders' careless ways. John was brought up in the slate town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, his mother a staunch chapel goer, his father and grandfather both quarrymen. A monthly treat as a child was to be taken up to his father's place of work, where the message was adamantly put over: \"I don't want you to come up here to work.\" On leaving the town's grammar school, John became a junior draughtsman at nearby Trawsfynydd nuclear power station – a job that provided him with the means to pursue his interest in mountaineering. He had started climbing early, exploring the innumerable crags of his home ground. The work at Trawsfynydd and later for the Welsh Water Authority enabled him to travel to more distant hills, including the Alps. He became a more than proficient skier who delighted in leading parties along the Haute Route from France to Switzerland. He used the Snowdon post to argue long and hard that the rescue services should evolve from ad hoc and voluntary groups into well-trained and equipped staff working from permanent bases. It was a field in which he was very proficient: I remember the 1974 rescue of an injured man from the crevassed stance on Longland's Climb, 400ft up the forbidding precipice of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu on the north flank of Snowdon, which he conducted under hazardous conditions with breathtaking efficiency. He was the first in Wales to follow the example of Hamish MacInnes of Glencoe, in training and using dogs for mountain search and rescue operations. John's first rescue dog, Bonn – a highly intelligent German shepherd – came to him as gift from Hamish in 1966, and proved her worth almost immediately by finding alive a woman lost for several January days in the Eifionydd hills. John's inventiveness in tailoring equipment to the task helped not only in rescuing people but also in recovering innumerable crag-fast sheep (the device he invented for this is still called the Roberts bag). In 1976 he was made MBE. He retired in 1999 and was able to devote more time to mountain activities with his partner, Tracey Evans, who survives him. A first marriage, to Bronwen, ended in divorce. • John Ellis Roberts, mountaineer, born 6 August 1943; died 17 July 2014"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2014/may/15/godzilla-review-scary-monsters-boring-humans","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-15T13:59:00Z","webTitle":"Godzilla review – big, scary monsters but no bite in satire-stripped remake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/15/godzilla-review-scary-monsters-boring-humans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/may/15/godzilla-review-scary-monsters-boring-humans","fields":{"headline":"Godzilla review – big, scary monsters but no bite in satire-stripped remake","bodyText":"Godzilla is back, for the first time in English since Roland Emmerich's blockbuster in 1998. The terrifying gigantic lizard has re-emerged from the oceans to menace the Pacific Rim in its entirety, sending everything flying in a shower of pixels. British director Gareth Edwards supervises some colossal creature-feature effects, but the human beings are on fantastically dull form and the storyline is a muddled and supercilious affair in which Godzilla may or not be the villain, fighting two other lesser CGI beasts. Of course, Godzilla has form in battling other monsters, but for me, it puts the humans in danger of being mere collateral damage, looking and feeling irrelevant in this great big skyscraper-wrecking punch-up of the mega-behemoths. More exasperatingly, the anti-nuclear satire of the original Japanese movie has been insidiously softened. In this film, it's not at all clear that nuclear power is really to blame for the terrifying eruption. This Godzilla is sitting on the nuke fence. Godzilla, like James Bond, was a 1950s fantasy phenomenon which grew out of national anxiety. The 1954 movie Gojira, about a sea monster summoned from the deep by nuclear tests to lay waste to Tokyo was a potent myth and a brilliant, Swiftian satire. The Brobdingnagian lizard allowed the Japanese to remember and reimagine the monstrous nuclear destruction of the war without the shame of military defeat, and then to confront the whole world with it: Godzilla told us that the nuclear age was not scientific or technological, but irrational and uncontrollable, a grotesque symptom of hubris, with the potential to amplify the smallest spasms of aggression to gigantic levels of annihilation. This new Godzilla erupts from a modern catastrophe involving a Japanese nuclear power station that resembles Fukushima. Or does it? A strange narrative sleight of hand associates Godzilla with nuclear calamity but muddies the actual causal relationship. There's a new slant on that black-and-white newsreel footage of 1950s nuclear tests, which is ingenious, but weirdly comes close to making the nukes the heroes. It seems the monsters may fortuitously \"feed on\" nuclear energy, but the mighty blast of a good old-fashioned A-bomb might be what's needed to get rid of them. Or we could let Godzilla do the job and become bystanders. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays a young soldier, Ford Brody – a name Douglas Adams would have been proud to have invented. He is haunted by a personal demon, a big lizard of emotional pain lurking in the ocean of memory. Fifteen years earlier, his dad, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), was involved at the quasi-Fukushima disaster, where he was a top nuclear scientist, working with a single-minded intensity that threatened his marriage to Sandra (a slightly preposterous role for Juliette Binoche). Now Cranston has become a lonely conspiracy theorist, obsessed with what the authorities are covering up. This brings him and Ford into contact with the existing top nuclear scientists, Dr Serizawa, played by Ken Watanabe – inevitably wasted in this bland role – and his assistant, Vivienne, played by Sally Hawkins, who does a bit of frowning, nodding and stammering like a character in a Mike Leigh film. So what are they up against? Well, at first, the demon from the depths is not Godzilla himself but something the army is calling a MUTO – a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism. (Massive? Isn't that what Godzilla was supposed to be?) Unlike Godzilla, they don't get a name, just this acronym. The MUTO looks like a spider-pterodactyl with a face like one of the eagles atop New York's Chrysler Building, and there's more than one of them – one has what looks like a womb full of glowing eggs, or possibly a huge scrotum fill of glowing sperm. They could breed. Godzilla couldn't have turned up at a more dramatic moment. So should the US army blast all three of them to hell? Or gamble on Godzilla's potential for decency and let him deal with the MUTOs – which would be the ecologically correct, giant-lizard-hugging thing to do? It all gets very tiresome, with dispiriting hints of Pacific Rim and the lumbering Transformers movies. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, so likable in the Kick-Ass films, is here dull and slow-moving beefcake. There's an awful moment when he hears the MUTO roar from afar and does an am-dram face and slooow turn, as if to say: \"Oh my God, that's not a towering lizard behind me is it?\" His demure wife, Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), is a hospital doctor, which means she doesn't get to do anything more than look fetching in green scrubs and watch the monster on wall-mounted TVs while the casualties pour in. The sleep of reason brings forth monsters, they say. Sadly these monsters may bring forth sleep themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2013/dec/02/scientists-policy-governments-science","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-02T13:29:07Z","webTitle":"Top 20 things scientists need to know about policy-making | Chris Tyler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/02/scientists-policy-governments-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2013/dec/02/scientists-policy-governments-science","fields":{"headline":"Top 20 things scientists need to know about policy-making","bodyText":"When scientists moan about how little politicians know about science, I usually get annoyed. Such grouching is almost always counterproductive and more often than not betrays how little scientists know about the UK's governance structures, processes, culture and history. So when the Guardian reported on a Nature article that listed 20 things that politicians should know about science, I started reading it with apprehension, half expecting my head to explode within a few paragraphs. I needn't have worried. The authors, Professors William Sutherland, David Spiegelhalter and Mark Burgman, have produced a list that picks up on many of the challenges that scientists report when engaging with policy makers, and it does so in a constructive way. It has been printed out and stuck on my wall. It has been passed around the office. I am sure to reference it often. But the fact remains that all too often, scientists blame politicians for failures when science meets policy-making, when in truth the science community needs to do much more to engage productively with the people who actually make policy. There are similarities with long-standing and successful efforts to improve the relationship between science and the media. Fiona Fox, the director of the Science Media Centre, has repeatedly and correctly asserted that \"the media will 'do' science better when scientists 'do' the media better\". I believe that the same is true of science-policy connections. So here is a list of 20 things that I and my fellow science advisers at the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology think scientists should know about policy. We knocked up the list in just an afternoon last week but it should stimulate debate, and if anyone were to print it out and stick it on their wall or pass it round their labs, it probably wouldn't do any harm. Here we go, in no particular order … 1. Making policy is really difficult The most common science rant about policy making includes a flippant comment about policy decisions being straightforward. I've heard people say that it is \"obvious\" that the UK should decriminalise drugs; stimulate the economy by doubling the science budget; reform our energy economy by investing extensively in nuclear. Such decisions are not straightforward at all. Public policy is always more complex than it seems, involving a wide range of inputs, complicated interactions with other policies, and varied and unpredictable outcomes. Simple solutions to complex problems are rarer than most people think. 2. No policy will ever be perfect Whatever the decision, the effects of policy are almost always uneven. For example, any changes to taxes and benefits will leave some people better off and other worse off; and while the research impact agenda has been undoubtedly positive in some respects, it has caused problems in others. 3. Policy makers can be expert too Scientists often consider themselves as the \"experts\" who engage with policy makers. In my experience, many policy makers are experts too. Some have excellent research credentials, and frequently they understand the research base well. When I worked at the University of Cambridge, one of my jobs was to connect researchers to policy makers; the researchers often told me how much they learned from speaking to policy makers. In other words, if you are a scientist talking to a policy maker, don't assume that you are the only expert in the room. 4. Policy makers are not a homogenous group \"Policy maker\" is at least as broad a term as \"researcher\". It includes civil servants ranging from senior to junior, generalist to specialist, and to those in connected agencies and regional government; it includes politicians in government and opposition, in the Commons and the Lords; and then there are all the people who might not directly make the decisions, but as advisers can strongly influence them. 5. Policy makers are people too See number 12 of the Sutherland, Spiegelhalter and Burgman list. Policy makers are people who, despite extensive training and the best of intentions, will sometimes make bad decisions and get things wrong. Also, they may – like scientists – choose to act in their own interest … 6. Policy decisions are subject to extensive scrutiny … which is why, like science – which mitigates human nature insofar as it is possible with the principles of academic rigour and peer review – policy is regulated by professional guidelines, a variety of checks and balances, and scrutiny that comes from a wide range of institutions and angles. For example, Parliament scrutinises government and the House of Lords scrutinises the House of Commons. 7. Starting policies from scratch is very rarely an option A former government minister once told me that, on taking office, he decided to meet with a number of academics to seek advice on how to fix his particular policy domain – which was, and still is, largely broken. He found the experience to be deeply frustrating because everyone he met said: well, if you were designing the system from scratch, this is what it should look like. But he wasn't; he needed solutions that could evolve from within the existing ecosystem. This rule applies in a lot of policy areas, from infrastructure to education, from the NHS to pensions. 8. There is more to policy than scientific evidence Policies are not made in isolation. First there is a starting point in current policy, and there are usually some complex interactions between policies at different regional scales: local, national and international. This is true of policy areas such as drugs, defence, immigration and banking regulations. Law, economics, politics and public opinion are all important factors; scientific evidence is only part of the picture that a policy maker has to consider. Most of the major policy areas that consistently draw opprobrium from scientists are far more complicated than just scientific evidence: energy, drugs and health, to name just three. 9. Economics and law are top dogs in policy advice When it comes to advice sought by policy makers, economics and law are top dogs. Scientific evidence comes further down the pecking order. Whether or not this is the best way to make policy is not the point, it is just a statement of how things work in practice. 10. Public opinion matters Many of the most important public policy decisions are made by people who were directly elected, and most of the rest are taken by people who work for them. We live in a democracy and public opinion is a critical component of the policy process. The public is directly involved in many planning decisions and public opinion is a consideration in the distribution of healthcare providers, schools and transport services. Complex policy areas such as drugs, alcohol, immigration and education, are all heavily influenced by public opinion. 11. Policy makers do understand uncertainty It is commonly asserted by scientists that policy makers prefer to be given information that is certain, and I have even heard some say that policy makers don't understand uncertainty. On the contrary: politicians are surrounded by and constantly make formal and informal assessments of uncertainty (for example, when considering polling information) and civil servants are expert at drawing up policy options with incomplete information (which is just as well because complete information is a fantasy). It is true to say that policy makers are not fond of information so laden with caveats that it is useless. Better than hazy comments about policy makers not understanding uncertainty, the Sutherland, Spiegelhalter and Burgman list is a productive explanation of what knowledge and skills would help policy makers. 12. Parliament and government are different In the UK, the distinction between parliament and government is profound. Parliament – the legislature – debates public issues, makes laws and scrutinises government. Government – the executive – is led by select members of parliament and is responsible for designing and implementing policy. Parliament is made up of over a thousand MPs and peers, with a small staff of only a few thousand. Government is made up of only a hundred MPs and peers, with a staff of hundreds of thousands. For the record, I work in parliament. 13. Policy and politics are not the same thing Policy is mostly about the design and implementation of a particular intervention. Politics is about how the decision was made. Policy is mostly determined in government, where the politics is focused by ministers, the cabinet, and the party leadership. In the House of Commons, there is less policy and more politics. 14. The UK has a brilliant science advisory system The UK is leading the world with its science advisory system. Every government department has (in theory) a chief scientific adviser reporting to his or her own private secretary (the top departmental civil servant) and to the government chief scientific adviser, who reports directly to the prime minister. In parliament, we have the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, and in addition science advisers in the library research services and select committee offices. 15. Policy and science operate on different timescales When policy makers say that they need information soon, they mean within days or weeks, not months. This is not a flaw of the system; it is the way it is. If scientists want to engage with policy they need to be able to work to policy makers' schedule. Asking policy makers to work to a slower timetable will result in them going elsewhere for advice. And make your advice concise. 16. There is no such thing as a policy cycle I have seen many flow charts depicting \"the policy cycle\". They usually start with an idea, move through a sequence of research, design, implementation and evaluation, which then feeds back into the start of the cycle. Fine in theory, but in practice it is a lot more complicated. Policy making is iterative; the art of the possible. 17. The art of making policy is a developing science We live in exciting times for policy making. Various initiatives for better governance are under way, including ones for opening up the policy making process, and others for building evaluation into policy implementation. The new What Works Centres are roughly based on Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the healthcare body that recommends which treatments the NHS should use), but instead it will consider how to reduce crime, stimulate local economic growth, promote better ageing and use early intervention better. Research evidence, particularly from the social sciences, will play a key role. In another innovation, the Cabinet Office is set to establish a Policy Lab. 18. 'Science policy' isn't a thing When policy makers talk about \"science policy\", they are usually talking about policies for things like research funding, universities and innovation policy. Researchers additionally use \"science policy\" to talk about the use of research evidence to help deliver better policies in a wide range of areas. I find it helps to distinguish between \"policy for science\" on the one hand, and \"science for policy\" on the other. 19. Policy makers aren't interested in science per se Well some are, but on the whole, policy for science is pretty niche. Policy makers tend to be more interested in research evidence to inform policy making, but let's be clear: they are not interested in philosophical conversations such as \"what constitutes evidence\" or \"the difference between science advice, social science advice and engineering advice\". Policy makers care about research evidence insofar as it helps them to make better decisions. 20. 'We need more research' is the wrong answer Policy decisions usually need to be made pretty quickly, and asking for more time and money to conduct research is unlikely to go down well. Policy makers have to make decisions with incomplete information (see #11) so they may exhibit frustration with researchers who are unable to offer an opinion without first obtaining funding for a multi-year research programme. I'm not saying that more research isn't often needed; it is. But it is not the answer I would ever choose to give to a policy maker seeking scientific advice.

The IMF said the benefits of debt-financed infrastructure projects could give an important boost to economic growth especially when the world is threatened by a long period of stagnation. In documents released before its revised economic outlook, it urged governments to examine where infrastructure investments could benefit longer-term growth. It said: “Debt-financed projects could have large output effects without increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio, if clearly identified needs are met through efficient investment. In other words, public infrastructure investment could pay for itself if done correctly.” The report singles out the US and Germany as in need of large-scale infrastructure investment following a stream of critical reports from the business community over the upkeep of road and rail networks. It says the US needs to act to arrest the decline in its network of roads. “As the American Society of Civil Engineers notes, 32% of major roads in the US are now in poor or mediocre condition, and the US Federal Highway Administration estimates that between $124bn [£76bn] and $146bn annually in capital investment will be needed for substantial improvement in conditions and performance – considerably more than the $100bn spent on capital improvements at all government levels,” it said. George Osborne is likely to take some comfort from the analysis, which brackets the UK with Canada, Italy, France and Japan as having an improving level of infrastructure, “albeit from relatively low levels”. The IMF, which acts as lender of last resort to struggling countries, has been a keen supporter of infrastructure investment since the financial crash as a way to boost employment and increase productivity. Better roads and rail, digital infrastructure and power networks support local businesses and help them increase output at lower costs. However, in its most recent study it is more circumspect with its recommendation, cautioning governments to make an assessment of how good they are at implementing large-scale projects. It warns that many infrastructure projects can be bedevilled by a lack of competence and duplication of effort that leads to cost overruns. A debate over the relative merits of private versus public investment is made difficult in developing countries by a lack of reliable information, but it is clear that in developed countries public investment can provide much-needed infrastructure projects alongside the private sector, it says. Even the massive public spending by Japan in the 1990s to counter the recession of the late 1980s, which has been much derided in rightwing circles, is defended in the report, which says it made a positive contribution to GDP growth and provided a platform for investment and productivity gains. The report spares Germany the embarrassment of highlighting some of its recent failures, though it could have pointed to the much delayed and still not completed Berlin international airport and the threat of an energy crisis in the next decade when a generation of nuclear power stations are due to be switched off. In a separate report, the IMF highlights how the large imbalances in the world economy have reduced in the five years since the financial crash, but have left the world economy vulnerable to further shocks and trapped some countries into a period of low growth. It welcomes the halving of the US deficit with China and the halving of the surpluses racked up each year by China and Japan from trade and investments abroad. It says these welcome developments could be reversed in the next few years because many countries have reduced their reliance on imports by depressing internal domestic consumption. Spain, Greece and many European countries have reduced their balance of payments deficits following a sharp cut in demand. A recovery in the domestic consumption of foreign goods and services could generate a rise in imbalances again unless those countries affected change their behaviour. The report also points out that imbalances have shrunk, but not reversed, leaving some countries that grew quickly following a large inflow of funds to suffer even bigger deficits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/2014/sep/11/the-real-cost-of-shutting-off-power","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-11T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"The real cost of shutting off power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/2014/sep/11/the-real-cost-of-shutting-off-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/2014/sep/11/the-real-cost-of-shutting-off-power","fields":{"headline":"The real cost of shutting off power","bodyText":"Dr Andrew McDermott, technical director of the British Ceramic Confederation, is worried about what will happen to the British businesses supplying bricks to the construction industry if their energy source is suddenly cut off. “We’re an energy-intensive sector – we’re mainly gas-intensive but we use an awful lot of electricity as well. Our members have fears regarding security of supply,” he says. His fears are not unrealistic. The UK faces an energy crisis with a narrowing gap between available supply and rising demand. With political unrest in Ukraine and the wider Middle East, the country cannot rely on an uninterrupted supply of gas from its usual sources. McDermott explains: “A significant proportion of European gas comes from Russia and a significant proportion of that transports across Ukraine. That has an impact on gas availability in mainland Europe, and because we’re linked to that it could see the UK affected as well.” Manufacturers of bricks and roof tiles, registered as major energy consumers, cannot shut down operations at short notice without causing expensive damage to their kilns – but when supplies start to run low, that’s exactly what could happen. “That’s the disconnection order… if anything happens, they’re among the first to go,” McDermott says. Political psychology Laura El-Katiri, research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, says political psychology is having a big impact on energy supply in the UK. “Obviously geopolitics plays a big role in energy markets, not only because [countries] can restrict supplies but also because of the psychology of the market,” she says. Energy policies, says El-Katiri, are highly complex, and abruptly changing direction is likely to be an even higher stakes game for politicians than for industrial consumers. “Saying simply ‘let’s move from a cleaner fuel, such as gas, to a more polluting fuel, such as coal, just because there is a crisis in Ukraine’ – well, that’s very dangerous,” she says. This type of kneejerk reaction, she suggests, could result in a government failing to balance the broader future fuel needs of its country. So whose job is it to plan for energy security: government, business or supplier? EDF Energy, one of the “big six” British energy suppliers, is taking on the mantle. Chief executive Vincent de Rivaz says it’s up to energy companies “with a view of the whole system” to ensure there is enough available. To tackle the problem at home, EDF is focusing its investment on extending the lives of 15 existing British nuclear reactors, as well as a new generation of nuclear power stations at Hinkley Point in Somerset. But businesses are making their own plans, too. “We are constantly thinking about how we best manage our exposure to the uncertainties of the energy market,” says Marcel Galjee, director of energy for AkzoNobel, the world’s largest manufacturer of powder coatings. “Our strategy in general terms is to achieve an ever-greater diversification in our energy mix, to move away from natural gas and other fossil fuels and to integrate more renewable sources. This strategy has as much to do with the uncertainties of geopolitics as it does our commitment to sustainability and basic economics.” But though governments may pay the political price if their calculations to ensure energy security go wrong, companies will take massive financial hits if the juice gets cut off, which may, in turn, lead to job losses. And without firm assurances of a secure supply, investors may also be chary of further committing themselves to UK business – so ensuring the kilns keep firing the bricks is very firmly at the top of policymakers’ agenda.

As regulator for the nuclear industry in the UK we identified some key lessons to take from this devastating incident. They are: the need for a systematic approach to identifying events that could lead to accidents; robust measures to prevent those events progressing this far; and effective periodic review of safety analyses, to make sure they continue to meet high and continuously evolving regulatory standards. Fortunately, the UK acknowledged these requirements over 20 years ago and they were codified by the Office for Nuclear Regulation in its site licence conditions and safety assessment principles. Companies proposing the construction of new nuclear power stations in the UK must show they will meet these requirements and address specific issues identified in the chief nuclear inspector's reports on the Fukushima accident. More information on these publications and the generic design assessment process for new reactor designs is available on our website (www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/). Andy Hall First deputy chief inspector, Office for Nuclear Regulation • Welcome as Tepco president Naomi Hirose's admission of the seriousness of the Fukushima accident is (Editorial, 21 November), it may be a bit naive to accept that the whole accident was down to a lack of seals on doors. There were reports early on – denied by Tepco, but then so were many things that we now know were true – that at least one of the reactors lost cooling as a result of a pipe fracture caused by the earthquake and not the tsunami. With or without the rubber seals, the lack of nitrogen-purging equipment, which led to the hydrogen explosions, was a major failure in the \"in-depth\" safety strategy. A taste of the attitude of \"nuclear insiders\" at the time comes from a report of a conference in Chicago one month after the accident headed: \"Fukushima – a PR problem soon to fade from public attention?\" I suppose we must be grateful for the question mark. Nuclear propagandists, including some quoted in this newspaper, insist there will be practically no health consequences from the accident, but they misrepresent the evidence, insisting that at doses below 100 millisieverts [mSv] risk can be neglected. This, as the study of the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan has shown, is not the case: risk is proportional to dose from a threshold at zero dose to 2 Sv. This misrepresentation permits a policy of indefinite duration, endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that allows children to live with an annual external dose up to 20 mSv and which I calculate would increase the lifetime cancer risk of a child by up to 7% over a decade. Perhaps the question is: is the nuclear industry sufficiently responsible to manage the technology? Keith Baverstock Department of environmental sciences, University of Eastern Finland • Your editorial was a reminder of the sad events associated with Fukushima Daiichi and the undeniable challenges associated with the cleanup programme. Perspective and context are, however, important. In his recent review (8 November) of Robert Stone's film Pandora's Promise, which relays an environmentalist view on the arguments for embracing nuclear power, Damian Carrington observed of the concerns regarding safety: \"As it happens, I think these concerns are overblown too. The harm to human health resulting from nuclear power is tiny compared to other energy sources, principally coal. The cancers caused by leaks from nuclear power stations are small in number compared to the deaths resulting from the air pollution caused by fossil fuel burning.\" The safety record of the global nuclear industry is undeniably better than that of just about any other energy-generating technology. The seriousness with which governments and regulators internationally took their responsibility post-Fukushima in ensuring the safety of operating power plants is commendable. It is this culture that drives the design of current and future-generation nuclear power stations that will be deployed in the UK; enhanced safety and greater resistance to external environmental influences have been key. The one thing the planet cannot afford is climate change. If current projections are anything like right, it is in a different league from any other environmental problem imaginable. Until it is possible to store electricity on a much greater scale than today, variable renewables are not able to provide the reliable electricity we need day in day out, which never falls below about 20,000MW in the UK. So it's coal, gas or nuclear for this segment of our power demand. Unless carbon capture and storage really takes off – and even then it does not eliminate carbon emissions from fossil fuel use – the choice is simply nuclear power or high greenhouse gas emissions.

Imagine sitting on the board of HMV in 2000, laying down plans for a major investment in new, high-street megastores which – unbeknown to you – will shortly have their revenue base pulled from under their feet. That boardroom is where we are with the UK government’s energy policy. The iTunes of the energy sector is solar power and batteries. The costs of solar panels are tumbling and solar-generated electricity is already the same price as electricity bought from the grid in most sunny countries in the world. Citibank has projected that solar will reach so-called grid parity in the UK as soon as 2020. The Wall Street analyst Sanford Bernstein predicts that within a decade solar will have fundamentally transformed the nature of energy markets across the globe as its costs continue to fall. Cost reductions in batteries support rapid advances in solar because batteries can store solar-generated electricity and enable it to be used when the sun isn’t shining. Barclays predicts that solar and battery combinations will reach grid parity for 20% of US consumers in four years. After the iPod came the iPhone. In the energy sector, we have smart technologies that integrate digital and communication tools into devices such as meters, thermostats, appliances and lights, enabling demand for electricity to be managed and reduced in real-time. These technologies can substantially increase the efficiency with which electricity is used and produce significant reductions in bills. The smart energy technology sector includes some of the world’s biggest technology companies including Google and, of course, Apple. The record stores in the metaphor are the utility companies; their centralised business models, based on large-scale fossil-fuel power stations, are being undercut by solar, batteries and smart technologies as well as by other new technologies such as onshore wind. The value of the largest 20 utilities in Europe has been cut in half over the past six years owing to the current and projected impacts of these new technologies. At the same time the credit ratings of utilities across the world are being downgraded. Our government should be seizing the opportunity from these new technologies. This requires major reforms to how the energy system operates and is regulated, so that they can compete on a level playing field. For example, the networks that are used to transport electricity were constructed to support large-scale forms of generation, and not to integrate small-scale solar and onshore wind or smart technologies that adjust when there is demand for power. Instead, as our new report shows, the government is focused on supporting large-scale generation technologies, on which the dying traditional utility model is based. The government plans to levy £7.6bn a year from energy bills by 2020 to fund investments in low carbon generation. But it is prioritising nuclear power and offshore wind farms while restricting investments in solar and smart technologies. We need nuclear and offshore wind power but not to the exclusion of the new distributed technologies. Developments in solar, onshore wind, batteries and smart technologies give us reason for great optimism. They hold the key to a cheaper, cleaner and more competitive energy system that works better for consumers. But they are being held back by policy that is proppoing up the large scale utility business model. It is time to break with the past and embrace the brighter future that these technologies offer.

The Princeton report, published on the Arms Control Today website, focuses on the core issue that has proved most problematic in the four months of talks so far - Iran's future capacity for enriching uranium. This has hitherto been such a gap to bridge because Iran and the West come at it from entirely different perspectives. The West is concentrating on limiting Iran's breakout time - how long it would take Iran to enrich enough weapons-grade uranium to make a bomb. It would like to see a breakout capacity of a year or so, with the idea that would give plenty of warning if Tehran decided to junk its legal non-proliferation obligations and make a dash for a warhead. On those calculations, the upper ceiling for capacity would be a few thousand uranium-enriching centrifuges. That would represent a sharp reduction from its current total of 19,000 installed machines, ten thousand of which are operating. Iran views its capacity needs in terms of long-term energy and research needs. It says it wants to free itself from total reliance on oil and gas, for environmental and long-term planning reasons, and expand its ability to produce isotopes for medical, industrial and agricultural uses. So it needs a capacity measured in tens of thousands of centrifuges to supply the many power stations it says it wants to build, and it does not want to be dependent on foreign supply, as is presently case for its Russian-built, Russian-fuelled nuclear power station in Bushehr. The Princeton compromise is a two-stage approach, allowing a very limited enrichment capacity for the existing research reactor in Tehran in the short term, but with the flexibility to expand that capacity to keep pace with the construction of future nuclear power stations in the long term. The existing contract for Russian nuclear fuel rods for Bushehr expires in 2021. If Tehran decides it wants to use it own rods after that, then its enrichment capacity would be stepped up as that deadline approaches, but not before 2019. In the intervening five years, Iran would focus on modernising its enrichment plant, replacing the now ancient and inefficient IR-1 centrifuges, based on half-century old technology, with a new generation of IR-2m centrifuges, with about five times the capacity. As the new machines were installed in this first phase, total capacity would remain the same. Even more advanced centrifuges would be developed with an eye to the future. To reassure the international community Iran was not diverting new centrifuges to some covert site intended for weapon-grade enrichment, it would stockpile them in their component pieces under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It would take at least six months to put them together and get them working properly, the authors reckon. Iran would meanwhile abide by the transparency arrangements it agreed in the Joint Plan of Action with six world powers in November, giving the IAEA access to its centrifuge-making workshops and storage facilities. Finally, Iran and the six powers would use the five year first phase to negotiate a multinational consortium which would enrich nuclear fuel for the entire region under strict international safeguards. The obvious problem with this plan is that in the second phase, Iran would have an enrichment capacity least ten times greater than its current level, capable of churning out tens of bombs-worth of weapons-grade uranium per year if diverted to that purpose. The Princeton authors' solution is to establish a permanent transparency regime for centrifuge production, so the IAEA will always know where every centrifuge is, and to work on setting up a regional enrichment consortium. In effect, then, the problem is kicked down the road in the hope that a much-enhanced atmosphere would be more conducive to ambitious multilateral arrangements that currently seem beyond reach. A large dose of wishful thinking has been factored in. There is also a school of thought that any approach based primarily on breakout times is misjudged. Jeffrey Lewis. at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, argues that if Tehran was going to cheat the system and build a bomb secretly, it would not do it with its officially declared enrichment capacity, which is under IAEA safeguards. To do so would instantly trigger a pre-emptive strike from the US or Israel. Instead, it would seek to build up a covert capacity away from the world's gaze. In an article in Foreign Policy, Lewis argues: Having a significant quantity of highly enriched uranium sitting around isn't a deterrent -- it is an invitation to preemption...Let me put this simply: Even if the Iranians build a bomb, they are likely to pretend for a prolonged time that they haven't. Imposing limits on the number, capability, or operation of Iran's centrifuges is a fool's errand. It is far more important to win concessions on verification and access to Iran's nuclear program. The trouble with this approach is that, in circumstances where Iran has a large enrichment capacity and a short breakout time, any glitch in a monitoring and verification programme could be enormously significant. But glitches can also happen for more innocent reasons, falling out over details and protocols and a whole array of misunderstandings. The world would be an uncertain hair trigger. Little wonder the talks have been so slow going, and little wonder there is already a lot of chatter about going into extra time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/nov/01/patricia-cornwell-i-grew-up-with-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-01T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Patricia Cornwell: ‘I grew up with fear’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/01/patricia-cornwell-i-grew-up-with-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/nov/01/patricia-cornwell-i-grew-up-with-fear","fields":{"headline":"Patricia Cornwell: ‘I grew up with fear’","bodyText":"Bad things happen to good people. That’s what I learn from Patricia Cornwell’s latest novel, Depraved Heart, the 23rd she’s written featuring Dr Kay Scarpetta, the cool-headed, genre-busting forensic pathologist Cornwell invented back in 1990 before forensic pathology – and CSI – had colonised all TV schedules. Sometimes really bad things. That’s what else I learn: that when psychopaths are involved, you start thinking in italics. A lot. But then, it would be easy to treat Patricia Cornwell with a certain amount of italicised irony. The website Gawker, in describing her, suggested that “The world needs more out lesbian true-crime authors who pilot helicopters, are obsessed with Jack the Ripper and maintained a warm friendship with Billy Graham’s wife for many years.” She is all those things. A 59-year-old blonde-coiffed action woman with a strong southern accent and a rapid-fire delivery who does our entire interview in a wetsuit – a clone of one Scarpetta wore in the books. She is that rare mythical beast: a writer who makes money from books. Lots of money. So much money from the equally gung-ho Scarpetta, that she failed to notice for a long time that her accountants were in breach of fiduciary duty resulting in the 2013 federal jury verdict in Cornwell’s favour of many millions of dollars. She won a court case against them two years ago and was awarded $50.9m in damages, though it’s now under appeal. “I’m the first to point out that I’m not thrifty,” she says, though it hasn’t made much dent in her lifestyle. She still drives a Ferrari and pilots a helicopter and lives comfortably in Boston with her wife, Staci Gruber, a Harvard neuroscientist. Think of her as an older, feistier American version of JK Rowling with a set of motorbike leathers. I come to understand the italics. Because if her work majors in imagining creative new ways bad people will try and get you, it’s because bad people really have tried to come and get her. The latest Scarpetta stretches the envelope of credulity – not least because of the Byzantine back story that has to account for the plots of the last 22 novels – but Cornwell’s own story is far more compelling and terrifying, not least because it’s true. Why the particular interest in psychopaths, I want to know. Is it as a narrative device? “No, it’s fear,” says Cornwell. “It’s because I grew up with terrible fear. I grew up in such a frightening way.” She was just five when her father walked out of the family home in Florida on Christmas Day. But that was only the start: “You find you are wandering the streets by yourself in Miami because no one is looking after you. And then you get molested by a patrolman. “He started with the kissing and the touching and putting his hand in my pocket. He found a hole and he was just putting his finger through the hole when my brother rolled around on his bicycle. He was about to pull me into his car. We found out later that he was a convicted paedophile. I would probably have ended up in one of the canals down there. I would probably be dead.” Cornwell testified before a grand jury. Her mother, worrying about the safety of her children and having discovered the teachings of Billy Graham, moved Cornwell and her brothers to Graham’s home town in rural North Carolina. It was there that Cornwell says her mother started unravelling. She suffered a psychotic episode and was detained in a psychiatric hospital. “It was just terrifying seeing somebody destabilise in front of you when you’re nine years old.” During her mother’s illness, Cornwell was fostered by a woman who bullied and terrified her. Later, as a teenager, she suffered from severe anorexia. “A select few of us come into this world not bothered by gruesomeness,” says Scarpetta in the opening pages of Depraved Heart. “In fact, we’re drawn to it.” It’s not clear that Patricia Cornwell came into the world that way but she’s certainly learned it as she’s gone along. In her fiction, she invented a new genre: she revelled in the gory details, but through Scarpetta she expounded them in a cool, precise, scientific way. She respected the victims. And strove to bring them justice. In person, Cornwell has a similar openness and forthright demeanour. Maybe it’s the haircut, but I can’t help thinking there’s a touch of the Jane Fonda about her. “I will not be governed by fear,” she says. It’s her personal motto. And in book after book, she’s had Dr Kay Scarpetta – a blonde, blue-eyed alter ego – confront wrongdoers and expose abuses of power. A lot of novelists shy away from autobiographical interpretations of their work, and while Cornwell will point out all the ways they’re different (Scarpetta is a scientist, Cornwell adds up on her fingers) when I point out that she seems to be rewriting the past in her novels – only this time, making sure everything turns out all right – she agrees immediately. “Constantly. It’s exactly what I’m doing. I’m supposed to be writing my memoirs and I keep going, ‘I kind of already am. I do it in every book.’ That’s what artists do. We take things and filter it through us and it comes out in a different form.” Through Scarpetta, Cornwell has confronted her fears and overcome them. Within minutes of us meeting in an airy Boston apartment overlooking the waterfront, she’s demonstrating how she tested which knives Jack the Ripper might have used. Jack the Ripper has been a long-time obsession of Cornwell’s. A decade ago, she wrote a book in which she points the finger at Walter Sickert, a painter of the period. And the apartment, next to the home she and Staci share, is her “crime library”, filled with objects she’s gathered in the course of her search. There are all sorts of Ripper-related material and framed Sickerts and decades’ worth of original Times newspapers in bound volumes, as well as modern forensic kits and a human skeleton. “That’s her pal,” her sister-in-law Mary – who works for Cornwell – tells me. Knives, daggers and great curving swords are laid out across a table and Cornwell picks them up in turn to show them to me. “There are only a few pages of one autopsy report,” she says about the Ripper’s victims. “The big question is what inflicted the kind of injuries they had. So I went and bought all the different kinds of knives you’d have been able to buy in the period, and I would experiment to see what would be the most likely weapon that could cut through so many layers of clothing, the throat, disembowelling. I’m sorry,” she says and demonstrates by stabbing a dagger into the air. “But you have to think of these things. I experimented. I’d buy a big old piece of rump roast and wrap it in wool.” A what? “A big side of beef that you get in the grocery store. I would wrap it with fabric of the period and then try all this stuff, cutting into it,” she says She picks up a Victorian dagger from the table and demonstrates how Jack the Ripper might have cut open his victims. It’s this attention to detail – a dogged, quasi-scientific approach right down to dressing a dead cow in period materials and mutilating it – that is Cornwell’s hallmark. She started out as a journalist, but when she chose to try her hand at crime writing, she decided to do her research. For most people, this might be a site visit and an interview, but Cornwell wanted to know exactly what the forensic scientists did and how they did it. She visited a laboratory, “and I just thought: ‘Wow, there is so much to learn here.’ And I said: ‘I will do anything you will let me to be useful if you just let me hang around.’” She started out as a volunteer, but then took a permanent position and ended up working there for six years. Six years! “I didn’t set out to work there for six years. I honestly was so dumb, I thought when I got there I would do this for a few months and then write this great novel. Well, I wrote one and nobody wanted it. I wrote a second and nobody wanted it. I wrote the third and nobody wanted it. And then I went back to the newspaper to see if I could get a job. I thought: ‘You’ve really failed. Like usual. Loser, loser, loser.’ “Nobody was writing about that sort of stuff back then. I kept being told, nobody wants to read about laboratories or morgues. And a woman who does it? No, thank you! Wow. Well, I guess that turned out not to be true.” She sold the first one, Postmortem. And the rest is history, or at least CSI. Scarpetta was a pioneer. Now, in a neat turn of metafiction, the character grumbles her job has become harder because juries have watched too many TV shows. “I know,” says Cornwell. “I’m literally chasing my own tail. But Scarpetta just turned 25 and I can’t write the same thing now that I wrote in 1990. We don’t live in the same world. It’s not even similar.” It’s also made the characters an awful lot harder to write, I can’t help thinking. Lucy, Scarpetta’s niece, who came out as gay in the series at a time when there weren’t many lesbians in mainstream commercial fiction, is now so successful a character she seems to have left the plane we know as reality – she’s a cross between comedian Ellen DeGeneres and Mark Zuckerberg. And poor Scarpetta has got so much baggage, it takes whole chapters to explain exactly who tried to kill her previously, and when. Cornwell hasn’t quite painted herself into a corner, but it’s going that way. The research has got trickier, too, she says. “People are much more wary of me coming to see them. I did a tour of a nuclear power plant to discuss how terrorists might take it over for Cause of Death. Well, nobody is going to let me do that today. They were showing me the plans.” And while she’s made a point of always being up to date about the latest, most cutting-edge criminal threats – Depraved Heart features an NSA-inspired plot line about modern surveillance – she thinks people – us – should be much more scared than we actually are. “The technology out there is dangerous and it’s outpaced any sort of sensible regulation,” she says. Cornwell distrusts the internet and she distrusts the state with our data. “I’m sorry to say losing privacy is the same thing as losing freedom. I don’t care what they say about the limitations and boundaries they will install. They won’t. I’ve seen it with police and I hang out with cops all the time. If you make it possible for someone to look at something, they will.” It is perhaps not a coincidence that Cornwell’s fear of “data fiction”, as she calls it in Depraved Heart, followed her experiences in court where her private emails were read out by her accountants’ defence team. “It was a terrible violation because it’s a dirty pool. They subpoena every email you’ve ever sent and will put anything into the middle of the courtroom to embarrass you. It’s ugly. “Most people don’t see it [the threat of a loss of privacy] because they live in naive bliss,” Cornwell says. “They don’t realise how they are making themselves vulnerable and hopefully that never catches up with them.” What might seem like paranoia in someone else, is probably fairly sensible avoidance in her case. Even after she became successful and had put her past behind her, Cornwell seems to have been dogged by the kind of incidents that, if they turned up in a novel, would be frankly unbelievable. She had an affair with the wife of an FBI undercover agent who, when he found out, kidnapped his wife’s priest, strapped a fake bomb belt to him, and threatened to blow him up. He was found with a map of Cornwell’s house on him when he was arrested. More recently, after she launched the lawsuit against her accountants, she found herself targeted by the FBI for political campaign finance fraud. The charges were eventually dropped, but not until she’d been investigated for a year. “It was a harrowing experience. I lived an entire year pretty certain that I was going to go to prison because once the FBI sink their teeth into something, they don’t let go.” Her revenge in Depraved Heart is to never pass up an opportunity to say how useless the FBI are. “I saw such an ugly side of them. It didn’t matter that you hadn’t done anything, they just want to nail you for something.” Her action-woman persona is perhaps a statement of intent. It’s the opposite of victimhood. She says she took up diving because she’d made Scarpetta a diver and her insistence on researching every last detail demanded it. Her can-do, no-fears-will-hold-me-back attitude is probably not unrelated to the misery of her early childhood. Even without the paedophile and the abusive foster parent and the absent father and the mentally ill mother, it would have been difficult. “We moved from Miami and we didn’t talk like the other kids. My mom was divorced when nobody else was. And we lived in a very religious little town where girls weren’t supposed to do anything but get married and have children – and I was a tomboy.” It was Billy Graham’s wife, Ruth, who Cornwell credits with turning her life around. She took her under her wing when she was released from psychiatric hospital after being treated for anorexia, and encouraged her to try her hand at writing. “I don’t know that I would be alive today if it wasn’t for her.” Through the Grahams, Cornwell came to know George Bush Sr, but since Ruth’s death, she’s become estranged from the family and politically, she’s a supporter of Obama these days. But it was quite a journey, she says, coming from where she did, to coming to terms with her sexuality. “It was such a puritanical place and very ignorant. You never heard anything about women being gay. It didn’t exist. It was only men. And they were paedophiles, of course. That was the mindset.” But her strategy with this as with everything else has been to turn all setbacks to advantages. Though, she claims, this wasn’t so much a choice as just the way she’s made. “I am a survivor. I don’t know why. I was just lucky that I can take things that have been traumatic and use them as rocket fuel.” Her mother, in contrast, wasn’t able. “She had very traumatic experiences in her childhood and was never able to get over them.” While Cornwell has the confidence of someone with money and staff, there’s an unusual and winning degree of humility to her. “I really do try to give people the very best that I can,” she says. “I still do the same things I’ve always done, the research and all that – I put so much in. But I also know there are a lot of talented people out there who do amazing work and they don’t reach this level so it is a little bit like a lightning strike. I thought I was destined to be the biggest failure on the planet.” Not everything goes to plan in life. And Gawker may just have got it right. The world perhaps does need more lesbian true-crime authors who pilot helicopters, are obsessed with Jack the Ripper and maintained a warm friendship with Billy Graham’s wife for many years.

At her family's brewery in Lünne, Lower Saxony, about 800,000 litres of beer are produced a year: a light pilsner, a dark beer and a buckwheat brew. Borchert, 27, dreams of one day making her own India pale ale, though now fears she may have to put her aspirations on hold. In spring 2011, US energy group ExxonMobil made a horizontal test drill into shale rock under a field down the road, so far the only one of its kind in Germany. Many locals are now convinced that Lünne has been earmarked as the country's first site for fracking, the controversial method of extracting gas by injecting water, sand and chemicals into the rock at high pressure. Earlier this month, a leaked letter by the economy and energy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, hinted at permitting fracking from 2015, apparently confirming their suspicions. \"For brewers fracking could spell the end of our existence,\" says Borchert. Water used for brewing has to be \"even cleaner drinking water\". The fear alone that chemicals used during fracking might enter the local ground water could ruin the brewery's reputation. But then Germany is a beer nation, she says, and when brewers speak up politicians tend to listen. Only a big black valve in a metal cage tells of ExxonMobil's activities in Lünne. But the horizon illustrates the wider debate around Germany's energy future: there is a windfarm in the field next door, a coal power station in Ibbenbüren to the south and a nuclear power station in Lingen to the north. Allowing fracking, some argue, needs to be an acceptable compromise if Lünne wants to switch off the two power stations and boost the wind farms. If this proves as successful as it was in the US, it could help lower Germany's high energy prices and thus ease the Energiewende project to phase out nuclear by 2022. Germany consumes 90bn cubic metres of natural gas a year, making it the world's eighth biggest user. Only 12% of its consumption is home-produced – with 37% imported from Russia, a trade that has been increasingly perceived as a problem as the crisis in Ukraine has escalated. The EU energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, claimed in March that fracking could free Germany from its dependency on Russian imports \"for decades to come\". Many factors would make Lower Saxony the obvious place to start exploratory fracking. Most of Germany's shale reserves are located here, and 90% of the natural gas produced in the country is extracted by conventional means in the region. What's more, only a small percentage of the shale lies in areas that cannot be touched for fear of contaminating ground water. The Netherlands has already announced it will frack close to its border with Lower Saxony. If you can't escape the risks, some locals say, why not make some money? Unlike wind power, profits would not go to the farmers who own the land, but to the regional authorities. \"We are not against big energy per se, you can see that from all the power stations here. But there's a point where enough is enough,\" says Markus Rolink, who has been organising protests in Lünne since 2011. \"There has to be a perspective. With the windfarm there's the perspective that the nuclear power station will eventually get switched off. With shale gas I just see an investor at ExxonMobil pocketing the money and risking damage to our environment in the process.\" Protests in Lünne and around 30 other sites across Germany put companies like ExxonMobil off further exploratory drills two years ago. And in spite of industry lobbying and political tension in the Ukraine, it looks like Germany's beermakers and anti-fracking protesters may be able to claim victory in the long term too. Since last summer, its brewers association has been lobbying the environment minister, Barbara Hendricks, to update the water protection law to include even smaller brewers' wells and private mineral springs, further threatening the commercial viability of fracking in Germany. It appeared to work. A spokesman for the environment ministry said it intended to \"considerably tighten\" legislation around fracking. Any fracking-enabling legislation would have to be approved by the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament in which the ruling coalition parties do not hold a majority. The last government tried and failed to pass a similar \"fracking law\" last year. The draft bill for new legislation, originally scheduled before the summer recess, appears to have already been postponed to the autumn. Many of the key shale regions are represented by Green party environment ministers who want Germany to follow France's example and ban unconventional fracking across the country. \"We want Germany to have the world's strictest fracking safeguards,\" Lower Saxony's environment minister Stefan Wenzel says. \"If ExxonMobil wants to have a future in Germany, they should invest in renewable energies.\" Were the government to pass legislation that enabled fracking, the relevant region could block planned drills by using local laws, as Wenzel's counterpart in Schleswig-Holstein, Robert Habeck, told the Guardian he would. On 11 July, he is submitting his own proposal for a nationwide ban to the Bundesrat. Varying estimates of Germany's shale resources and concerns about the commercial viability of fracking could play into their hands. ExxonMobil says fracking could allow the country to cover its gas needs for the next 20 to 25 years. The president of the German Agency for Geoscience and Raw Materials, Hans-Joachim Kümpel, says that while there is enough shale to cover a third of Germany's gas needs for 40 years, it was \"unrealistic\" to expect that Germany can achieve complete gas independent . Other experts suggest that only a billion cubic metres would realistically be frackable every year, covering no more than 1% of the country's annual use. The costs for industry remain considerable: even the test drill in Lünne cost ExxonMobil €2.5m (£2m). Stefan Lechtenböhmer of the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy says he believes fracking will cover Germany's gas consumption for nine years at best, and lower gas prices by no more than 1% or 2%. \"Fracking won't solve Germany's energy dilemmas. It's a homeopathic measure.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jun/14/japanese-mayor-restart-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-14T07:28:02Z","webTitle":"Japanese mayor approves plan to restart nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/14/japanese-mayor-restart-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/14/japanese-mayor-restart-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Japanese mayor approves plan to restart nuclear power plant","bodyText":"Japan has taken a potentially decisive step towards restarting two of its idled nuclear reactors after the mayor of a town located near a power plant approved plans to bring it back into operation. The country has been without nuclear power since 5 May, when a reactor in the northern island of Hokkaido became the last of 50 working reactors to be shut down in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Four other reactors at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were badly damaged when the plant was hit by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and 14-metre tsunami on 11 March 2011. Dozens of others have been closed for regular maintenance, and cannot be restarted until they pass stress tests introduced by the government last year to address public concerns over safety. Shinobu Tokioka, the mayor of Oi, a town in Fukui prefecture, said he had been persuaded to support the restart after the prefecture's nuclear safety commission said earlier this week that necessary safety measures had been put in place. Tokioka, who founded a company that supplies pipes and other materials to the plant, added he was concerned about possible power shortages and the impact on the local economy if the plant remained closed. Issei Nishikawa, the governor of Fukui prefecture – Japan's \"nuclear alley\" with 13 reactors – is also expected to approve the measure. The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, is expected to make the decision official on Saturday. The reactors would be switched back on immediately, although they would not reach full output until the end of July. Pressure has been mounting for the restart amid warnings that the Kansai region of western Japan, which includes the industrial city of Osaka, could suffer power shortages during peak demand this summer. The plant's operator, Kansai Electric Power, forecast that without the Oi reactors, the region would suffer power shortages of around 15% in July and August, and has asked customers to cut usage by at least 15% on weekdays for three months from July. The utility's projections show that Kansai, a region of 24 million people with an economy the size of Australia's, would still suffer shortages even if the reactors were switched back on. Noda does not require local approval for the restart, but has been attempting to build support in areas near the plant due to widespread opposition to nuclear power post-Fukushima. Only two of 11 municipal governments within a 18 mile (30km) radius of the Oi plant support the restart, according to a recent survey by Kyodo. Last week, Noda said a prolonged nuclear shutdown could put Japan's national survival at risk. \"Cheap and stable electricity is vital,\" he said in a televised speech. \"If all the reactors that previously provided 30% of Japan's electricity supply are halted, or kept idle, Japanese society cannot survive.\" Supporters of the restart have warned that, without nuclear power, utilities would be more dependent on fossil fuels, driving up electricity bills and putting Japan's climate change obligations at risk. Noda said the government had done enough to ensure the No 3 and No 4 reactors at Oi would not leak radiation if they were struck by an earthquake and tsunami as powerful as those that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi. He received a boost late last month when Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, ditched his opposition to the restart, although Noda still faces opposition from MPs inside his own party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2014/apr/24/corporate-security-failures-mistakes-data","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-24T13:31:59Z","webTitle":"Carry on leaking: when corporate security goes really, really wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/24/corporate-security-failures-mistakes-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/apr/24/corporate-security-failures-mistakes-data","fields":{"headline":"Carry on leaking: when corporate security goes really, really wrong","bodyText":"Getting security right is hard, especially for businesses. Outside of fending off scores of attacks on a daily basis, they have to deal with their own employees opening up risk by making stupid mistakes. On top of that, security chiefs have to worry about the tech protecting the company’s data actually working. So things often go wrong, either in hopelessly inevitable or horribly surprising ways. With that in mind, the Guardian has uncovered some of the more embarrassing failings that have somehow managed to avoid public attention. Until now, of course… Happens to the best of them  The worst security snafus are often born out of technology failures. Mistakes at anti-virus (AV) vendors have caused plenty of pain over the years. The Guardian was told by one source about one security firm that accidentally sent a malicious file to its entire UK security base back in 2004. If opened, it risked getting malware on employees’ machines. Remember, this is a company that is supposed to stop the propagation of such nastiness. “They recognised the error straight away and notified all the UK users the infected file had been sent to, asking them not to open it, and setting out what to do if the document had been opened,” says our source, who was involved in the clean-up operation. “It wasn’t a nasty worm, and there were very few reported infections, but it was obviously not ideal for an AV company.” Certainly the funniest AV company cock up came in 2012 when Sophos infamously identified its own security software as a computer virus and then deleted some of its critical files from those systems it was installed on back in 2006, McAfee identified Microsoft Excel as a virus and promptly removed it from affected computers. A nuclear password leak?! Passwords often provide the keys to the kingdom. Occasionally, they leak on the public internet. To find these, attackers do Google searches related to their target to see if the search giant has indexed any useful login details. This is known as a “Google dork attack”.   One might expect a small to medium-sized business to leak some secrets online, but what about the US government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission? A post on a public forum this March noted the organisation, which governs the safety of nuclear power production and other civilian uses of nuclear materials, had leaked a username and password in an Excel file that could be accessed via Google.   It does not appear the documents that are accessible using the logins are particularly interesting. But it’s clear the files were valuable enough to have some kind of protection wrapped around them.   The NRC says the documents protected by the password were publicly available anyway, but the researcher who uncovered the credentials, who went by the name Hon1nbo, tells the Guardian “this is still a bypass of their business logic in that a user doesn't have to make a formal request, and that they don't know who is accessing data under these credentials,” Hon1nbo says. Given passwords are often re-used, any kind of leak is worrying.   This is a lesson for everyone: make sure you aren’t openly sharing passwords, no matter what they’re for. And for anyone involved in nuclear power: don’t leak anything, ever. When the good guys do worse than the bad Sometimes facepalms don’t do the errors they deplore justice. Security consultant Brian Honan was working with a customer on dealing with an attack, where they believed they had located its source. They subsequently contacted the security service provider the client used, asking it to block connections coming in from the attacker. But rather than just cut off one source from the outside, they shut off all connections into the company. “The service provider had not only blocked that IP address but all external IP addresses resulting in remote workers and offices not being able to connect. So instead of mitigating the impact of the attack the provider mistakenly caused more damage than the attacker,” Honan says. “Lesson learnt, always be very clear in requests to third parties, especially when under pressure, and never assume the person has the same level of understanding of the situation as you do.” Copying idiocy Honan has another rather splendid tale from the days when technology was poorly understood. At least by one poor fellow. Honan explains: “Many years ago a client rang to say they had computer virus on a CD they had received. I asked them to send me a copy of the CD so we could analyse what was on it.   “To my surprise a few minutes later our fax machine chirped and gurgled as it received a photocopy of the said CD. Lesson learnt, always be explicit in your instructions and don’t assume people interpret technical terms the same way you do.”   Oh… You’re only supposed to blow the doors off Businesses often do physical security badly, even though the same basic principles apply to their PC protection. Take passwords. We all know not to have them printed in an easily perceptible physical format, right? So the same would go for passcodes to access buildings, right? Wrong.   “I was doing an audit of a secure facility inside an office block that used two-factor authentication for entry into the secure area, comprising of an access card and a four digit pin. All looked good and met the criteria that needed to be met. However, knowing this environment and the people concerned fairly well, and with a fair amount of hubris, I concluded all wasn't right. The project managers were openly adamant everything was fine,” says Thom Langford, a security consultant.   “It turns out that the four digit pin that had been supplied to the individuals used the last four digits of the badge, printed on the back of their badge. To make my point I then proceeded to let the next 10 or so people into the secure area by taking their card and using the last four digits of the card.” Not the banks! The UK’s banks are often the vanguards of the security world, showing us all how it should be done. But, as we all know, the banking industry isn’t always responsible. For instance, former convicted hacker turned legit, Cal Leeming, says that when he was brought on board at one major bank after his imprisonment to highlight ways people can subvert their systems, he disclosed a flaw he liked to exploit in his darker days. That was back in 2006. Leeming says the bank still hasn’t fixed the issue.   Javvad Malik, from analyst firm 451 Research, remembers one case where following an incident at a major financial institution, a security provider was brought in to investigate. They discovered that an entire portion of the organisation’s network, known as a or Demilitarised Zone, was not being monitored. That zone is essentially a subnetwork used by companies to check for requests coming from the public internet. It’s where companies detect malicious activity, so if you aren’t monitoring it, something has gone very, very wrong. It’s clear even those who are supposed to have the highest levels of data protection, whether they’re financial institutions, nuclear power regulators or security companies, are prone to error. Which at least should make you feel a little better if your Facebook account gets hacked..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2014/sep/21/private-island-britain-belongs-someone-else-review-compelling-study-industries-foreign-hands","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-21T08:00:09Z","webTitle":"Private Island: Why Britain Now Belongs to Someone Else review – a forensic critique of privatisation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/21/private-island-britain-belongs-someone-else-review-compelling-study-industries-foreign-hands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/sep/21/private-island-britain-belongs-someone-else-review-compelling-study-industries-foreign-hands","fields":{"headline":"Private Island: Why Britain Now Belongs to Someone Else review – a forensic critique of privatisation","bodyText":"Ah, the end of history. Remember that? Give the pesky locals political freedom and 1,000 years of joyful free markets would beckon. Democracy and capitalism would walk hand in hand down the aisle, consummating the triumph of one system. This was the early 90s and, like James Meek, I had the privilege of reporting on the collapse of the Soviet Union and the communist system. We also had the misfortune of watching hubristic western advisers lecturing to the Russians and eastern Europeans about the way ahead. Embrace privatisation and all would be well. Flog off all the assets, as quickly as possible, to the highest bidder. I recall how these famous economists – many of whom would now be too embarrassed to admit their role – acted as puppet masters in the finance ministry in Moscow. One of the results was the carve-up of Russia’s natural resources between a small group of unsavoury characters who knew whom to pay off and whom to frighten off. This great act of economic theft and ideological folly gave rise to the phenomenon of the oligarchs, the most conspicuous members of the global super-rich. In his devastating account of the privatisation dogma of the past 25 years, Meek makes clear that these policies formed part of a bigger picture. He charts the link between the policies pursued abroad and at home, policies that in the UK have now turned full circle. Whole swathes of industry, particularly the public utilities, are in the hands of foreign state companies whose very existence would not be tolerated here at home. Meek bombards the reader with compelling facts, but he does so with panache. After all, how many authors could turn a passage about ownership of the water industry into a page-turner? “It is the hypocrisy, in particular, of a party that claims to loathe nothing more than communism and totalitarianism obliging Londoners to pay a tithe to the Chinese government just for turning on the tap,” he notes. Or this, in regard to the British electricity industry and its domination by the French state monolith EDF: “In Thatcherite terms EDF was a public-sector mammoth that would inevitably be hunted to extinction by the hungry and agile competitors of post-privatisation countries like Britain.” He focuses his forensic glare from the railways to nuclear power, via the NHS, to housing and the postal service. He becomes an expert on everything from postal shift patterns to the intricacies of the French health service. Privatisation, rather than ushering in an era of consumer power and open competition, has led to monopolistic stitch-ups against consumers and allowed fat cats to pay themselves silly money on the basis of “performance indicators” produced for their benefit. “The reality is that the faceless state bureaucrats of the old electricity boards have been replaced by the faceless (and better paid) private bureaucrats of the electricity companies.” The dream of free marketeers was to turn Britain into a nation of small shareholders. Before Mrs Thatcher came to power in 1979, individuals held almost 40% of shares in UK companies. By 1981, it was less than 30% and by the time she died in 2013, it had slumped to under 12%. As demolition jobs go, this can hardly be bettered. The absence of polemic makes the quietly withering prose all the more powerful. And yet in his understandable desire to provide a single narrative, Meek does not mention those industries whose privatisation could be deemed a success. Do we hark back with pride to the era of nationalised airlines? And what about our phones? There’s surely no nostalgia to be found in the old rickety GPO. Most people, I would suggest, are agnostic about the means of ownership. What matters is what works. And as the author demonstrates beyond peradventure, many of the privatisations have failed in their core goals of delivering better services. To say so is not ideological; to deny the overwhelming evidence is.

The attempt to codify how international law applies to online attacks includes a provision for states to respond with conventional force if aggression through hacking into computer networks by another state results in death or significant damage to property. The handbook, written by 20 legal experts working in conjunction with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the US Cyber Command, says full-scale wars could be triggered by online attacks on computer systems. It also states that so-called \"hacktivists\" who participate in online attacks during a war can be legitimate targets even though they are civilians. The group of experts was invited to draw up the handbook by Nato's Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. The project took three years. The centre was established in 2008 following a wave of cyber-attacks on the Baltic state from inside Russia. The denial-of-service attacks crashed websites and damaged Estonia's infrastructure, raising awareness about the damage that online operations can inflict in an increasingly computer-dependent era. In January David Cameron announced that the UK would be joining the CCDCOE this year. The UK ambassador to Tallinn, Chris Holtby, said then: \"The UK will send an expert as well as continue the wider co-operation between the UK and the centre which already exists. The UK values strongly the work of the centre and looks forward to increasing our contribution.\" The Tallinn manual, which contains 95 \"black letter rules\", was formally launched at the London thinktank Chatham House last Friday. Colonel Kirby Abbott, an assistant legal adviser at Nato, said at the launch that the manual was now \"the most important document in the law of cyber-warfare. It will be highly useful.\" Professor Michael Schmitt, director of the project, who works at the US Naval War College, said there was relatively little consensus about how existing legal regimes governed online activities. The Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear programme, which physically damaged sensitive centrifuges, divided opinion among experts in the Tallinn group as to whether it constituted an armed conflict. The computer worm is widely believed to have been created by the US and/or Israel. Rule 22 of the handbook states: \"An international armed conflict exists whenever there are hostilities, which may include or be limited to cyber operations occurring between two states or more.\" An attached commentary adds: \"To date, no international armed conflict has been publicly characterised as having been solely precipitated in cyberspace. Nevertheless, the international group of experts unanimously concluded that cyber operations alone might have the potential to cross the threshold of international armed conflict.\" The manual suggests \"proportionate counter-measures\" against online attacks carried out by a state are permitted. Such measures cannot involve the use of force, however, unless the original cyber-attack resulted in death or significant damage to property. Formulating a framework for permitted counter-measures should not lower the threshold for future conflicts, Schmitt told the Guardian. \"You can only use force when you reach the level of armed conflict. Everyone talks about cyberspace as though it's the wild west. We discovered that there's plenty of law that applies to cyberspace.\" It is often difficult to locate the source of an online attack. Publicity last month about a tower block in Shanghai said to contain a Chinese army unit and to be the source of numerous global cyber-attacks highlighted the difficulty of proving who is responsible for causing damage to computer systems. Rule seven of the manual declares that if a cyber operation originates from a government network, \"it is not sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to that state but is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation\". The handbook says that, in accordance with Geneva conventions, attacks on certain key civilian sites are outlawed. Rule 80 of the handbook states: \"In order to avoid the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population, particular care must be taken during cyber-attacks against works an installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, as well as installations located in their vicinity.\" Hospitals and medical units are also protected as they would be under rules governing traditional warfare. The handbook is not official Nato document or policy but an advisory manual. It is published by Cambridge University Press. A retired UK air commodore and several British lawyers were among those who worked on the project. In 2010 the UK's national security strategy characterised cyber-attacks, including those by other states, as one of four \"tier one\" threats alongside terrorism, military crises between states and major accidents. • This article was amended on 26 March 2013. The original article, and subheading, said the report was the first attempt to codify how international law applies to online attacks.

Its plans to create a single market incorporating Europe and the United States, progressing so nicely when hardly anyone knew, have been blown wide open. All over Europe people are asking why this is happening; why we were not consulted; for whom it is being done. They have good reason to ask. The commission insists that its Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership should include a toxic mechanism called investor-state dispute settlement. Where this has been forced into other trade agreements, it has allowed big corporations to sue governments before secretive arbitration panels composed of corporate lawyers, which bypass domestic courts and override the will of parliaments. This mechanism could threaten almost any means by which governments might seek to defend their citizens or protect the natural world. Already it is being used by mining companies to sue governments trying to keep them out of protected areas; by banks fighting financial regulation; by a nuclear company contesting Germany's decision to switch off atomic power. After a big political fight we've now been promised plain packaging for cigarettes. But it could be nixed by an offshore arbitration panel. The tobacco company Philip Morris is currently suing Australia through the same mechanism in another treaty. No longer able to keep this process quiet, the European commission has instead devised a strategy for lying to us. A few days ago an internal document was leaked. This reveals that a \"dedicated communications operation\" is being \"co-ordinated across the commission\". It involves, to use the commission's chilling phrase, the \"management of stakeholders, social media and transparency\". Managing transparency should be adopted as its motto. The message is that the trade deal is about \"delivering growth and jobs\" and will not \"undermine regulation and existing levels of protection in areas like health, safety and the environment\". Just one problem: it's not true. From the outset, the transatlantic partnership has been driven by corporations and their lobby groups, who boast of being able to \"co-write\" it. Persistent digging by the Corporate Europe Observatory reveals that the commission has held eight meetings on the issue with civil society groups, and 119 with corporations and their lobbyists. Unlike the civil society meetings, these have taken place behind closed doors and have not been disclosed online. Though the commission now tells the public that it will protect \"the state's right to regulate\", this isn't the message the corporations have been hearing. In an interview last week, Stuart Eizenstat, co-chair of the Transatlantic Business Council – instrumental in driving the process – was asked if companies whose products had been banned by regulators would be able to sue [see footnote]. Yes. \"If a suit like that was brought and was successful, it would mean that the country banning the product would have to pay compensation to the industry involved or let the product in.\" Would that apply to the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine, a controversial practice permitted in the US? \"That's one example where it might.\" What the commission and its member governments fail to explain is why we need offshore arbitration at all. It insists that domestic courts \"might be biased or lack independence\", but which courts is it talking about? It won't say. Last month, while trying to defend the treaty, the British minister Kenneth Clarke said something revealing: \"Investor protection is a standard part of free-trade agreements – it was designed to support businesses investing in countries where the rule of law is unpredictable, to say the least.\" So what is it doing in an EU-US deal? Why are we using measures designed to protect corporate interests in failed states in countries with a functioning judicial system? Perhaps it's because functioning courts are less useful to corporations than opaque and unjust arbitration by corporate lawyers. As for the commission's claim that the trade deal will produce growth and jobs, this is also likely to be false. Barack Obama promised that the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement would increase US exports by $10bn. They immediately fell by $3.5bn. The 70,000 jobs it would deliver? Er, 40,000 were lost. Bill Clinton promised that the North American Free Trade Agreement would create 200,000 new jobs for the US; 680,000 went down the pan. As the commentator Glyn Moody says: \"The benefits are slight and illusory, while the risks are very real.\" So where are our elected representatives? Fast asleep. Labour MEPs, now frantically trying to keep investor-state dispute mechanisms out of the agreement, are the exception; the rest are in Neverland. The Lib Dem MEP Graham Watson wrote in his newsletter, before dismissing the idea: \"I am told that columnists on the Guardian and the Independent claim it will hugely advantage US multinational companies to the detriment of Europe.\" We said no such thing, as he would know had he read the articles, rather than idiotically relying on hearsay. The treaty is likely to advantage the corporations of both the US and the EU, while disadvantaging their people. It presents a danger to democracy and public protection throughout the trading area. Caroline Lucas, one of the few MPs interested in the sovereignty of parliament, has published an early-day motion on the issue. It has so far been signed by seven MPs. For the government, Clarke argues that to ignore the potential economic gains \"in favour of blowing up a controversy around one small part of the negotiations, known as investor protection, seems to me positively Scrooge-like\". Quite right too. Overriding our laws, stripping away our rights, making parliament redundant: these are trivial and irrelevant beside the issue of how much money could be made. Don't worry your little heads about it. • This footnote was appended on 16 December. Mr Eizenstat has asked us to make clear that he was not talking about investor-state agreements in the interview and was only referring to the EU obligations if a successful suit was brought under WTO regulations. • Twitter: @georgemonbiot.

As I wrote in Foreign Affairs (Monitoring Moscow's Victory, 24 March), this mission may inadvertently help Moscow consolidate its influence and further weaken Kiev's tenuous hold on eastern Ukraine. According to Borger, a senior OSCE official is pleading for \"Russian help in getting through roadblocks\" is effectively ceding control of eastern Ukraine to Moscow. The OSCE will likely be drawn into murky discussions about responsibility for incidents while struggling with security threats and layers of disinformation from all sides. Monitors will be consumed by daily mini-crises as the region slips further from Kiev's control. Quickly assembling a staff means relying on secondments from OSCE states. Westerners will participate but so will Russians appointed by their government and likely reporting to it. Ukraine, as the country being monitored, will not have its nationals represented in the mission or shaping its reports. Although international officials will keep affirming Ukraine's \"territorial integrity\", monitors will in effect serve as tripwires restraining Ukrainian authorities from using force to regain sovereignty. OSCE's well-focused election observation missions have gained wide and deserved respect, but its ability to resolve separatist conflicts is limited. Unarmed monitors can defuse small issues and promote calm. But locals know that the guys with guns are the real powers and an OSCE mission will not stop eastern Ukraine from becoming another unresolved separatist conflict in Europe – or, perhaps, Russia's newest province. Elisabeth Brocking Alexandria, Virginia, USA • As John Pilger rightly states, Nato has surrounded Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union (Nato's action plan is right out of Dr Strangelove, 18 April) and is stoking up confrontation between Japan and China. This places us on a collision course not only with China and Russia but also with Iran and those areas in the Middle East with which Iran has an alliance. Meanwhile, the British government has been inviting both Russia and China to take controlling stakes in new nuclear power stations. Well, perhaps it will think again about Russia. When will it realise that, due to its own actions with Nato, China is an equally inappropriate partner when it comes to nuclear power? All we need is the nuclear factor included in Nato's plans and the nightmare of Dr Strangelove is complete. Linda Rogers Beaumaris, Ynys Mon • To suggest that the ordinary Ukrainians who demonstrated against the corruption and creeping authoritarianism of Victor Yanukovych's government were simply dupes of the US is insulting in the extreme. Far from being the gang of rampaging fascists portrayed by John Pilger, the interim government has behaved with remarkable restraint under intense provocation. As for the charge of antisemitism, last month 21 Ukrainian Jewish leaders refuted claims that the new government was antisemitic and expressed support for Ukraine's national sovereignty. Finally, Nato has not \"taken over\" any country or region. Several independent countries in eastern Europe have freely chosen to join Nato to ensure their mutual security. J Bourn Gateshead • Your editorial (19 April) seemed to imply that the Russian president is the cause of all the unrest, ignoring the fact that the majority of the population in many of the towns in eastern Ukraine do not want to be governed by Kiev and are rather scared of the anti-Russian message of this new (and unelected) government. Andrew Lee-Hart Wallasey, Cheshire • Any effort to subdue the largely Russian-speaking population in eastern Ukraine by force is doomed to fail (Report, 17 April). Ukrainians from east and west are all ethnically related and largely share the same Orthodox Christian religion. The current government was created via a western-backed putsch that unseated the elected government there and is therefore not considered legitimate by millions of Ukrainians. No amount of tanks, warplanes, propaganda and soldiers will convince them otherwise. Now is the time to foster talks with Russia, Ukraine, western Europe and the US to work out a solution that is agreed upon by all parties. We might also want to consider cantonising Ukraine as was done in Bosnia. The only other alternative will be civil war.

The gross disparity between western e-waste (25kg per capita annually) and African (1.7kg) is just one of the many heads of the Hydra driving the vast and tragic displacement of human beings. Our profligacy not only pillages, with concomitant pollution, the resources of less privileged countries, but outsources manufacture to places where substandard if not slave wages are paid to non-unionised labour. How much of last year’s 41.8m tonnes of e-waste is being lucratively traded by criminal gangs and dumped back on the doorsteps of the poor? While westerners install private pools and multiple en suite toilets, the World Health Organisation estimates that 1 billion people don’t have access to clean drinking water, and a third of humankind lacks basic sanitation, causing 3.5 million deaths annually. The average Bangladeshi has an ecological footprint of 0.5 hectares; the average Australian requires nine hectares. This isn’t simply unjust, it’s both obscene and ecocidal. There are no piecemeal answers. The only solution I can see is a radical overhaul of an economic system accountable to neither morality nor social and ecological justice, and whose highest earners truck in weapons, illegal drugs, pornography and people trafficking. Can anything change until we begin to accept our complicity in the desperation at our gates? Annie March West Hobart, Tasmania, Australia It may already be too late Larry Elliott’s sobering review (24 April) outlines what needs to be done to keep global CO2 emissions below the feared scenario: runaway climate change and civilisation-destroying levels. By 2035, near doubling natural gas’s share in power generation, carbon capture on existing coal plants, expanding renewables fourfold, doubling nuclear power etc – in short, everything conceivable. He details a number of other essential measures: eliminating subsidies to the oil industry, placing a price on carbon, subsiding the developing world’s transition to a carbon-free economy. Time is short. With the accelerating release of methane from melting Arctic permafrost and ocean sediments, it may already be too late. What then is preventing humanity from embarking on the required transformations, which would generate a massive stimulus in the global economy? While rejecting capitalism, Naomi Klein’s villain, Elliott fails to provide an adequate explanation. That we all consume hydrocarbon fuels poses the question of who stands to lose by its elimination. Only the fossil-fuel industry suffers in the move to alternate energy sources. We will only Keep It In The Ground if we break the domination this industry exerts over our governments. Brian Ostrow Guelph, Ontario, Canada • Congratulations on publishing the splendid article by Larry Elliott on the global economy and fossil fuels. The argument he makes about energy prospects in the “developing world” and the need for “the rest of the world” to help them in developing renewable energy is important. Perhaps a solution will also emerge when the distinction between profit and growth is clarified. Much of the waste of both energy and materials in rich countries results from the unceasing drive to produce and sell varieties of the same goods that differ from one another only in superficial ways. Durability conflicts with sales, and patent laws protect profit at the cost of developments that could be of real benefit to the consumer. On top of it all is the huge advertising effort, which consumes energy and materials without really helping people to make informed choices. Here again Elliott opens the way to further discussion when he writes: “It is extremely simplistic to be pro-growth or anti-growth. What matters is what sort of growth.” RF Price Eaglemont, Victoria, Australia • It’s a shame that in quoting Professor Dieter Helm in his article on surviving without fossil fuels that Larry Elliott didn’t find a more sensible statement from a man who must know better. To suggest that those questioning growth want to abandon technology, as Helm says, is untrue and unhelpful. It confuses growth with progress. No country can sustain a culture of endless growth in the throughput of materials, the associated waste stream, and the consumption of energy to drive the whole process. That is the type of mindless growth we should question. By all means let’s continue to improve technology, educate more people better, and increase the value of the goods and services we produce – and count that as growth. Well done GW for finally tackling the issue of fossil fuel and growth. There is an extensive literature out there on this, so hopefully there’ll be more GW articles. Here in Australia there is no recognition on the part of the Murdoch press, the Liberal government or the Labour opposition that the goal of endless growth is even an issue, let alone a selfish and dangerous folly. Peter Martin Port Willunga, South Australia • I am a fan of Larry Elliott on economics, but less so when he moves into social sciences. Regarding Cuba, he asserts that every possible scrap of land is exploited for food production. This may be so within the town environments, though likely for ideological reasons, but I would say that fully 50% of the agricultural land is not used in the countryside. I have always wondered if that was because of poor soil quality or inefficiency. It is perhaps the one area where opening up to trade with the US would help. Stephen Banks Birmingham, UK Beware of techno-fixes I read your article about carbon capture and storage (17 April) and one thing mentioned by Naomi Klein in her book This Changes Everything came to mind: Wolf talks about the fact that CO2 is a desired “propellant” that can be pumped into old oil wells in order to extract even more oil. Indeed, there could be a ready market for that captured carbon. And it would also be interesting to know the true “energy costs” of CCS? Could it not be the case that, by the time you have captured, transported and stored that carbon, the net energy gain from the power produced is either dramatically reduced or even negative? I am highly sceptical about techno-fixes such as CCS and feel that, if we are not careful, we could end up with a situation where CCS does more harm than good by sapping power from energy production. The carbon extracted might even be used to turn old oilfields into bubbling fountains of black gold, the burning of which releases even more carbon into the atmosphere. My solution? We should all use dramatically less electricity. Or are our gadgets, our gizmos and our air-conditioned comfort more important than the planet? Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany It is wrong to snub Putin I admit I am a Putinversteher (Putin understander, as Timothy Garton Ash says), born and partially raised in the former GDR by parents also born and raised in that state with grandparents who were displaced by the second world war. For me it is a shame that the western leaders are not represented in Moscow at the celebration for the Soviet victory, 9 May (West snubs Russia’s victory rally, 24 April). Or at least, like Angela Merkel, make a compromise and somehow appreciate the Russian/Soviet contribution at that big tragedy unfolding 70 years ago. Not the dubbed D-Day was the turning point of the war; the breakthrough of the red army at Heeresgruppe Mitte was. Since 20 to 25 million Soviet citizens died during the four years of war, it is a disgrace to all of them not to attend any commemoration whatsoever. Steffen Müller Schönberg, Germany True democracy is very rare I sometimes become a little exasperated by some of the west’s views on democracy, like those of Simon Tisdall in his article West must pressure Thailand (10 April). There is more to democracy than elections, and the present Thai government has done more and brought more peace to Thailand than either of the previous two governments. There will be elections eventually but not before the two opposing sides can accept the result and not riot against the winning side, causing more disruption and unhappiness. It should be said that in regard to the current election in the UK, so few people actually vote that whoever the winner is can hardly be said to represent the majority of the population. In the US, Congress does not represent the people, but represents interests. Business and other lobby groups who have provided the cash for the candidates to fight their obscenely expensive elections want something in return. So neither meets the description of a true democracy. It should be remembered that the most successful country in Asia – Singapore – can hardly said to be truly democratic, and yet is much favoured by the west.

Speaking at his Tokyo corporate headquarters , Naomi Hirose, president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which runs the stricken Fukushima plant, said Britain's nuclear managers \"should be prepared for the worst\" in order to avoid repeating Japan's traumatic experience. \"We tried to persuade people that nuclear power is 100% safe. That was easy for both sides. Our side explains how safe nuclear power is. The other side is the people who listen and for them it is easy to hear OK, it's safe, sure, why not? \"But we have to explain, no matter how small a possibility, what if this [safety] barrier is broken? We have to prepare a plan if something happens … It is easy to say this is almost perfect so we don't have to worry about it. But we have to keep thinking: what if …\" British ministers recently agreed a commercial deal with the French state-owned energy company EDF Energy to build the UK's first new nuclear reactor in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The agreement included the UK government providing accident insurance. Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi facility on the coast about 124 miles (200km) north-east of Tokyo, comprising six nuclear reactors, was hit by a giant tsunami with waves peaking at 17 metres high caused by the Great East Japan earthquake on 11 March 2011. In what quickly became one of the world's worst nuclear disasters, operators lost control of the plant when the power supply, including emergency back-up, failed amid massive flooding. As cooling systems malfunctioned, reactors 1, 2 and 3 suffered meltdowns. Reactor 4 was closed for routine maintenance at the time. But one of several hydrogen explosions blew the walls and roof off the reactor building. This week a delicate and lengthy operation to remove fuel rods from that reactor began. Radiation leakage following the explosions forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding area. An exclusion zone roughly 11 miles by 19 miles remains in force around the plant two and half years later. The entire facility is now being decommissioned, but Tepco's clean-up, which has been strongly criticised by environmentalists, is expected to take up to 40 years. Hirose said that although the situation facing Fukushima Daiichi on 11 March was exceptional, measures could have been adopted in advance that might have mitigated the impact of the disaster. Tepco was at fault for failing to take these steps, he said. \"After I became president [in 2012], we formed a nuclear safety review committee. We focused mainly on what we could do, what we could learn. We had a lot of data by then. Three other reports, one from the Diet [Japan's parliament], one from government. We had a lot of information. Tepco's own report, too. We concluded that we should have avoided that catastrophic accident, and we could have. We could see what we should have done.\" Preventative measures included fitting waterproof seals on all the doors in the reactor building, or placing an electricity-generating turbine on the facility's roof, where the water might not have reached it. In addition, wrong assumptions were made, he said. \"I don't know if I could have seen or thought this before the accident … Probably I assumed that people had discussed counter-measures to avoid a huge tsunami by something very special like a complete shutdown.\" It transpired that the huge cost and technical complexity of a multiple shutdown, in what was considered the unlikely event of an abnormally large tsunami, had led managers to discount such a scenario as implausible and inefficient, he said. \"What happened at Fukushima was, yes, a warning to the world,\" he said. The resulting lesson was clear: \"Try to examine all the possibilities, no matter how small they are, and don't think any single counter-measure is foolproof. Think about all different kinds of small counter-measures, not just one big solution. There's not one single answer. \"We made a lot of excuses to ourselves … Looking back, seals on the doors, one little thing, could have saved everything.\" Tepco was willing to share its experience with British and other nuclear plant operators if they wished, Hirose said. \"We can share all the information, all the data we obtained, that we learned from this accident, and then hope that people will use the data and information to prevent the same thing happening.\" Hirose confirmed that his company has paid a large price for the disaster. It planned to \"streamline\" the business and shed hundreds of jobs through voluntary retirement to keep itself in business. \"We have a huge debt for the compensation for damages and losses and for decommissioning … We have to be sustainable as a going concern.\" Concerned that Tepco may be unable to cope and responding to criticism that the company has bungled parts of the clean-up operation, Japan's government has agreed to spend 47bn yen (£292m) on dealing with hundreds of static tanks to store radiated water at the plant. It is also considering paying part of the cost to decommission Fukushima's damaged nuclear reactors. Tepco will reportedly seek 500bn yen (£3.1bn) in bank loans by the end of the year to help keep itself afloat. Asked about the severe domestic and international criticism that followed the discovery in July of leaks from some of the tanks storing contaminated water, Hirose said the problem stemmed from a \"simple mistake\" in managing the tanks. Since the discovery, the monitoring system had been changed and new welded tanks installed, instead of the old bolted together versions. Hirose said he could not state categorically that all leakage of contaminated groundwater into the sea had ceased, but the outflow was much reduced. \"Probably there is some leakage. It is very difficult to say where it comes from and how much it is, but the harbour [radioactivity] level does not go down, so that means there is some leakage … We are trying to stop it.\" Hirose said he felt deeply sorry for the estimated 150,000 local residents who have been forced to leave their homes due to potentially harmful radiation levels, and may in some cases never be able to return. \"I have visited Fukushima many times, met the evacuees, the fishing union, the farmers, many people whose businesses have been damaged very much. I feel very sorry for them. We have to compensate them fully for the damage we caused by our accident.\" Tepco was investing in the area and creating jobs by building a new thermal power plant. But he acknowledged reconstruction and rebuilding would take many years. After the Fukushima catastrophe, the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation conducted a safety review and its chief inspector, Mike Weightman, concluded there were \"no fundamental safety weaknesses\" in UK nuclear plants. He said: \"We already require protection of nuclear sites against the worst-case scenarios that are predictable for the UK.\" But his report found 38 areas for improvement including risks associated with flooding and the state of preparedness for emergencies. In 2012, documents released under freedom of information rules showed that all eight coastal nuclear locations in the UK, including Hinkley Point, were at risk of flooding and coastal erosion, which would worsen with climate change. EDF Energy said it was confident its UK sites were adequately protected against storms and floods. \"Without these arrangements in place the regulator would have the authority to close us down,\" said an EDF spokeswoman. Hirose said that although there are currently no nuclear powerplants operating in Japan, nuclear power had a future in the country. Popular former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi called last week for Japan to abandon nuclear power altogether, saying it was demonstrably dangerous. The best course for Japan and other developed countries was energy diversification, Hirose said, combining nuclear power with other forms of generation, including oil, gas and renewables.

Tuesday’s low of $75.84 per barrel was more than 25% below the prices of just this past summer. Oil’s slippery price slope could get even slipperier as winter approaches. It’s simple supply-and-demand economics: a worldwide slowdown in demand for oil, combined with the ongoing expansion of global production, thanks largely to aggressive extraction from US shale-rock formations, has sent the price of crude oil tumbling like a stone. Where the bottom is and when it will be reached, nobody really knows. Goldman Sachs, which last week raised the specter of oil market oversupply in a report, slashed its price forecast for next year to $70 per barrel. Research analysts at the investment bank said they expect prices to recover to $80 per barrel in 2016 and beyond – which would remain well below west Texas prices over the last five years. Consumers can rejoice over this reprieve at the pump – even environmentally conscious consumers, since collapsing prices “will achieve a slowdown in US shale oil production”, wrote Goldman Sachs analysts. Like extraction of natural gas from shale formations, shale oil production also relies on the controversial drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”. Little impact on renewable energy markets But what about renewable energy markets? Will solar, wind and biomass buckle under the pressure of this low-priced petroleum glut? Historically, lower fossil fuel prices have impacted renewable energy resources like kryptonite – for example in the 1980s and 1990s, when nascent solar, wind and geothermal markets in California keeled over as North America suddenly became awash in cheap oil and natural gas. But energy markets dynamics have changed in the 21st century. In fact, when it comes to electricity, oil and renewables hardly mix at all anymore. That’s because diesel and other petroleum-based fuels account for only 5% of global power generation today, according to the International Energy Agency, compared to a full quarter piece of the pie in 1973. Diesel is even less relevant in US power markets, where it makes up only 1% of generation. “As far as solar and wind go, the [impact] from lower oil prices is zero in North America and Europe, where power prices do not have any link to oil,” said Pavel Molchanov, a senior research analyst at Raymond James Financial, in an email. In some emerging markets for wind and solar, however, such as the Middle East and North Africa, and even in a few established markets such as Japan, diesel does still play a bigger role in power supply – but not big enough to matter much considering current renewable energy prices, according to Molchanov. “In the Middle East, and to a lesser extent post-Fukushima Japan, there is some relevance,” he said. But even at prices below today’s forecasts, “solar can compete effectively with diesel-fired generation”. California-based SunPower, which is majority-owned by French oil giant Total SA, agrees. “The price of oil has almost nothing to do with future demand, even in [the Middle East],” Tom Werner, SunPower’s chief executive, told investment analysts during a conference call last week. “We can price solar energy significantly below diesel-produced electricity,” he claimed. “You have to have substantially lower cost of barrel of oil to even come close to the numbers that you can hit with solar.” ‘Sunlight is essentially free’ Marc van Gerven, vice president of global strategic marketing at rival First Solar, said in an email that solar can provide a competitive advantage over diesel, coal or natural gas because fossil-fuel prices, even if low at this moment, have proven to be quite volatile over time. “Fluctuations in oil prices have little impact on solar or many other renewable energy sources. This is partly why the economic proposition of solar is so compelling, unique and valuable,” he said. “For example, up to 50% of the cost of a fossil plant is the expense of the fuel over the life of the plant, while sunlight is essentially free.” A recent energy cost analysis by Lazard not only backs up these views on oil’s diminutive impact on renewables. It goes further in calculating that the cost of energy from new utility-scale solar and wind power plants is increasingly competitive with more relevant conventional electricity fuels like coal, natural gas and nuclear power, even without subsidies in some markets. One reason for this, the firm found, is that the average long-term cost of large-scale solar energy, for example, has dropped 20% just in the past year and nearly 80% in the last five years. Land-based wind energy costs have fallen by 15% in the last year, and by 60% in the past five years.

Kerry entered what the US described as a \"serious and potentially lengthy conversation\" with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, in a Vienna hotel late on Monday morning, continuing talks adjourned on Sunday night. The discussions come six days before a deadline for completing a comprehensive deal between Iran and six world powers on the future size and shape of an Iranian programme, and at a moment when the talks are deadlocked on a range of issues. The most serious obstacle is a fundamental agreement on whether Iran should have an industrial-scale uranium enrichment capacity, enabling it to be self-sufficient in nuclear fuel for its nuclear power station at Bushehr, or to retain only a research-scale facility and rely on continued fuel imports from Russia, which built the Bushehr reactor. Diplomats said Kerry and Zarif were looking for a compromise that could lead to an agreement by Sunday, or would justify agreeing an extension to the talks in anticipation of a deal. \"There are a lot of issues to discuss as part of these nuclear talks, especially because 20 July is coming up so soon,\" said a senior state department official. \"One of the goals of Secretary Kerry coming to Vienna was to have in-depth discussions with Foreign Minister Zarif to gauge Iran's willingness to make the critical choices it needs to make. That's a pretty serious and potentially lengthy conversation. The secretary will take the time necessary to have that discussion, and that's why they'll be meeting again today, to see if progress can be made.\" Zarif told reporters that the Sunday night talks had made \"some important headway\". Kerry arrived in Vienna soon after Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, appeared to harden Iranian positions, publicly stating the country's demand for an enrichment capacity more than 10 times bigger than its current size. Western diplomats have played down the idea of an extension to the talks, arguing it would be pointless without more signs of flexibility from Tehran. A senior European diplomat said: \"We don't believe an extension will do any good. It's now or never.\" Kerry and Zarif are thought to be discussing the possibility for a phased agreement, in which Iranian enrichment capacity is restricted to a few thousand centrifuges over the next few years, with the prospect of later expansion based on demonstrable need and improved Iranian transparency about the country's nuclear activities. The foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany flew in to Vienna to take part in the talks on Sunday, but left the same evening, leaving Kerry and Zarif to discuss the core issues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/15/geo-al-gore-engineering-climate-disaster-instant-solutio","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-15T18:47:05Z","webTitle":"Al Gore says use of geo-engineering to head off climate disaster is insane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/15/geo-al-gore-engineering-climate-disaster-instant-solutio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/15/geo-al-gore-engineering-climate-disaster-instant-solutio","fields":{"headline":"Al Gore says use of geo-engineering to head off climate disaster is insane","bodyText":"Al Gore said on Wednesday it would be \"insane, utterly mad and delusional in the extreme\" to turn to geo-engineering projects to avoid a climate catastrophe. The UN climate panel, in the next edition of its blockbuster reports, will warn that governments might have to extract vast amounts of greenhouses gases from the air by 2100 to limit climate change, according to a draft copy of the report seen by Reuters. But the former vice president of the US said that searches for an instant solution, which he said were born of desperation, were misguided and could lead to an even bigger catastrophe. \"The idea that we can put a different form of pollution into the atmosphere to cancel out the effects of global warming pollution is utterly insane,\" he told a conference call for South African reporters. He added: \"The fact that some scientists who should know better are actually engaged in serious discussion of those alternatives is a mark of how desperate some of them are feeling due to the paralysis in the global political system.\" In March Gore will expand his climate leadership training programmes to South Africa. He said he believed those leadership training sessions (this is his 24th) had developed a cadre of leaders who were helping to find political solutions for climate change. The draft climate report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, due for release in Germany in April, said governments might have to turn increasingly to technologies for \"carbon dioxide removal\" to keep warming below the dangerous threshold of 2 degrees. The draft said those technologies might involve capturing and burying emissions from coal-fired power plants, or planting more forests. But there has been debate in the environmental community over other more radical solutions. On geo-engineering Gore drew a distinction between small-scale interventions, such as white roofs, and large-scale projects meant to extract or neutralise emissions from the air or block the sunlight. Those ideas, he said, carried enormous risks. \"The most discussed so-called geo-engineering proposals – like putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere to reflect incoming sunlight – that's just insane. Let's just describe that clearly – it is utterly mad,\" Gore told the conference call. He warned that such large and untested experiments carried enormous risks while \"doing nothing to address other consequences of climate change such as ocean acidification\". He said: \"We are already engaged in a planet-wide experiment with consequences we can already tell are unpleasant for the future of humanity. So the hubris involved in thinking we can come up with a second planet-wide experiment that would exactly counteract the first experiment is delusional in the extreme.\" Gore was also cool on the other quick-fix of nuclear power, advocated by some. Late last year four leading US scientists, including the climatologist James Hansen, wrote an open letter urging environmentalists to rethink their opposition to nuclear power. Gore's re-thinking has apparently gone in the other direction. He told the call he had been an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear energy when he was in Congress. He was not opposed to nuclear energy now, he said. But he said the current state of technology in the nuclear energy industry did not yet warrant a big expansion. \"I do believe that it may be possible for scientists and researchers to develop a better and more inherently safer and cheaper form of nuclear reactor, which may yet play a significant role in resolving this crisis,\" he told the call. But he added: \"It is not available now.\" He said he thought such nuclear developments were still 10 or 15 years away. \"Unless there are breakthroughs I think the role of nuclear power is likely to be limited to near the level of contribution it is now,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/feb/02/republicans-climate-change-solutions-senators","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-02T23:27:22Z","webTitle":"Republicans finally admitted climate change is real: so what will they do about it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/02/republicans-climate-change-solutions-senators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/feb/02/republicans-climate-change-solutions-senators","fields":{"headline":"Republicans finally admitted climate change is real: so what will they do about it?","bodyText":"It seemed like a simple idea at first: ask Republicans what they would do about climate change. Late last month, some Republicans in the Senate finally admitted climate change is real. A small minority of 15 Republican senators agreed with the rest of the world that it is caused by human activity. So what were they going to do about it? The senators didn’t know, or they weren’t telling – yet. “You are going to find people very hesitant to talk about this,” an aide to one Republican senator said. The aide was right. Only three of the 15 Republicans came forward with ideas for climate solutions, when asked by the Guardian. Those three Republicans – Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee – suggested a range of measures from building more nuclear power stations, promoting energy efficiency, and encouraging investment in technological research. Crucially, none of the Republicans proposed a target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions – which cause climate change. And none of the Republicans backed Barack Obama’s plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants. They argued Obama was going about fighting climate change all wrong. “My disagreement with the Obama administration is over its wrongheaded approach to solving this problem by proposing to deliberately raise the price of energy and construct a complicated cap-and-trade system,” Alexander said in an emailed statement which also affirmed that human activity was a driver of climate change. His suggestion was to build 100 new nuclear reactors, to provide emissions-free power, and double government-sponsored research. Murkowski opposed building more reactors without first establishing a permanent respository for nuclear waste, a spokesman said. He said she supported “responsible efforts” to reduce emissions. “What Senator Murkowski has said is that we ought to have a no regrets policy that can reduce emissions but also won’t have a negative impact on the American economy, competitiveness and the weekly budgets of American families,” the spokesman said. She opposed a carbon tax. Susan Collins of Maine said the answer was in promoting domestic clean energy and efficiency. “By promoting clean, domestic energy alternatives and efficiency, we can reduce pollution, advance the goal of energy independence for our nation, and spur the creation of new manufacturing jobs in America,” the senator said in a statement. “I’ve always maintained that it is a false choice to pit the environment versus the economy,” she went on. A fourth Republican, John Hoeven of North Dakota, who proposed but eventually voted against one of the climate votes, supported carbon capture technology, a spokesman said. All the other senators were no-shows including John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who have in the past sponsored bills to put economy-wide limits on carbon pollution through cap-and-trade measures. Both of those attempts ended in defeat. But there were signs that the Republican wall of denial about climate change was beginning to come down, said Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who put forward one of the climate change votes in the Senate last month. Those votes – during the debate over the Keystone XL pipeline – for the first time in years saw Republicans abandoning denial to debate policies of climate change. “We shouldn’t be Pollyanas about converting anyone from denier to activist but I think we converted people from denier to non-denier,” Schatz said. “People are going to have to move in increments. You can’t expect people taking a position just about as extreme as you could find would suddenly agree with me on all energy matters.” He went on, “Republicans understand they can’t ignore the problem any more and I think they feel on firmer ground if they disagree on policy rather than a set of facts that is well established.” The votes saw virtually the entire Senate – except for a lone hold-out, Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker – vote that climate change was real and not a hoax. Fifteen Republican senators voted with Democrats that climate change was caused in part by human activity. Five Republican senators voted with Democrats that human activity was the main driver of climate change – which is in line with scientific opinion. Two Republican senators voted with Democrats against a measure seeking to void a US-China deal to cut carbon pollution. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who also proposed a vote on climate change, said the Republicans were now in disarray on the issue. “They are all over the place. There is one who says it’s not even happening. There are the others who say the climate is changing, but we have nothing to do with it. There are others who say the climate is changing and we have something to do with it. And then there are others who say the climate is changing and we have a lot to do with it and we should do something about it,” he said. Whitehouse argued Republicans were now caught between, on one side, powerful corporate interests and the conservative Tea Party wing – which continues to deny the existence of climate change – and on the other, public opinion, which breaks in favour of action on climate change. A number of the Republicans who broke ranks on climate change are from states Obama won in 2012 and are facing tight re-election contests in 2016. “I think the fact that so many felt they needed to vote for the amendments shows that many realise they are being perceived as anti-science and anti-reality and that is not playing that well back home,” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Two-thirds of American voters would reject a candidate who denies the existence of human-caused climate change, according to a Stanford University poll released last week. There could well be other Republicans in Congress who disagree with the party mainstream on climate change – but who are not yet ready to go public, said Jim Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, and a longtime supporter of action on climate change. “I’m sure out of 535 members of Congress there are people in there who agree with me,” he said. “It’s abundantly clear that the climate is changing and we are going to be behind the eight ball on those changes we have to make, and the people who have taken these unrealistic views will not be re-elected.” The 15 Republicans who acknowledged the human contribution to climate change included: Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Five of those senators voted that human activity was a significant cause of climate change. They were: Alexander, Ayotte, Collins, Graham and Kirk. Ayotte and Collins also voted against the measure seeking to void the US-China climate deal and block Obama from pursuing an international climate change treaty. The ideas that have come out from the breakaway Republicans so far do not yet add up to a credible alternative to Obama’s vision for fighting climate change. “They don’t like the EPA rules. They don’t like the cap-and-trade bill,” said Meyer. “They got tired of saying: ‘I am not a scientist’, but it’s not really there yet.” He went on: “It is like AA. The first step is admitting you have a problem. Those 15 Republicans have now admitted: ‘We have a problem.’ The question is: what are we going to do about it?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/11/shale-gas-unlikely-to-make-the-uk-energy-self-sufficient-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-11T17:05:19Z","webTitle":"Shale gas unlikely to make the UK energy self-sufficient, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/11/shale-gas-unlikely-to-make-the-uk-energy-self-sufficient-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/11/shale-gas-unlikely-to-make-the-uk-energy-self-sufficient-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Shale gas unlikely to make the UK energy self-sufficient, says report","bodyText":"Politicians have overhyped fracking’s potential and the prospect of shale gas making Britain self-sufficient in gas again is far-fetched, according to government-funded researchers. The UK became a net importer of gas in 2004 as North Sea production declined, and the coalition has heavily promoted shale gas on the grounds of energy security and economic growth. David Cameron says the UK is “going out all for shale” and on Wednesday the government announced the first ‘national shale gas colleges’. But a new report by academics at the Imperial College-based UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) says significant shale gas production in the UK is unlikely to get underway until next decade and will not reproduce the American ‘shale revolution’ that has put the US on course to energy self-sufficiency. Jim Watson, an author of the report and professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex, said that industry and politicians had “overhyped” the impact shale will have on prices and energy security. “Looking at the evidence base, it’s very hard to support some of the statements made both by industry and some politicians that it’s going to bring down prices, strengthen energy security or create jobs through cheaper energy any time soon. It may have an impact. But a lot depends on how fast shale develops,” he said. The authors are unambiguous that shale gas will not reduce energy prices or reduce the UK’s reliance on gas imports, which are mostly supplied by Norway and Qatar today. “Any talk of shale gas making the UK self-sufficient again, let alone allowing significant exports, is far-fetched,” says the report, The UK’s Global Gas Challenge. It also cautioned against “a blind belief that a future UK shale gas revolution will solve all our problems”. A second report by UKERC warns that by 2025, the time any such shale gas industry is up and running in the UK, global gas consumption must have peaked and begin rapidly tailing off to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. With the development of widespread technology to capture and store the carbon emissions from those gas plants, that deadline moves back to 2035. But carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is so far largely unproven at scale and the world’s first major CCS power plant only switched on last month. UKERC’s report says “whether CCS will actually be commercialised or not is currently far from certain”, though Watson says recent developments in North America mean he is more optimistic than two years ago. The report, A Bridge to a Low-Carbon Future? Modelling the Long-Term Global Potential of Natural Gas, suggests gas’s role as a quick fix to cut carbon emissions – gas emits significantly less CO2 than coal when burned – could be short-lived. Gas has been hailed by some advocates as a ‘bridge’ or ‘transition’ fuel as economies move to renewable energy and nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change. If CCS doesn’t take off, to keep temperature rises under 2C as governments have agreed to do, the report’s modelling showed “gas consumption peaked in 2025 and declined terminally thereafter: the role that gas can play as a transition fuel was thus substantially reduced”. However, despite the short window of opportunity, the authors say the amount of coal that could be displaced by gas is significant in terms of cutting emissions. Dr Christophe McGlade of UCL, who led the modelling work, said: “Gas could play an important role in tackling climate change over the next 10 to 20 years.” Watson added: “In those countries which a have a lot of coal in their energy systems, China being the prime example, gas has a role to play with or without CCS.” He said ensuring gas consumption peaked and declined rapidly in 2025 or 2035 would “require significant policy intervention” from governments. Separately on Tuesday, the Department of Energy and Climate Change announced the creation of the UK’s first specialist colleges for training people for the shale gas industry. Headquartered in Blackpool, the National College for Onshore Oil and Gas National College will be linked to colleges in Chester, Redcar and Cleveland, Glasgow and Portsmouth. Matthew Hancock, the new Tory energy minister, said: “Families, villages and towns across the UK could benefit from this new industry and its supply chain which could create 64,500 jobs. That’s why we are investing in the people behind project. Only by arming people with the skills they need to be shale specialists can we provide career opportunities for thousands of young people, boost the power and competitiveness of our firms and help the UK economy remain strong and competitive. “To make a world-class cluster of expertise in the North West of England, just as Aberdeen is a world class cluster of expertise for offshore oil and gas.” Helen Rimmer, Friends of the Earth north west campaigner said in response: “The north west deserves investment in jobs and skills, but this should be in energy sectors of the future such as tidal, wave and solar which the region has in abundance – not dead-end fossil fuels.” Gas consumption in the UK has already peaked, and development of UK shale gas has been slower than expected. Hydraulic fracturing to extract shale gas will not resume until 2015, the first exploratory fracking in the country since 2011."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/feb/08/renewed-push-for-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-08T21:00:04Z","webTitle":"Letters: Renewed push for nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/08/renewed-push-for-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/feb/08/renewed-push-for-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Renewed push for nuclear power","bodyText":"With one giant leap they are free! How extraordinarily convenient that, just after the nuclear power mega-disaster of Fukushima and just when it is becoming clear around the world that citizens do not want nuclear power and that no one knows how to get rid of the lethal waste, the nuclear industry and government discover we can \"safely\" have enough nuclear power for the next 500 years not only without creating any nuclear waste but also by consuming the nuclear waste we already have in the power creation process (Nuclear waste could fuel new breed of reactors, 3 February). With this miraculous \"new\" process we will make the very embarrassing 35,000 tonnes of depleted uranium and 100 tonnes of plutonium disappear – \"just like that\" to quote another well-known comedian. And to help the story along George Monbiot adds his \"analysis\" (2 February), with the totally misleading statement that we are confronted with a choice between gas and coal, or nuclear power. Renewables, dear George, renewables. Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex • Proponents of integral fast reactors have so far failed to answer three key questions: do these reactors work, how much do they cost, and how long to build? There have been many unsuccessful attempts to build a working fast reactor. The Japanese spent four decades and $13bn trying. A UK fast reactor at Dounreay was a costly failure which we are still working out how to decommission. No one has built a fast reactor on a commercial basis. Even if these latest plans could be made to work, prism reactors do nothing to resolve the main problems with nuclear: the industry's repeated failure to build reactors on time and to budget. Even the Department of Energy and Climate Change's scientific adviser, David MacKay, says \"it isn't the nuclear fuel that's the expensive bit – it's the power stations and the other facilities that go with them.\" We have a very small window in which to get a grip on our greenhouse gas emissions, but despite proven green technologies existing we are being asked to wait while an industry that has a track record for very costly failures researches yet another much-hyped but still theoretical new technology. You can make paper designs for anything, but that is a long way from sorting out the real world engineering and economic issues that will actually deliver affordable and low-carbon energy. That is why ideas like fast reactors work much better in the headlines than they do in fine print. Tom Burke Founding director, E3G, Dr Paul Dorfman Founding co-ordinator, Nuclear Consulting Group, John Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace UK • Oh please. Between 1955 and 1995 the UK blew more than £4bn of taxpayers' money on fast reactors with nothing to show for it but a radioactive mess at Dounreay. The problem is not the reactor. The boilers have thousands of thin metal tubes with water on one side and molten sodium on the other. Every plant of this kind ever built has had boiler leaks with potential hydrogen explosions that make the plant impossible on an electricity system. If General Electric wants to use its own money on this, fine. If it wants to use mine, as a UK taxpayer, count me out. Walt Patterson Associate fellow, Chatham House • The Royal Society welcomes the news that the government is finally taking seriously the issue of how to deal with our country's huge plutonium stockpile. But if it is to press ahead with a new nuclear energy programme, it has to urgently address its lack of a long-term nuclear strategy. This will require restarting a lasting research and development programme for nuclear energy which would be doubly beneficial: future technology options would be left open and we could again attract the best minds to our nuclear industry. The UK lost its world leadership and skills base in fast nuclear reactor R&amp;D following final withdrawal of state support for this research in the mid-1990s. We need experts in and outside government who understand nuclear technology well enough to ensure the UK avoids making the poor decisions dogging its nuclear programme in recent years. Professor Roger Cashmore Chair, Royal Society working group on nuclear non-proliferation and chair of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority • Duncan Clark refers to the development of fast reactor technology by the US government over many decades. But is he unaware of the sodium -cooled fast reactor development carried out in the UK since the 1950s with the experimental fast reactor followed by the Prototype Fast Reactor at Dounreay? Experience with fast reactor development in the UK, US and Japan shows that this is a demanding technology which is still far from a proven commercial reality. Successful experience with a demonstration reactor prototype and working fuel cycle would be needed before real commercial exploitation could be possible. In last year's accident at Fukushima, the reactors were shut down successfully, stopping the fission reaction. However, the loss of off-site power prevented the safe removal of the decay heat from the shut-down reactors. This decay heat continues to be produced by the decay of fission products, after the fission reaction has ceased. It was this decay heat which subsequently caused the reactor melt-down at Fukushima. The requirement to continue to remove decay heat from the reactor core after reactor shutdown is equally necessary in the case of a fast reactor. John Williams London • I am mystified by your online headline 'New generation of nuclear reactors could consume radioactive waste as fuel', as the article discusses using the UK's plutonium stockpile in reactors. The majority of the plutonium (approx 95%) is not actually designated as radioactive waste, but as a nuclear material. Anyone with knowledge of the industry would be aware of this distinction. The processing of plutonium into fuel, and its use in reactors, would however result in more nuclear waste. Once created, this waste would be added to substantial amounts of existing nuclear wastes for disposal – none of which can be used in reactors.

After triumphs at the Department for Work and Pensions he moved to the Ministry of Justice, where his enthusiasm for contracting-out knows no bounds. Most offender management is being outsourced, save for the hardest cases and those involving celebs, which will continue to be supervised by a rump public probation service. Mindful that the coming months may bring regime change, MoJ negotiators have been told to insert into contracts a proviso that if a future government tries to break them, it would have to guarantee contractors the equivalent of the profit they would have made for the duration of the contract. In some cases this could be as much as £400m. So if Labour were elected in 2015 and tried to pull out of Grayling’s probation arrangements, it could face huge financial penalties. Huge financial penalties. A few weeks ago the American company Raytheon won £750m from UK taxpayers after the Home Office pulled out of its busted e-borders contract. So even when the Gray-man is gone, he might cost the nation a pretty penny. • A curious tussle as two groups of politicos descend on Troia, a restaurant close to Westminster. In one corner, Labour types fundraising for Leeds North West parliamentary candidate Alex Sobel. In the other, nine Liberal Democrat MPs celebrating the 60th birthday of Lorely Burt, MP for Solihull. Though the motivation for the Labour gathering was not obvious, it was convivial enough and the Lib Dems were unsurprised when the Labour group – including MPs Stephen Pound and Sadiq Khan – offered a rendition of Happy Birthday in return for a small consideration. John Hemming MP, a man of means, quickly handed over a £10 note. Only when the song was sung did the Labour group reveal that the money would go towards the campaign to usurp the sitting Liberal Democrat, Greg Mulholland. Hemming, aghast, demanded his tenner back. He waits and waits. • And a curious tussle between Friends of the Earth and the BBC, as the latter announces the group has performed a U-turn to embrace nuclear power. The story was prominent on bulletins, and was flagged up as a bit of a scoop ahead of the annual jamboree of the World Nuclear Association in London. But it was all news to Friends of the Earth itself. “I am totally astonished by @BBCr4today inaccuracy. Could our position on nuclear be any clearer?” tweeted campaigns director Craig Bennett ahead of FoE’s demand for a retraction. They are a cynical bunch, these greens, especially when traduced or maligned. They are not over-enamoured of the BBC anyway; a distanced hardly breached by the fact that Diane Coyle, acting chair of the BBC Trust, is also a member of the stakeholder advisory panel of nuclear fatwallets EDF Energy. Her predecessor, Lord Patten, sits on that panel, too. • With the clock ticking down, Francophone French, Swiss and Belgian news bulletins have all been leading on the “Save the union” story. Their reasons are very different. The French love the notion of the UK losing territory. “That’s the most they’ve lost since we took two-thirds in 1066,” said a waspish radio host. The Belgians, however, fear that a yes vote will inspire another brouhaha with Flemish separatists, which may in turn eventually lead to the breakup of Belgium and the rattachement of Wallonia to France. It’s exactly 200 years since Napoleon lost Belgium, which was part of France from 1795-1814. Come 19 September, any number of genies could come floating out of bottles. • Finally, after losing to Tony Blair in the GQ awards, which anointed the former PM and inveterate trouserer philanthropist of the year, we go internet shopping.

Ayatollah Khomeini closes the nuclear programme. 1984 At the height of the war with Iraq, Khomeini changes his mind about the nuclear programme and signs a deal with German partners to complete Bushehr. 1987 TRR is converted from 93%-enriched uranium fuel to just under 20%, which it uses now. January 1995 Iran signs deal with Russia to build new light-water reactors at Bushehr. August 2002 Iran's secret nuclear programme is revealed by a rebel group, Mujahideen e-Khalq, which exposes the existence of the enrichment plant in Natanz and the heavy-water plant in Arak. Iran agrees to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Last week, the number of Green party members in England and Wales passed 22,000 – a 57% increase since 1 January – with the number of young Greens (under-30s) having risen 100% to more than 8,000 since 1 March. Party leader Natalie Bennett told the Observer that the weakness of the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, and the rise of Ukip, all pointed to the next election being the most difficult to predict of recent times, and one in which the Greens could realistically step in and gain half a dozen seats or more. “I think there is a chance that, in 2015, everything just breaks wide open. With the rise of Ukip, not much more than 25% of the vote could win a seat,” she said. The Greens, who currently hold only one seat, Brighton Pavilion, have been steadily creeping up in the polls over recent months. Most national surveys have put them between 4% and 7%, within touching distance of the Lib Dems, who have been struggling to get back into double figures, despite having won 23% of the vote at the 2010 election. Last week, the party said it would take legal action unless it was included in TV debates, arguing that it received 150,000 more votes than the Lib Dems in the 2014 European elections and won three times as many seats as them. Bennett said that as well as defending Brighton Pavilion, where ex-leader Caroline Lucas is the incumbent, the national party has its eye on another 11 seats in England, and it believes winning around six is not out of the question. “I refuse to predict, but I think there is potential for that range [six seats],” she said. Bennett put the recent increase in the Greens’ membership down to disillusionment with the three more established parties and their leaders, and to a sense among more and more voters that they want to back a party they believe in, even if it remains small. “People see Cameron, Miliband and Clegg and say, ‘Well, that is not it.’ They are looking around for something new.” Most Green converts have come from Labour and the Lib Dems, she says. “With the Lib Dems, it is [because of] tuition fees, nuclear power, nuclear weapons and civil rights issues like secret courts. With Labour, it is different. It is that it is still a neo-Thatcherite party and it is still New Labour with the thinnest of rhetorical glosses over the top.” But there also some disappointed Green Tories who, she argues, don’t like fracking and building on the green belt. As the Greens have gained more media attention, Bennett has thought seriously about post-election possibilities, and what role her party might play in supporting a Tory- or Labour-led government. “I can’t imagine circumstances in which we would prop up a Tory government,” she says. “Our first inclination would be a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement, rather than a coalition, because it means you provide stable government – you don’t get the ministerial cars but you keep your conscience and you don’t have to vote for tuition fees, for example.” She is marginally warmer about an alliance with Labour, again probably not in a formal coalition. “We are not enthusiastic about Labour but the choice between [Labour and Tory] is obvious.” The Greens, she says, will be pushing several policy priorities, including plans to lift the minimum wage to £10 by 2020, the renationalisation of the railways when franchises come up for renewal, greater funding for improved home insulation, and the reversal of creeping privatisation of the NHS. Top of the target list will be Norwich South, currently held by the Lib Dems with a wafer-thin majority over Labour, but where the Greens took 14.9% in 2010. A recent poll by Lord Ashcroft put the Greens on 20% in the constituency. Another possibility is Bristol West, where the Lib Dem incumbent, Stephen Williams, is likely to struggle because of the fall-off in the student vote. Then there is St Ives. “Cornwall is very interesting because there is basically no Labour party there, only Tory and Lib Dem, yet it is a place with incredibly low wages and seasonal casual employment so, in the county elections, we got an average of 18% of the vote,” says Bennett. Others on the target list are Sheffield Central (Labour), Liverpool Riverside (Labour), Oxford East (Labour), Solihull (Lib Dem), Reading East (Tory), York Central (Labour), Holborn and St Pancras (Labour) – where Bennett is standing as the candidate – and Cambridge (Lib Dem)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-03T15:06:57Z","webTitle":"Anxious Japan prepares for life without nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure","fields":{"headline":"Anxious Japan prepares for life without nuclear power","bodyText":"This weekend Japan will begin a bold experiment in energy use that no one had thought possible – until the Fukushima Daiichi power plant suffered a triple meltdown just over a year ago. On Saturday, when the Hokkaido electric power company shuts down the No3 reactor at its Tomari plant for maintenance, the world's third-largest economy will be without a single working nuclear reactor for the first time for almost 50 years. The closure of the last of Japan's 54 reactors marks a dramatic shift in energy policy, but while campaigners prepare to celebrate, the nationwide nuclear blackout comes with significant economic and environmental risks attached. The crisis at Fukushima sparked by last year's deadly earthquake and tsunami forced Japan into a fundamental rethink of its relationship with nuclear power. The Tomari shutdown come as the Japan braces itself for a long, humid summer that will have tens of millions of people reaching for the controls of their air conditioners, raising the risk of power cuts and yet more disruption for the country's ailing manufacturers. In a report released this week, the government's national policy unit projected a 5% power shortage for Tokyo, while power companies predict a 16% power shortfall in western Japan, which includes the major industrial city of Osaka. \"I have to say we are facing the risk of a very severe electricity shortage,\" the economy, trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, said, adding that the extra cost of importing fuel for use in thermal power stations could be passed on to individual consumers though higher electricity bills. Before the 11 March disaster, Japan relied on nuclear power for about 30% of its electricity, and there were plans to increase its share to more than 50% by 2030 with the construction of new reactors. The release of huge quantities of radiation into the air and sea, the contamination of the food and water supply and the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents mean that vision of a nuclear-dominant, low-carbon future lies in ruins. Over the past 14 months, dozens of nuclear reactors not directly affected by the tsunami have gone offline to undergo regular maintenance and safety checks, while utilities have turned to coal, oil and gas-fired power plants to keep industry and households supplied with electricity – imports that contribute to Japan's first trade deficit for more than 30 years last year. Japan, already the world's biggest importer of liquefied natural gas, bought record amounts of LNG last year to replace nuclear. The international energy agency estimates the closure of all nuclear plants will increase Japanese demand for oil to 4.5m barrels a day, at an additional cost of about US$100m a day. Last-ditch attempts by the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to win support for the early restart of two reactors at Oi power plant in western Japan have failed amid a hardening of public opposition to nuclear power. None of Japan's idle reactors will be permitted to go back online until they pass stringent \"stress tests\" – simulations designed to test their ability to withstand catastrophic events such as the 14-metre tsunami that knocked out Fukushima Daiichi's backup power supply, and sparked the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. While some experts have criticised the two-stage stress tests as inadequate, an immediate return to even a limited amount of nuclear power now seems impossible. Residents' approval isn't legally required for restarts, but Noda is unlikely to risk the possible political fallout from ignoring local opinion: in a recent poll by Kyodo News, 59.5% are opposed to restarting the Oi nuclear power plant in Fukui prefecture, while 26.7% support it. Leading the push to restart the reactors is Keidanren, Japan's influential business lobby. In a recent survey, 71% of manufacturers said power shortages could force them to cut production, while 96% said that the additional spectre of higher electricity bills would hit earnings. The Japan Institute for Energy Economics has warned that keeping nuclear reactors mothballed could limit GDP growth to just 0.1% this year, as manufacturers cut back production while paying higher prices for crude. Critics of the nuclear shutdown have also highlighted the impact more fossil fuel power generation will have on Japan's climate change commitments. Even big investors in renewables, such as the Softbank chief executive Masayoshi Son, concede it will take time for them to have any real impact on the country's energy mix. They will be buoyed by a new environment ministry panel's assertion that Japan can still reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030 from 1990 levels without nuclear, through energy saving and the quicker adoption of renewables, which it hopes will account for between 25% and 35% of total power generation by 2030. \"If Japan has the motivation, it can do this, too,\" said Sei Kato, deputy director of the environment ministry's low carbon society promotion office. \"We have the technological know-how.\" Short-term risks aside, environmental groups say Saturday's shutdown is an unprecedented opportunity for Japan to wean itself off nuclear power. \"This is a turning point for Japan, and a huge opportunity for it to move towards the sustainable energy future its people demand,\" Greenpeace said in its advanced energy revolution report. \"With an abundance of renewable energy resources and top-class technology, Japan can easily become a renewable energy leader, while simultaneously ending its reliance on risky and expensive nuclear technology.\" On Tuesday, office workers made their contribution with the start, one month earlier than usual, of the annual \"cool biz\" drive to reduce energy use. But swapping suits and ties for short-sleeved shirts, and turning down air conditioners will be easy for as long as Japan enjoys mild spring temperatures. The biggest test of their post-Fukushima resolve has yet to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/01/why-the-energy-has-gone-out-of-tory-green-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-01T12:20:27Z","webTitle":"Why the energy has gone out of Tory green policy | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/01/why-the-energy-has-gone-out-of-tory-green-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/01/why-the-energy-has-gone-out-of-tory-green-policy","fields":{"headline":"Why the energy has gone out of Tory green policy","bodyText":"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but if the Conservative Party has any new ideas on energy or environment it hid them exceptionally well at their party conference. The speeches of prime minister David Cameron, chancellor George Osborne, energy minister Matt Hancock and environment secretary Liz Truss all passed without a single new thought on green matters. The most we learned was that Osborne still thinks fracking is cracking and Truss really, really likes apples. “I will not rest until the British apple is at the very top of the tree,” was her closing, if not rousing, line. Energy minister Baroness Verma made a virtue out of a necessity at a fringe event I chaired on Tuesday. The Tory focus, she said, was on continuing to deliver reform of the energy market, providing stable and steady policy. Of course that’s important in attracting the many billions of pounds of investment needed to build an sustainable energy system. But what about the awful mess the Green Deal energy efficiency scheme is in? Labour made proposals on that. What about the rollercoaster ride endured by solar developers, who are shortly heading back to the courts to challenge ministers? I can think of two explanations as to why the energy has gone out of Conservative green policy. The first is political. Labour’s energy price freeze may have been derided as “economically insane” but it’s hit the bullseye with voters, who loathe the big six as much as their big bills. So the Tories may be choosing to keep their heads down: say nothing about their future energy policy and let others attack Labour. It’s analogous to Labour “forgetting” to speak about the deficit, a weak point for them. The argument in favour of a heads-down strategy is even stronger on the environment. Terrible floods following flood defence budget cuts, the horsemeat scandal, the badger cull and, perhaps most of all, a climate-sceptic environment secretary in Owen Paterson, have made the Tories toxic in many green minds. Ceding energy and environment is risky, but the political calculation may be that it is one worth taking. The other explanation is an ideological horror of state intervention and regulation. The UK had one of the most liberalised energy markets in the world, but the world has changed. Carbon emissions must be cut to tackle climate change and - in the absence of an effective carbon price - the market cannot deliver it. “I am a free marketeer,” one Conservative MP told me. “But we don’t have a free [energy] market.” Free market principles forbid governments from picking winners from nuclear, gas, coal, wind, solar, shale and other energy technologies. This government says it is not, but that is a pretence, another MP said. The special deal cooked up for EDF’s nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point clearly shows that. Bending over backwards to maintain that pretence has led to perverse consequences. The auction for back-up power (so-called capacity) this autumn should support relatively clean gas, but - because ministers don’t pick winners - it will dole out millions to dirty coal. “Why not just ban coal?” asked the MP. Being honest about the interventions needed, while leaving some room in future for the market to deliver lowest-cost power it can, should be possible. But intervention is not Tory instinct. Nonetheless, the party should still use it in specific and vital cases like energy, where market failures exist. Former Conservative energy minister Greg Barker said as much in teasing his Lib Dem boss recently. Barker told the New Statesman he had had “a very good relationship” with energy secretary Ed Davey, but he is “a bit right-wing for me. I would favour slightly more radical market interventions.” Barker ought to know, having overseen the failure of the Green Deal, which was a doomed attempt to create a market in home energy efficiency. Whether the vacuum sucking the oxygen from Tory green policy is due to a heads-down strategy or a difficulty in admitting the state does need to intervene when markets fail, there is still time to fill it before the election. Cameron’s blink-and-you-missed it reference - the UK is “leading not following on climate change” - implies a responsibility for action, not avoidance. So here’s a suggestion. David Cameron wants to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the European Union, so why not add the broken EU emissions trading scheme to his list of Euro wrongs to be righted? A working carbon market that cuts emissions with maximum economic efficiency: what could be more Conservative than that?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2014/dec/10/with-cheap-oil-americans-buy-gas-guzzlers-again","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-10T12:30:09Z","webTitle":"Gas hits $2.67 a gallon and America celebrates by buying gas-thirsty SUVs and trucks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/10/with-cheap-oil-americans-buy-gas-guzzlers-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/dec/10/with-cheap-oil-americans-buy-gas-guzzlers-again","fields":{"headline":"Gas hits $2.67 a gallon and America celebrates by buying gas-thirsty SUVs and trucks","bodyText":"Consider the curse of cheap oil. When energy prices are high, consumers want fuel-efficient autos, and interest in alternative energy from all sources runs hot. When energy prices fall, it’s not so easy being green. Nationwide, gas prices averaged $2.67 a gallon as of Monday, according to AAA – the lowest they’ve been in four years. There’s been a nearly 60-cent drop per gallon in gasoline from this time a year ago. That’s spurred some new-car shoppers to buy gas-guzzling vehicles again. According to November auto sales data, four of the top five sellers were pickup trucks or SUVs, including the Ford F-150 and the Chevy Silverado. Demand for these vehicles rose significantly – 9.6% versus a 1.3% increase in car sales. It’s the paradox of cheap gas: people always want to use more of it – and that may not be great for the economy or the environment. That means consumers also buy fewer hybrid or electric vehicles, and stop urging utilities to use more wind and solar technology. “That is a trend we’ve seen in the US, those purchases follow fuel prices. [Sales of] hybrids go up when gas prices go up. It’s surprising people make those decisions, because you’ll have a car for 15 years, generally,” said Ellen Anderson, director of University of Minnesota’s Energy Transition Lab. Now with the swift fall in crude oil prices – down about 30% this year – will people consider their interest in green energy just another fad, along with pet rocks and crop tops? There’s some encouraging news for the environmentally minded: Cheap gasoline may influence people’s driving habits, but when it comes to other uses of alternative energy, namely in power generation, cheap fossil fuels won’t shut out the gains made in wind and solar. The vast majority of crude oil used in the US is for transportation. Power generation – electricity and home heating – comes mostly from coal, natural gas and nuclear power. “While there might not be direct correlation between oil prices and renewables, there is in people’s perception of renewables”, said Dan Bedell executive vice president, strategic and corporate development at Principal Solar, a solar utility. The US Energy Department said as of 2013, about 13% of electricity generation was green-based. State mandates and tax incentives helped the solar and wind energy industries grow, but what really helped drive down the cost of green energy is scale and technology. A global push – supported by the public – meant more solar panels were installed, and research into better technology improved efficiency. Bedell said when they first installed solar panels for utilities around 2007, the all-in cost – everything that goes into creating a panel – was between $7 to $8 a watt. Now they can install utility-scale panels for $1.50 a watt. Cheaper costs over the past five to six years boosted US solar installations from virtually zero to almost 19 gigawatts now, if you count panels at utilities and those at homes and businesses, said Matt Mooren, with PA Consulting Group. That’s about as much power as 19 large coal-fired power plants. At the wholesale level in certain regions, wind prices can be cheaper than coal, and can remain cost-competitive even when removing subsidies, said Elias Moosa, portfolio manager for energy efficiency at EcoAlpha Asset Management. Research from financial advisory firm Lazard backs up green energy’s competitiveness versus fossil fuels. Comparing the cost of financing, building and operating power-generating plants, Lazard said energy costs from new utility-scale solar plants will be between $72-$86 per megawatt-hour (mwh). Wind is much cheaper: $37 to $81 mwh. That compares to the most-efficient new natural gas plants, at $67 to $127 mwh, and new coal plants, at $66 to $171 mwh. Rooftop solar panels are less competitive because of the higher cost, the Lazard study said, at $180 mwh for homes and $126 mwh for businesses. There are those who dismiss alternative energy’s reliance on subsidies such as tax incentives. Anderson said all forms of energy, whether green energy or oil and natural gas from fossil fuels, receive subsidies. Green energy is now an established part of US energy output, but how much it will grow from current levels is up for debate. The strong push seen a few years ago for more renewable energy has lessened because the US is now using more natural-gas fired power plants rather than coal because of all the gas produced from fracking, said Rashed Haq, vice president of energy and commerce at Sapient Global Markets. Natural gas burns clean and has much less carbon emissions compared with coal, meaning there is now a less-pressing need to reduce emissions via renewables, Haq said. Bedell also said for now the US’s electricity future will be a combination of natural gas and green energy. There are a few events on the horizon that could work in green energy’s favor. One is improvement in battery technology that will allow utilities to store energy – alternative or fossil fuel-based – for peak demand times. Battery technology will also put to rest criticisms of green energy’s intermittency, which is that you can only generate it on sunny days or when it’s windy. That’s why there’s so much interest in Tesla’s plan to build battery infrastructure, Bedell said. It would not only be a boon to electric cars, but also to utility providers. Second, there are big plans to start exporting natural gas, too. If that occurs, it will be a “massive draw on the power supply,” Haq said. That will raise natural gas prices and make more renewables attractive, he said. Finally, Haq said, if the planned Tres Amigas SuperStation in New Mexico can connect the three separate power grids in the US, it would help with renewable adoption. “There are so many wind farms in Texas, when the wind blows, especially at night, we go into negative pricing because nobody wants the generation. At that same time, LA is still pricing high. If you can connect those grids and draw that [power] into LA, [the price] will be zero in Texas and lower in LA,” Haq said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/2013/jan/11/edf-3bn-network-rail-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-11T18:11:21Z","webTitle":"EDF £3bn deal with Network Rail makes trains 'mainly nuclear powered'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/11/edf-3bn-network-rail-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2013/jan/11/edf-3bn-network-rail-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"EDF £3bn deal with Network Rail makes trains 'mainly nuclear powered'","bodyText":"The majority of Britain's trains will be indirectly running on nuclear power for the next 10 years following Network Rail's agreement to a £3bn deal with EDF to supply electricity to the railways.

But genital art elicited a very different response in Japan this week, when police arrested an artist for distributing data that enables recipients to make 3D prints of her vagina. The artist, who works under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko – which roughly translates as “good-for-nothing girl” – was arrested after emailing the data to 30 people who had answered a crowd-funding request for her recent artistic venture: a kayak inspired on her own genitalia she calls “pussy boat”, according to Brian Ashcraft at the gaming website Kotaku. The artist, whose real name is Megumi Igarashi, was held in custody in Tokyo on suspicion of breaking Japanese obscenity laws. Media reports said Igarashi, 42, denied the allegations. She pointed out that had not sent images of her vagina in return for money and did not recognise the scanned 3D data as obscene. Kyodo quoted unnamed police sources as saying Igarashi had collected about 1m yen in exchange for the data. While Igarashi's art has a fun-loving and cheeky theme, her situation is serious as far as the law is concerned: if convicted she could receive up to two years in jail or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen (£14,300/US$24,500), according to her lawyer. Commentators have pointed out the hypocrisy of her arrest, which comes soon after Japanese authorities resisted pressure to ban pornographic images of children in manga comics and animated films. The activist Minori Kitahara said police raided Igarashi's office and seized 20 of her artworks. \"Japan is still a society where those who try to express women's sexuality are suppressed, while men's sexuality is overly tolerated,\" she said. Igarashi has made a name for herself with her Decoman “Decorated Vagina” series of sculptures. The titles of the works incorporate the word “man”, from manko, the Japanese for vagina. Igarashi said she was once asked not to use the word Decoman during a TV appearance. Because female genitalia were “overly hidden” in Japanese society, “I did not know what a pussy should look like,” she said in an online post. “I thought it was just funny to decorate my [moulded] pussy and make it a diorama, but I was very surprised to see how people get upset to see my works or even to hear me say manko.” One of the works, described as a “vaginal battle scene”, shows a group of toy soldiers taking cover in an unmistakeably pudic crevice; another diorama titled Fukushiman – a “taboo on top of taboo” – shows workers at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in similar surroundings. She has also designed iPhone covers and recently posted an image of Gundaman, a figurine based on the popular anime character Gundam, sporting an oversized vagina, according to the Japanese art and design website Spoon &amp; Tamago. Igarashi has said she is on a mission to “demystify” female genitalia in Japan, a country where thousands flock to an officially sanctioned annual penis festival in Kawasaki every April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/05/green-party-left-uk-politics-caroline-lucas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-05T04:00:15Z","webTitle":"Green party to position itself as the real left of UK politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/05/green-party-left-uk-politics-caroline-lucas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/05/green-party-left-uk-politics-caroline-lucas","fields":{"headline":"Green party to position itself as the real left of UK politics","bodyText":"The Green party is positioning itself as the “real opposition” to the coalition, opening up a bitter fight with Labour on the left wing of UK politics, as the party’s key figures prepare to contest general election seats in parliament. Caroline Lucas, the party’s only MP, will tell the Green party conference in Birmingham on Saturday that Labour has failed to oppose the Tories and Liberal Democrats on a wide variety of issues, from the creeping privatisation of the National Health Service to free schools, tougher immigration rules and the renationalisation of the UK’s rail network. “Labour has not only consistently failed to challenge the illiterate economics of George Osborne’s slash and burn approach to public spending, but Ed Balls [shadow chancellor of the exchequer] has signed up to the same spending limits as the government itself,” she will tell party activists gathering at Aston University as the party conference season kicks off. “Secret courts as part of the justice and security bill? Labour refused to oppose [them]. On the appallingly illiberal immigration bill, they abstained. They support workfare sanctions. Even on the issue of bringing the railways back into public ownership – a hugely popular policy – Labour has flunked it.” Environmental issues are to be barely given a mention in her keynote speech, which will concentrate on social justice, inequality and civil liberties. She will slam the Tories for “talking openly of getting rid of green crap, offering tax breaks for fracking, boasting of getting every last drop of oil from the North Sea, even as climate change accelerates”, and reiterate the Green party’s opposition to fracking for oil and gas and to nuclear power and weapons. But most of her speech is reserved for strident criticism of Labour’s current spell in opposition. Lucas holds the Brighton Pavilion seat in Westminster, the party’s first, gained at the last general election after years when the party scored well in European elections, with more than a million Green votes cast, and some local elections, but had historically failed to make a dent in Westminster. But her seat will be strongly contested by Labour in next May’s general election. Labour is understood to view the Brighton seat as one of its most winnable. Another Labour stronghold, the inner London constituency of Holborn and St Pancras, is also a key Green target. The party’s leader, former Guardian journalist Natalie Bennett, will stand there in the hopes of an upset following the retirement of the long-standing Labour MP Frank Dobson. Every seat will be crucial for Labour in next year’s election, as polls continue to show only a narrow gap between the two main parties, with a strong chance of another hung parliament. Support for the Lib Dems has retreated since they took up the junior position in the current ruling coalition. A vote for Scottish independence would throw the party’s strategy further into doubt, as it would raise the prospect of the loss of Scottish Labour seats, which would be a serious blow to hopes of forming a government. Labour will also face a fight on the left from the Green party in seats in Manchester, Oxford, Bristol and Norwich. Lucas will say she wants to “demonstrate that our result in Brighton in 2010 wasn’t a one-off”. She will also point to the recent successes of Ukip, in an effort to galvanise voters to support her party. “They are knocking on the door of parliament. Imagine if they are in the next parliament and we are not. What a terrible message that would send out about the direction in which this country is going.” Bennett, who will speak on Friday afternoon, will tell the conference that voter apathy and low turn-outs reflect a lack of distinct policies among the main parties. “Voters are desperate for alternatives to the three business-as-usual parties. Voters understand our current model is broken, our economy and society are failing to meet our needs. The coalition has governed for those who think prestige and personal wealth is more important than fairness and a decent life for everyone. This government has allowed giant, tax-dodging, low-paying, exploitative multinational companies to act at the direct expense of individual workers and communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/may/15/renewable-energy-horrors-coal-extraction-turkish-mine-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-15T19:34:58Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy won't rid us of the horrors of coal | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/15/renewable-energy-horrors-coal-extraction-turkish-mine-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/may/15/renewable-energy-horrors-coal-extraction-turkish-mine-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy won't rid us of the horrors of coal","bodyText":"If 300 workers were to die in a nuclear accident or a shale gas blast, such an energy source would be doomed. Not so coal. Coal is the filthiest and most polluting form of energy, and the most dangerous to extract. I recall my Welsh grandfather boasting that none of his sons had \"gone down the pit\". Yet coal continues to exert a mesmeric hold on the world's imagination, especially on the left. Labour supported Arthur Scargill's determination to keep pits open. The party prevented Tony Blair from building any nuclear power stations, instead tipping subsidies into wind, which merely encouraged Britain's dependency on coal, now at 38% and rising. Global coal consumption is at its highest level since 2006, and mocks all attempts at emissions discipline. The past two decades of a \"rush to renewables\" remains a conundrum of modern government. Wind clearly generates electricity, which is good, but not much – and at a cost that has led to an extraordinary shift in wealth from poor to rich in public finance. In most of Europe, wind power has driven up fuel poverty and made dozens of landowners multimillionaires. A KPMG report to government in 2011 suggested that a similar cut in emissions could be achieved by switching to gas and nuclear, at a reported saving of £34bn. The prospect of a bandwagon loaded with subsidy (wind) crashing head-on into another loaded with profit (oil) has not been conducive to calm debate. All the two sides can agree on is paranoia about nuclear. After Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011, in which no one died, Germany was so panicked that it closed all its nuclear sites. This in turn meant frantic investment in German coal and lignite – 10 new plants are said to be opening – and a surge in Polish coal output. The latter may spend ¤20bn a year on renewables subsidies, involving an 80% rise in real energy prices since 2000, but the need to back these up with conventional capacity means that the chief beneficiary of Fukushima was coal. Germany's carbon emissions are rising by between 5% and 7% a year. Meanwhile, the continued identification of nuclear power with nuclear weapons – and now with the prospect of a terrorist dirty bomb – has long underpinned the left's opposition to it. Anyone involved should take an icepack and sit down to read Wade Allison's Radiation and Reason as an antidote. There have been few such potent alliances as the anti-nuclear lobby, Big Carbon and the Saudis driving up the cost of nuclear. The beneficiary, again, has been coal. Anyone who dares talk or write on this subject is scrutinised for tribal loyalties. Where is he coming from? Who must be paying him? I must have spent hundreds of man-hours attempting to keep abreast of the debate, struggling to remain loyal to planet reason. All I have concluded is that most sensible people – though not all – think the climate is changing, and that the precautionary principle suggests concerted action to combat it. But the \"renewables ascendancy\", culminating in the hysteria of the first International Panel on Climate Change report, was a disaster. It saw any carbon combustion or nuclear reaction as equally evil, and any sun, wind or wave power as equally good – however costly. Pleas from energy experts such as Oxford's Dieter Helm for economic literacy fell on deaf ears. \"Announcing a policy does not solve a problem,\" he said of the IPCC report in despair. For its part, coal is treated as a curiously tolerable rogue. Soaring Chinese and Indian consumption is taken as an inevitable consequence of poverty. British politicians, infatuated after visiting China, rarely mention that the basis of this growth is vast supplies of coal. The Chinese used 1.5bn tonnes of the stuff in 2000, and now use more than 4bn. This utterly swamps any western attempt at mitigation. The death rate among Chinese miners may be down from about 6,000 a year at the turn of the century, but is still beyond 1,000 a year. In the great debate over mitigation and adaptation, the adaptors now appear to be winning. Last March's report from the IPCC marked a dramatic shift. Given that the campaign to reduce emissions has largely failed, money is now better spent on softening the impacts of global warming and helping those directly affected. As one of the few heroes of the debate, James Lovelock points out in his book Revenge of Gaia, the world's systems are \"adjustable for whatever is the current environment, adaptable to what forms of life it carries.\" The Turkish disaster reminds us not just of the human cost of coal, but also the cost of hysteria-led policy. Gas is a carbon-based source of energy but can be twice or three times less polluting than coal – and does not require hundreds of people to die each year extracting it. The \"dash for gas\" has made America the only big country to actually reduce emissions since Kyoto. I am more persuaded by the fact of global warming than by it being a long-term existential threat to life on Earth. I am more of an adaptor. Even so, it makes sense to turn to fuels which are less polluting and dangerous to get than coal, while always seeking to innovate and curb energy use. But if I am wrong and warming is indeed a threat to survival, then mitigation becomes urgent. In which case a dash to gas and nuclear is vital. Above all, we should avoid spending money on intermittent renewables. They may appear to be a solution. In fact, they create an ever-rising need for deadly coal as a supplement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/15/fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-cleanup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-15T15:15:00Z","webTitle":"Plummeting morale at Fukushima Daiichi as nuclear cleanup takes its toll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/15/fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-cleanup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/15/fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-cleanup","fields":{"headline":"Plummeting morale at Fukushima Daiichi as nuclear cleanup takes its toll","bodyText":"Dressed in a hazardous materials suit, full-face mask and hard hat, Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, left his audience in no doubt: \"The future of Japan,\" he said, \"rests on your shoulders. I am counting on you.\" Abe's exhortation, delivered during a recent visit to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, was only heard by a small group of men inside the plant's emergency control room. But it was directed at almost 6,000 more: the technicians and engineers, truck drivers and builders who, almost three years after the plant suffered a triple meltdown, remain on the frontline of the world's most dangerous industrial cleanup. Yet as the scale of the challenge has become clearer with every new accident and radiation leak, the men working inside the plant are suffering from plummeting morale, health problems and anxiety about the future, according to insiders interviewed by the Guardian. Even now, at the start of a decommissioning operation that is expected to last 40 years, the plant faces a shortage of workers qualified to manage the dangerous work that lies ahead. The hazards faced by the nearly 900 employees of Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] and about 5,000 workers hired by a network of contractors and sub-contractors were underlined this month when six men were doused with contaminated water at a desalination facility. The men, who were wearing protective clothing, suffered no ill health effects in the incident, according to Tepco, but their brush with danger was a sign that the cleanup is entering its most precarious stage since the meltdown in March 2011. Commenting on the leak, the head of Japan's nuclear regulator, Shunichi Tanaka, told reporters: \"Mistakes are often linked to morale. People usually don't make silly, careless mistakes when they're motivated and working in a positive environment. The lack of it, I think, may be related to the recent problems.\" The radiation spill was the latest in a string of serious water and radiation leaks, which have raised fears over the workers' state of mind – and Tepco's ability to continue the cleanup alone. According to sources with knowledge of the plant and health professionals who make regular visits, the slew of bad news is sapping morale and causing concern, as the public and international community increase pressure on Japan to show demonstrable progress in cleaning up the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. \"Very little has changed at Fukushima Daiichi in the past six months,\" said Jun Shigemura, a lecturer in the psychiatry department at the National Defence Medical College who heads of a team of psychologists that counsels Fukushima plant workers. \"Tepco is doing its best to improve matters, but you can see that the situation is severe.\" Shigemura is most concerned about the 70% of Tepco workers at Fukushima Daiichi who were also forced to evacuate their homes by the meltdown. They have yet to come to terms with that loss and many live away from their families in makeshift accommodation near the plant. \"They were traumatised by the tsunami and the reactor explosions and had no idea how much they had been irradiated,\" Shigemura said. \"That was the acute effect but now they are suffering from the chronic effects, such as depression, loss of motivation and issues with alcohol.\" Their anxiety is compounded by uncertainty over the future of their embattled employer. Tepco is coming under mounting pressure to resolve the worsening water crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, which recently prompted the government to step in with half a billion dollars (£312m) to help contain the build-up of toxic water. Its ability to stem the water leaks by the time Tokyo hosts the Olympics in 2020 – as promised by Abe – could be hampered by a looming labour shortage. As Tepco was reducing costs and attempting to calm public anger over its handling of the crisis, it imposed a 20% pay cut for all employees in 2011. From a total workforce of 37,000, 1,286 people left the firm, between April 2011 and June this year. The firm did not hire any employees in fiscal 2012 and 2013. The utility plans to take on 331 employees next April, according to Mayumi Yoshida, a Tepco spokeswoman. \"[The employment] system will change so it will be easier for talented employees to gain promotion and for unproductive employees to be demoted,\" she said. But there is little the firm can do about the departure of experienced workers, forced to leave after reaching their radiation exposure limit. Tepco documents show that between March 2011 and July this year, 138 employees reached the 100-millisievert [mSv] threshold; another 331 had been exposed to between 75 mSv and 100 mSv, meaning their days at the plant are numbered. Those nearing their dose limit have reportedly been moved to other sites, or asked to take time off, so they can return to work at Fukushima Daiichi at a later date. Some workers have left because of exhaustion and stress, while others have decided to find work closer to their displaced wives and children. \"They are less motivated and are worried about continuing to work for a firm that might not exist in a decade from now,\" Shigemura said. Workers who have stayed on do so in the knowledge that they risk damaging their health through prolonged exposure to radiation and in accidents of the kind that occurred this week. Earlier this year, Tepco said that 1,973 workers, including those employed by contractors and subcontractors, had estimated thyroid radiation doses in excess of 100 mSv, the level at which many physicians agree the risk of developing cancer begins to rise. \"These workers may show a tiny increased risk of cancer over their lifetimes,\" said Gerry Thomas, professor of molecular pathology at Imperial College, London University. \"One hundred millisieverts is the dose we use as a cut-off to say we can see a significant effect on the cancer rate in very large epidemiology studies. The numbers have to be large because the individual increase is minuscule.\" But she added: \"I would be far more worried about these workers smoking or feeling under stress due to the fear of what radiation might do to them. That is much more likely to have an effect on any person's health.\" While Thomas and other experts have cautioned against reaching hasty conclusions about a possible rise in thyroid cancer among Fukushima Daiichi workers, there is little doubt that their punishing work schedule, performed under the international spotlight, is taking a toll on their health. \"I'm particularly worried about depression and alcoholism,\" said Takeshi Tanigawa, a professor in the department of public health at Ehime University in western Japan. \"I've seen high levels of physical distress and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\" Many of the casual labourers employed by subcontractors live in cheap accommodation in places such as Yumoto, a hot-spring resort south of the exclusion zone around the plant. The number of workers has declined in the past year amid complaints from hoteliers and inn-keepers about drink-fuelled fights. These days, more seem to prefer the bars and commercial sex establishments of nearby Onahama port. A 42-year-old contract worker, who asked not be named, confirmed that alcohol abuse had become a problem among workers. \"Lots of men I know drink heavily in the evening and come to work with the shakes the next day. I know of several who worked with hangovers during the summer and collapsed with heatstroke.\" \"There isn't much communication between workers. People want to look after number one. Newcomers are looked down on by their colleagues and some don't really know how to do their jobs.\" Another worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had seen hungover colleagues collapse with heatstroke just minutes after beginning work. In the long term, Tepco and its partner companies will struggle to find enough people with specialist knowledge to see decommissioning through to the end, according to Yukiteru Naka, a retired engineer with General Electric who helped build some of Fukushima Daiichi's reactors. \"There aren't enough trained people at Fukushima Daiichi even now,\" he said. \"For Tepco, money is the top priority – nuclear technology and safety come second and third. That's why the accident happened. The management insists on keeping the company going. They think about shareholders, bank lenders and the government, but not the people of Fukushima.\" Naka, who runs a firm in Iwaki, just south of Fukushima Daiichi, that provides technical assistance to Tepco, said the lack of expertise afflicts the utility and general contractors with a pivotal role in the cleanup. \"Most of their employees have no experience of working in conditions like these, and all the time their exposure to radiation is increasing,\" he said. \"I suggested to Tepco that it bring in retired workers who said they were willing to help, but the management refused.\" Faced with labour shortages and a string of accidents, Tepco has in recent weeks come under pressure to accept more specialist help from overseas. At the start of this month, Shinzo Abe, told an international science conference in Kyoto: \"My country needs your knowledge and expertise.\" But this apparent spirit of openness is unlikely to turn the decommissioning operation into a genuinely international effort, said Ian Fairlie, a London-based independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment. \"Japanese officials ask for help, but Tepco and the government are not in the business of saying: 'This is serious, please come and help us,'\" he said. Tepco's unshakable belief in its ability to complete the decommissioning operation rules out any meaningful co-operation, even with Japanese government officials. \"Tepco has always wanted to do its own thing,\" said Akihiro Yoshikawa, a Tepco employee of 14 years who recently left the company. \"It doesn't want the government stepping in and telling it what to do; it just wants the government's money.\" Yoshikawa said the spirit of resilience his former colleagues had displayed in the aftermath of the accident had turned to despondency amid mounting criticism at home and abroad, forcing younger workers to leave and older ones to take early retirement. \"They felt like they were being bullied, even though they were putting their lives at risk,\" he said. \"Tepco is spending its money on fixing the technical problems, but it also needs people to carry out that work. I'm very worried about the labour shortage. If they don't do something about it soon, the employment system at Fukushima Daiichi will collapse first, not the plant.\" For the thousands of non-Tepco employees hired across Japan to perform backbreaking, dangerous work for contractors and subcontractors, the lure of earning decent money in return for working close to lethal levels of radiation has proved an illusion. Once money for accommodation has been subtracted from their wages, labourers are typically left with a few thousand yen at the end of each day. In some cases, smaller companies withhold danger money, which can amount to more than half of a worker's daily wage because, they say, they need the extra cash to keep their business afloat. The poor pay has forced growing numbers of men to quit and take up jobs decontaminating the area around the plant, for which they can earn similar momey but with much less exposure to radiation. \"The real work at Fukushima Daiichi is being done by the general contractors, with the smaller companies picking up the crumbs,\" Yoshikawa said. \"They outbid each other for contracts and so end up with less money to pay their workers. They have no choice but to hire cheap labour.\" Conditions for Tepco workers living in J Village – a football training complex just south of Fukushima Daiichi – have only recently improved. For two years after the disaster, those living in prefabricated units at J Village had to walk hundreds of metres to use communal toilets at night. Tepco belatedly installed private toilets earlier this year after the firm's incoming president, Naomi Hirose, heeded health experts' warnings that the lack of facilities was compromising employees' health. \"The managers at Tepco headquarters have little idea of how their Fukushima Daiichi employees live,\" said Tanigawa, the public health professor. \"The company's management is focused on the compensation problem and doesn't want to be accused of only looking after its own when there are still evacuees who haven't been compensated.\" But as concern grows over Tepco's ability to address the myriad technical challenges facing Fukushima Daiichi – starting next month with the removal of 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from the top of reactor No 4 – the unfolding human crisis is being largely ignored. There is still no full-time mental health counselling available at the plant, said Shigemura, whose team visits about once a month to talk to workers and administer pharmacological treatments. \"That amazes me,\" he said. \"Tepco workers worry about their health, but also about whether Tepco will take care of them if they fall ill in the future. They put their lives and their health on the line, but in the years to come, they wonder if they will just be discarded.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/feb/19/cannot-afford-nuclear-power-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-19T12:59:44Z","webTitle":"We cannot afford not to have nuclear in our low-carbon energy mix | James Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/19/cannot-afford-nuclear-power-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/19/cannot-afford-nuclear-power-energy-mix","fields":{"headline":"We cannot afford not to have nuclear in our low-carbon energy mix","bodyText":"The euphoric phase on low-carbon energy is over. There is no solution that is clean and cheap and always on. Yet we must make major investments in energy. Old coal and nuclear plants will have to close. And climate change has to be tackled or it will result in costly economic damage. So let's consider the options for investment in low-carbon electricity. Over the coming 20 years there are only three options that are relevant – wind, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear. Each has significant imperfections yet each works. And there is no muddle through option. Each technology has deeply entrenched opponents. But if all the opponents have their way, we are left with no solution. Or at a minimum there will be a long period of argument, muddle and delay, followed by a rushed, expensive and late period of investment. Isn't that how it is already feeling? Let's consider the three energy technology options in turn. Each is a different kind of curate's egg. The great thing about wind is that it is free. The bad thing about wind is we cannot control its availability Deeply cold anticyclones in winter are widespread, windless and can last for days. So if we build lots of wind-based power, we have to build lots of gas-fired backup which will bring some extra cost. This is starkly evident in the recently published gas strategy from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc). The right balance must be struck. Energy storage and demand management will help but will not be panaceas. The further offshore we go, the bigger the windfarms can be. That is good news, but it means more costly foundations and cables. The Carbon Trust is working with industry on innovations to bring these costs down. It would be a big help if there was more acceptance of onshore wind. It is fundamentally cheaper than offshore wind. CCS has few friends and no natural owner. CCS is a nuisance on a gas-fired power station. It creates complexity and reduces flexibility. It adds about 50% to the all-in unit cost of gas-based electricity. CCS perpetuates fossil fuel use and leaves us open to gas price fluctuations in the long run. Critics say CCS is not commercial. But, despite the complications, if CCS, once demonstrated at scale, were to receive the current subsidy for offshore wind, Decc, I would wager, would have a queue of CCS investors at its door. Globally, because coal and gas are relatively cheap and will be used, if we don't have CCS, we can't stop damage to the climate. Nuclear can deliver enormous quantities of low-carbon power. It can't ramp up and down as demand fluctuates through day and night. But nuclear offers a secure base load. On paper, nuclear seems to offer the cheapest low-carbon carbon electricity. But new plants being built in Finland and France are taking far longer to build and costing far more than budgeted. It looks too that the cost estimates for new nuclear plants in the UK are soaring. With its enormous capital cost and the risk of project overruns it is hard to find willing investors for nuclear. We worry about lack of competition but EDF deserve credit for hanging in there. So where does this leave us? There are no emotional highs with any of these technologies. They are hard work and more costly than current technologies. But, imperfect though they are, these low-carbon technologies work. And, though more costly, the cost of climate damage looks likely to be higher. Also, it is clear that at least any two of these technologies will have to be deployed if our energy and carbon reduction targets are to be met. Looking at it another way, diversification makes sense and the weaknesses of each option tend to be compensated by the strengths of another. In short, it is best if we have all three. But of course we can't write blank cheques on any of these technologies. The focus has fallen on nuclear, particularly with Centrica pulling out of the nuclear joint venture with EDF. There is a decent case that the consumer takes some of the risk to get the first few nuclear plants going. Let's hope that Decc has enough tools in its negotiating kitbag. They need to get the balance right in creating incentives for EDF to deliver, to shoulder a realistic level of risk but not to earn super profits. Both Decc and EDF know that paying a high price for the first few nuclear plants can only make sense if it represents a credible pathway to lower costs in future. As consumers we should have two serious worries if nuclear prices itself out of the energy market. Firstly the benefits to innovation and cost control that come from inter-technology competition would be much diminished. Secondly a key source of diversification of risk to our energy system would be lost. The outcome could be a more costly and risky energy system. Like the other technologies, nuclear has to prove itself in cost terms. But we should not be thinking of giving up now. • James Smith is the chair of Carbon Trust and former chair of Shell UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/19/irish-charity-legal-challenge-hinkley-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-19T20:57:20Z","webTitle":"Ireland's 'National Trust' throws down legal challenge over Hinkley N-plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/19/irish-charity-legal-challenge-hinkley-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/19/irish-charity-legal-challenge-hinkley-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Irish greens fight UK nuclear plan in court","bodyText":"One of Ireland's leading environmental groups is taking legal action against the British government, claiming that it has failed to consult the Irish people on its next generation of nuclear power stations, which it says could have a big impact on Irish citizens' lives if there are leaks or accidents. The government has given approval for the £14bn Hinkley Point C plant, to be built by the French energy company EDF, which operates eight of Britain's existing nuclear power stations. The new plant will produce around 7% of the UK's electricity. An Taisce, Ireland's equivalent of the National Trust, will go to the high court in London in December to seek a judicial review challenging the legality of the decision by Ed Davey, the energy secretary, to grant permission to build the plant, which will be 150 miles from the Irish coast. The group is questioning whether the development complies with both the EU's Environmental Impact Assessment directive and the UK's own regulations on trans-boundary impacts and consultation. A spokesman for An Taisce denied that the move was a PR stunt that had little chance of success, pointing out that, as a charity, it had a duty to think hard before taking legal action. \"Despite the nuclear power plant being nearer to the coast of Ireland than it is to Leeds, the UK decided not to consult with the Irish public about the decision before it granted consent in March,\" An Taisce said in a statement. \"The first time many Irish people learned about the nuclear power plant proposal was when the decision was announced.\" Greenpeace has launched a separate legal challenge on the grounds that the government has not said where it will deposit the plant's nuclear waste. In February, Cumbria county council withdrew from the process to find a long-term storage site for the UK's spent nuclear fuel, leaving the government without a location for the new waste. The United Nations is also taking a close interest in the plant's development in response to concerns raised by green parties in several European countries which complain that the UK has failed to consult adequately. A UN committee will examine whether the plant poses environmental threats that fail to respect national borders. In addition, the European commission must decide whether the UK is allowed to offer nuclear power consortiums an agreed \"strike price\" for their electricity, which critics say equates to a subsidy and is anti-competitive. It is understood that the UK will buy electricity from Hinkley C at £93 per megawatt-hour – double the current wholesale price. Hinkley Point is seen as a test case that will set a precedent for other EU states, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, which are keen to expand their nuclear power programmes. After recent announcements on energy price rises, the government is desperate to press on with nuclear plant construction as it seeks to diversify the UK's power supplies. The chancellor, George Osborne, was in China last week wooing power companies to take stakes in the UK's new nuclear plants. Success in obtaining a judicial review could delay construction of Hinkley and scare off investors. The Department of Energy has said it is not expecting any delay to the project and insists that the plant's construction has taken \"full account of applicable EU and other international law\". Irish governments have in the past asked London to close the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria over concerns about pollution of the Irish Sea and fears that an accident could harm Ireland's environment severely. A request by Dublin at a UN tribunal for the plant's closure was rejected. An Taisce admitted that it saw the judicial review as being about more than Hinkley Point C. The charity said the court's decision was important \"not only in respect of this nuclear power plant, but also [for] the manner in which other decisions will be treated, including the nuclear plant proposed for Anglesey, which is even closer to Ireland and in an area prone to earthquakes\". News of potential legal action will add to concerns about costs and delays affecting the rollout of the UK's nuclear programme. Last week the National Audit Office published a rexport that found there had been significant delay and cost escalation to 12 of the 14 large projects at Sellafield. The schedules of seven projects in the planning phase had been put back 57 months and costs had risen by £601m since the projects had started, the NAO found."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/10/price-electricity-double-next-20-years-national-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-09T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Price of electricity could double over next 20 years, says National Grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/10/price-electricity-double-next-20-years-national-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/10/price-electricity-double-next-20-years-national-grid","fields":{"headline":"Price of electricity could double over next 20 years, says National Grid","bodyText":"The price of electricity could double over the next two decades, according to forecasts published on Thursday by the National Grid, the company responsible for keeping Britain's lights on. The current price of wholesale electricity is below £50 per megawatt hour but could soar to over £100 by 2035 under a \"high case\" example used in the Grid's UK Future Energy Scenarios report. The group, which is the main pipes and pylons operator in England and Wales, predicts the wholesale gas price could rise from 70p per therm to around 100p per therm under another high case scenario. The cost of electricity has already risen 20% since 2009 and the company blames future increases on the number of coal-fired power stations being closed plus the cost of subsidising wind farms. \"Electricity prices for the high case and base case scenarios are assumed to increase over the next few years due to decreasing margins as coal-fired plants retire due to the Large Combustion Plants Directive [European anti-pollution] legislation and some gas-fired plants are mothballed,\" says the document. \"All prices increase post-2020 as the costs of low carbon generation increasingly factor into the power price,\" it adds. The Grid admits the estimates are based on the lowest \"baseload\" cost at which the electricity is available rather than any \"peak\" costs during periods of high demand. The latest forecasts – although combined with more modest price rises under different scenarios – will worry householders and energy-intensive businesses already struggling with the impact of higher bills. The government has found itself caught in an awkward bind of needing to offer incentives to draw in investors to replace polluting coal and ageing nuclear plants at a time when it tries to meet higher carbon reduction targets. A slump in North Sea gas and oil production due to fields running dry has also encouraged the government to support a controversial shale gas drive in a bid to match a US boom in this kind of fuel. The Grid now says that more than 40% of Britain's gas needs could under some circumstances be met by indigenous shale extraction by 2035, but declined to say whether it would have any impact on prices. The company says failure to invest much more in local gas production, whether onshore or in the North Sea, would leave the country 90% dependent on imports within two decades. In previous years the Grid has made no real assessment of the power of shale gas in Britain to affect the wider energy landscape, but a spokesman said it was time to do so given the data now available from the British Geological Survey and others. \"We have a lot more information on shale gas on which to base our assumptions, which range from providing zero under the 'no progression' scenario up to 41% by 2035 in a 'low-carbon life scenario',\" said a spokesman for the Grid. The possible rise in future electricity prices to over £100 could help justify government plans to pay £89.50 per megawatt hour subsidy or \"strike price\" to EDF Energy to produce electricity from a proposed new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset from 2023."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/dec/16/nuclear-scare-stories-coal-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-16T20:45:01Z","webTitle":"Nuclear scare stories are a gift to the truly lethal coal industry | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/16/nuclear-scare-stories-coal-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/16/nuclear-scare-stories-coal-industry","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear scare stories are a gift to the truly lethal coal industry","bodyText":"Most of the afflictions wrongly attributed to nuclear power can rightly be attributed to coal. I was struck by this thought when I saw the graphics published by Greenpeace on Friday, showing the premature deaths caused by coal plants in China. The research it commissioned suggests that a quarter of a million deaths a year could be avoided if coal power there were shut down. Yes, a quarter of a million. Were Greenpeace to plot the impacts of nuclear power on the same scale, the vast red splodges depicting the air pollution catastrophe suffered by several Chinese cities would be replaced by dots invisible to the naked eye. This is not to suggest that there are no impacts, but they are tiny by comparison. The World Health Organisation's analysis of the Fukushima disaster concludes that \"for the general population inside and outside of Japan ... no observable increases in cancer rates above baseline rates are anticipated\". Only the most contaminated parts of Fukushima prefecture are exposed to any significant threat: a slight increase in the chances of developing cancer. Even the majority of the emergency workers have no higher cancer risk than that of the general population. And this, remember, was caused by an unprecedented disaster. The deaths in China are caused by business as usual. The tiny risk that is imposed by nuclear power has both obscured and invoked the far greater risk that is imposed by coal. Scare stories about nuclear power are a gift to the coal industry. Where they are taken seriously by politicians – as they have been in Japan – and cause a switch from nuclear to coal power, they kill people. Since the tsunami in 2011, the internet has been awash with ever more lurid claims about Fukushima. Millions have read reports claiming that children on the western seaboard of the United States are dying as a result of radiation released by the damaged plant. It doesn't seem to matter how often and effectively the stories are debunked: they keep on coming. But children in the US really are dying as a result of pollution from coal plants, and we hear almost nothing about it. Plenty of reports also propose that the water on the Pacific coast of North America is now dangerous to swimmers, and the fish there too radioactive to eat. Again, it's not true. Except in the immediate vicinity of the plant, any extra radiation to which fish in the Pacific are exposed is minute by comparison to the concentration in their tissues of polonium-210, which occurs naturally in seawater. There are, however, genuine dangers associated with another toxic contaminant found in fish: mercury. What is the primary source of mercury pollution? Ah yes, coal burning. In October, for the first time, the World Health Organisation officially listed both gaseous outdoor pollution and airborne particulates as carcinogenic to humans. Exposure levels, it notes, are rising sharply in some parts of the world. In 2010 an estimated 223,000 deaths from lung cancer were caused by air pollution. But these cancers, though wildly outstripping those correctly attributed to man-made radiation, are just a small part of the pollution problem. Far greater numbers are afflicted by other diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, heart disease, hypertension, strokes, low birth weight, pre-term delivery, pre-eclampsia and (through heavy metal exposure in the womb) impaired brain function. Three hundred micrograms of fine particulates per cubic metre of air is classed as severe pollution, the point at which children and elderly people should not leave their homes. As Greenpeace points out, in Shanghai a fortnight ago and in Harbin in October concentrations of particulates exceeded 500 micrograms. By far the greatest source of these particles is coal burning. In total, air pollution in northern China – according to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – has cut average life expectancy by five and a half years. We have exported much of our pollution – and its associated deaths – but the residue in our own countries is still severe. A study by the Clean Air Task Force suggests that coal power in the US causes 13,200 premature deaths a year. In Europe, according to the Health and Environment Alliance, the figure is 18,200. A study cited by the alliance suggests that around 200,000 children born in Europe each year have been exposed to \"critical levels\" of methylmercury in the womb. It estimates the health costs inflicted by coal burning at between €15bn (£12.5bn) and €42bn a year. Do you still reckon coal is cheap? You're picturing filthy plants in Poland and Romania, aren't you? But among the most polluting power stations in Europe, Longannet in Scotland is ranked 11th; and Drax, in England, is ranked seventh. Last week the House of Lords failed to pass an amendment that would have forced a gradual shutdown of our coal-burning power plants: they remain exempted from the emissions standards that other power stations have to meet. While nuclear power is faltering, coal is booming. Almost 1,200 new plants are being developed worldwide: many will use coal exported from the US and from Australia. The exports are now a massive source of income for these supposedly greening economies. By 2030 China is expected to be importing almost five times as much coal as it does today. The International Energy Agency estimates that the global use of coal will increase by 65% by 2035. Even before you consider climate change, this is a disaster. You don't have to be an enthusiast for atomic energy to see that it scarcely features as a health risk beside its rival. I wonder whether the nuclear panic might be a way of not seeing. Displacement is something we all do: fixing on something small to avoid engaging with something big. Coal, on which industrialism was built – and which over the past 200 years has come to seem central to our identity – is an industry much bigger and nastier and more embedded than the one we have chosen to fear. I don't believe our choice is accidental. • Twitter: @georgemonbiot.

Helena Smith reports from Athens Emerging from an impromptu meeting of senior officials with prime minister Antonis Samaras, the Greek finance minister Gilkas Hardouvelis said while a planned teleconference call with creditors had been aborted, the government was now working on fine-tuning proposals it had already put forward to the troika. “We are in constant touch with the troika,” he told reporters. High-level finance ministry officials were cited as saying that an email containing clarifications would be sent to the EU, ECB and IMF by Thursday -widely seen as the cut-off day if the deadline of completing talks by December 8 is to be met. Mission chiefs have sought further clarification on what is felt to be Athens’ overly ambitious tax raising targets and measures the government has lined up in the event of revenues falling short. Insiders said the focus of the email would be next year’s projected fiscal shortfall, at the crux of much of the disagreement between the two sides. From Brussels, Greece’s deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos conceded that the negotiations – the last before EU aid disbursements expire on December 31 – were proving to be very hard. “I want to send a very simple but clear message to Greek citizens but also our European partners. These negotiations are very difficult because they concern the future of the country and the future of our relations with our partners. They requires calm and decisiveness,” he said. The socialist leader also delivered a stark warning to lenders saying that the austerity-whipped nation could take no more. “We will arrive at a solution … as long as our partners understand – which they ought to understand – and they will understand, that Greece has exhausted its possibilities. 2015 is not 2010.” Aiming his sights at the country’s radical left main opposition Syriza party he added: “So the important thing is that in these critical days we are focused on our goal which is a national [goal]. There is no room for any petty party approach to these matters.” On that note, it’s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest Bank of England and ECB meetings. The US Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping interest rates close to zero is risky, and waiting too long to raise rates means they may have to increase more quickly when the time comes. These are comments from Philadelphia Fed president Charles Plosser made in a speech to the Charlotte Economics Club. He said inflation was heading towards the Fed’s goal and the US economy was approaching full employment. He said: Waiting too long to begin the process of raising the policy rate risks facing the possibility that the rate may have to increase rapidly when the time comes and that could prove unnecessarily disruptive. And waiting could also risk a more rapid pickup in inflation. He also called for more transparency from the Fed’s Open Market Committee: Policy can also be made more transparent and effective by specifying more completely the variables that guide policy and the general way that one can expect policymakers to react to those variables. To this end, I believe the FOMC should move forward to describe in a qualitative way its reaction function and then communicate our actions and decisions in terms of this reaction function. The full speech is here: A Longer-Term View of the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy Weak service sector surveys in the eurozone added fuel to the idea that the European Central Bank will sanction more measures to boost the economy when it meets on Thursday. Hopes that president Mario Draghi would pave the way for the purchase of sovereign bonds pushed yields lower and equities higher. In the UK, the main event was the autumn statement, with banking shares slipping lower after the chancellor blocked them from offsetting losses from the financial crisis against tax on future profits. An exception was Royal Bank of Scotland, which after a volatile time, ended the day higher. Airline shares welcomed the news that air travel taxes would be scrapped for children, while housebuilders benefited from a cut in stamp duty. However Foxtons, which specialises in expensive housing in London and the south east, fell back as buyers of higher prices properties would have to pay more tax. Overall, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 25.47 points or 0.38% lower at 6716.63 Germany’s Dax added 0.38% to 9971.79 France’s Cac edged up 0.08% to 4391.86 Italy’s FTSE MIB rose 1% to 19,978.32 Spain’s Ibex ended 1.18% better at 10,875.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 12 points or 0.07% higher. Over in Sweden it looks like the government’s budget has been defeated, a move which could lead to a new election. Here’s a report from Sweden’s The Local: Sweden’s coalition government has failed to get its budget through parliament amid a political crisis that could see the fall of the government or even fresh elections, just three months after voters last went to the polls. Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Löfven was pushing for increased spending on welfare and jobs and pledged to maintain Sweden’s liberal immigration laws in his budget. But he failed to get enough support for the financial package. This was because the nationalist Sweden Democrats - who hold the balance of power in parliament - chose to support a rival budget from Sweden’s centre-right opposition parties. Full report here: Crisis in Sweden as coalition budget fails US crude oil stocks fell by more than expected last week, showing a drop of 3.7m barrels compared to forecasts of a 1.3m barrel increase. Both Brent and the US WTI index have edged lower on the news albeit they are both still up on the day. On the ISM services sector report, James Knightley at ING Bank said the report was positive apart from the employment figure, which could mean that Friday’s non-farm payroll number disappoints. He said: The ISM non-manufacturing index has risen to 59.3 in November, up from 57.1 in October and better than the 57.5 consensus forecast. Business activity has risen to 64.4 from 60.0, which is phenomenally strong and has only been bettered a handful of times in the life time of the series back to 1997. New orders also rose and now stand at 61.4 versus the 50 break-even level while the backlog of orders is also growing, as are export orders. This is really encouraging and with the manufacturing survey also at lofty levels it suggests that the US economy will really drive the global growth story in 2015. The one disappointment is the employment component, which slipped to 56.7 from 59.6. This follows a slight dip in the ADP employment number earlier today and a pick-up in jobless claims in recent weeks. This all points to the risk of a data disappointment in Friday’s labour report. Currently, the consensus estimate is for a monthly increase of 230,000, but we expect 215,000 with probable downside risk. Nonetheless, we don’t think it is the start of a weaker trend. Weather may be a factor in the short term, but in the longer term the strength of the economy gives us confidence that the labour market will perform robustly through 2015. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has edged up around 5 points following the figures. And (almost inevitably) the ISM services sector report paints a different picture to the earlier Markit report. The Institute for Supply Management’s services index rose by more than expected in November to 59.3 from 57.1 in the previous month, and better than forecasts of 57.5. Two of the elements of the survey - employment and imports - fell compared to October but were still above the 50 level which indicates expansion. The first of two surveys of the US services sector is out, and it shows the pace of growth was at its lowest level since April. The Markit services sector purchasing managers index slipped to 56.2 in November from 57.1 in October, and marginally less than an initial estimate earlier in the month of 56.3. The forecast was for 56.5. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The slowing is still only modest, and leaves the economy growing at its approximate long-term trend rate. The survey data remain consistent with another month of non-farm payrolls rising by at least 200,000 in November. The non-farms are out on Friday, but more immediately, the ISM non-manufacturing composite index will be released imminently. Here’s an interesting Financial Times profile of Russia’s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, who is described as having one of the most difficult jobs in world finance. Hard to argue with that assessment, given that raising interest rates and floating the rouble has done little to stop the currency’s decline, hit as it is by factors outside the bank’s control, such as plunging oil prices and the western sanctions on Russia. The profile is here (£): The woman trying to tame the rouble Ahead of Friday’s US non-farm payroll numbers, the latest ADP report on private payrolls is out and looks disappointing. Here are Reuters’ snaps: 03-Dec-2014 13:15 - ADP NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT REPORT SHOWS U.S. EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY 208,000 PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS IN NOVEMBER 03-Dec-2014 13:15 - REUTERS CONSENSUS FORECAST FOR ADP PAYROLL CHANGE FOR NOV WAS FOR INCREASE OF 221,000 JOBS 03-Dec-2014 13:15 - US ADP OCTOBER PAYROLL CHANGE REVISED TO +233,000 FROM +230,000 As George Osborne speaks, here’s a comment on his earlier decision to redeem the 3.5% War Loan from Fidelity, the largest single holder of the bond. Ian Spreadbury, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity MoneyBuilder Income and Fidelity Strategic Bond funds, said: Today’s announcement is clearly good news for holders of the Fidelity MoneyBuilder Income, Fidelity Strategic Bond and Fidelity Extra Income funds. We have been happy holders of the War Loan for some period of time on the basis of two reasons. Firstly, the bond has generated attractive income compared to much lower yielding long maturity gilts. And secondly, there has also been the potential for price appreciation if the government called the instrument, as the bond has been trading below par. Obviously, we are pleased with how this has played out. It had been something of a double-edged sword for the government – if yields drop further from here they could have refinanced it at a much lower level, so they’re giving up that option. But with yields close to all time lows, I suppose it is important for them to lock in the benefit now. The biggest challenge for investors now is what to do with the proceeds. I have recycled the proceeds back into long-dated gilts, but to achieve a yield equivalent to War Loan before the announcement you have to look at single-A rated corporate bonds. Fortunately, there are opportunities to switch into bonds in that area still offering an attractive yield for the small amount of credit risk. But I caution investors not to extend risk too far down the credit spectrum in their search for yield at this point in the credit cycle. A reminder: We are live blogging the chancellor’s autumn statement here. The cost of insuring Ukraine’s debt has jumped to a five and a half year high after the government confirmed an accident at its Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Markit said Ukraine’s five year credit default swaps had opened at 1824 basis points but fell to 1775 after the news, even though the government said the incident was a minor one. Italian 10 year bond yields have fallen below 2% for the first time, with the market expecting the European Central Bank to hint at more stimulus measures and bond buying at its meeting on Thursday. The weak eurozone service sector data earlier has also helped to send most bond yields lower. Some UK corporate news and Richard Glynn, the embattled chief executive of Ladbrokes, is to step down from the bookmaker after five years in charge. My colleague Simon Goodley reports: The move, which had long been predicted in the City, came as Ladbrokes tried to claim that Glynn had completed a five-year turnaround of the business, despite the company’s shares being 24% lower than when he started in the job. During that time, shares in rival William Hill have risen by 60%. In a statement Ladbrokes admitted that Glynn’s “recovery programme has taken longer to deliver than initially anticipated” but insisted that it believes that the changes made are now “deeply embedded in the organisation and that increasing attention should now be focused on delivering sustainable growth from a much stronger operational and digital platform”. Chairman Peter Erskine, who personally picked Glynn, added: “I would like to thank Richard for his leadership of the company and his considerable achievements in delivering a new digital future for Ladbrokes. He has devoted enormous energy and dedication to securing the transformation of the company and the benefits of that work are beginning to be seen. I am pleased that he will both see through the final steps of the implementation plan and be on hand to facilitate an orderly succession process. Ladbrokes has been transformed and is a far stronger company as a result of his work”. Full story here: Ladbrokes chief to step down after five-year term More from Reuters on the Ukrainian power plant situation: Ukraine’s Energy Minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn said on Wednesday an accident at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southeast Ukraine posed no danger and that the plant would return to running as normal on December 5. “There is no threat ... there are no problems with the reactors,” Demchyshyn said at briefing, saying the accident affected the power output system and “in no way” was linked to power production itself. In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it had no immediate comment on the report. Under an international convention, adopted after the 1986 Chernobyl accident in what was then Soviet Ukraine, a country should notify the IAEA of any nuclear accident that can impact other countries. Over in Greece, and the troika of international lenders want more information on proposed pension reforms, newspaper Kathimerini is reporting: Greece’s international lenders have asked for more information on pension reform to plug a potential budget gap next year, a government official said on Wednesday, as the two sides continue to haggle in a bailout review. Athens has offered to raise value-added tax on hotels and implement pension reform to satisfy European Union/International Monetary Fund lenders’ concerns of a potential budget shortfall next year. The aim is to get a deal by a December 8 deadline that would, in turn, allow Greece to exit its bailout program by the end of the year. Government spokeswoman Sofia Voultepsi confirmed that Greece received a response from lenders early on Wednesday. She did not give further details and it was not immediately clear whether the two sides were closer to reaching a deal. A labor ministry official said the lenders had sought more information on pension reform proposed by the government. The lenders did not specify any date for returning to Athens to complete the review, Adonis Georgiadis, an official from Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s conservative party told Greek television. Samaras has staked his government’s political survival on exiting the deeply reviled EU/IMF bailout by the end of the year, but his plans have been held up by deadlocked talks on the review. The lenders have demanded additional measures to make up for an expected budget shortfall next year but Samaras on Tuesday said the government refused to hike taxes and cut incomes, arguing it would hurt a nascent economic recovery. Here’s Reuters first take on the Ukraine situation: Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said on Wednesday an accident had occurred at the Zaporizhye nuclear power plant (NPP) in south-east Ukraine and called on the energy minister to hold a news conference. “I know that an accident has occurred at the Zaporizhye NPP,” Yatseniuk said, asking new energy minister Volodymyr Demchyshyn to make clear when the problem would be resolved and what steps would be taken to restore normal power supply across Ukraine. News agency Interfax Ukraine said the problem had occurred at bloc No 3 - a 1,000-megawatt reactor - and the resulting lack of output had worsened the power crisis in the country. Interfax added that the bloc was expected to come back on stream on Dec. 5. The Ukraine energy minister seems to be playing down the problems at one of its nuclear plants: Reports are coming in of a possible accident at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine, as revealed by the country’s prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk: Elsewhere, Russia’s central bank is intervening in the currency market again to defend the rouble, according to Reuters. It reports: “Without doubt, the central bank is selling (foreign currency). The whole question is what volumes it is limiting itself too,” said a trader at a large Western bank in Moscow. Earlier on Wednesday the central bank said it had made $700m in market interventions on Monday, its first interventions since November 10, the day before it floated the rouble. On Tuesday the economy ministry warned the country could sink into recession next year, weighed down by falling oil prices and sanctions by the west. Back to the news that the Treasury will pay off the first world war bond. Toby Nangle at Threadneedle, which is one of the two biggest holders of the debt, has been lobbying the Debt Management Office to pay it off. Reacting to the news, he said: We are really pleased to hear Chancellor Osborne announcing today that the War Loan is being refinanced. We estimate that refinancing this bond will deliver around £15m of interest savings per annum, comparable to a debt reduction of over £500m. We engaged with officials at the UK Debt Management Office outlining our assessment of the benefits of calling of the War Loan. We are delighted that on reflection they arrived at the same conclusion. The Treasury’s move to refinance government debt at lower yields in a market friendly manner echoes similar moves conducted by previous chancellors, notably George Goschen in 1888, albeit on a smaller scale. More data from Europe, and eurozone retail sales returned to growth in October but fell short of expectations. After a weak third quarter, sales rose 0.4% month on month for a 1.4% year on year gain. This follows a fall of 1.2% month on month in September but was below forecasts of 0.6% growth. Sales of non-food products and fuel at petrol stations were the biggest contributors to the rise, with sales of food, drink and tobacco flat in the month, according to Eurostat. Speaking of the autumn statement, my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Graeme Wearden are live blogging the chancellor’s speech and all the reaction here: Autumn statement 2014: George Osborne to miss deficit targets - live More comment on the UK services figures. James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK service sector purchasing managers’ index offers more encouragement on fourth quarter GDP growth. The headline index has risen to 58.6 from 56.2 and with the manufacturing index also having risen on Monday (while the construction index fell yesterday) it leaves the composite PMI at 57.6 versus 55.8 previously – the consensus forecast was for a reading of 56.2. In terms of the services survey, there were strong gains in new orders, which points to decent output growth in the first quarter of 2015, while the employment index rose further. Inflation pressures remain very subdued though, suggesting little imminent pressure for Bank of England policy action. [Reminder: both the Bank of England and ECB are meeting on Thursday]. Indeed, there is a growing prospect of a sub-1% inflation reading in January given the plunge in motor fuel costs and the ongoing supermarket price-war. The survey compiler suggests that these figures are roughly consistent with GDP growth of 0.6% quarter on quarter. We are more optimistic in terms of fourth quarter GDP, pencilling 0.8% quarter of quarter, on the basis of a strengthening household sector and a rebound in investment. Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX, said: Services PMI data this morning solidly beat expectations with a reading of 58.6, when a reading of 56.6 was previously forecast. The pound has rallied slightly against the dollar and strongly against the euro this morning as eurozone PMI data earlier today was disappointing and triggered euro weakness across the board. This latest PMI reading bodes well for sterling, but the broader market reaction seems a bit more muted than it would usually be, as market participants are likely to be waiting for the autumn statement this afternoon before making their final decisions. I’m now handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Here is some instant reaction to the UK services numbers. Alan Clark at Scotia Bank said: The CIPS Services survey was much higher than expected last month, rebounding to 58.6 from 56.2 - regaining pretty much all of the ground that it lost the prior month. Combined with the manufacturing index that gives a composite reading of 57.0 - consistent with ongoing above trend GDP. That is hardly a reading that suggests rate hikes would be a killer blow to the economy. While I accept that headline inflation is slowing due to energy and food prices, these have the same impact as a tax cut which is good for growth and supportive for core inflation. I’m not turning all hawkish on you, but my point is that data like these suggest to me that waiting at least another year before we dare risk raising interest rates is a little excessive. Maybe we are looking at this the wrong way and the Maradona Theory is working to the max. More specifically, earlier in the year the market fully priced 25bp per quarter of rate hikes through to end 2015. That probably dampened sentiment. Right now the market is pricing virtually no tightening until late next year, and sentiment is rebounding. Surely there must be some middle ground? (for what its worth we are still calling mid-2015 for the first hike). Markit said: Supporting the latest increase in activity was another rise in new business volumes. Panellists commented that demand was high, and they had been able to secure contracts from both new and existing clients. Advertising and marketing drives provided further support to sales efforts, and overall new business growth strengthened since October with over 28% of panellists recording a rise in new work. UK’s services sector is stonking ahead: Growth was stronger than expected last month. The PMI headline index climbed to 58.6 from 56.2 in October, pointing “to a marked and accelerated rate of expansion that was well above the survey’s historical average,” survey compiler Markit said. The City had expected a slight improvement to 56.5. Italian services firms recorded a rise in business activity for the second month running in November, although a slight fall in new business and shrinking backlogs of work painted a gloomier picture of the short-term outlook, survey compiler Markit said. The headline business activity index rose to 51.8 from October’s 50.8. For the eurozone as a whole, Markit’s composite PMI, based on surveys of thousands of manufacturing and services companies across the currency bloc, slid to 51.1 in November from October’s 52.1, despite heavy price cutting by businesses. Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist, said: The region is on course to see a mere 0.1% GDP growth in the final quarter of the year, with a strong likelihood of the near-stagnation turning to renewed contraction in the new year unless demand shows signs of reviving. In France, business activity across manufacturing and services shrank at the fastest rate in nine months in November, dragged down by weak services. Markit’s composite PMI dropped to 47.9 from October’s 48.2, below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. In the services sector alone, the reading was 47.9. Markit economist Jack Kennedy said: The latest PMI data show a deepening downturn in the French service sector during November. With manufacturing also continuing to struggle, the private sector looks set to act as a drag on GDP during the fourth quarter. Germany’s private sector grew at the slowest pace in 17 months in November, a survey showed. Markit’s final composite PMI, which covers the manufacturing and service sectors, dropped to 51.7 from 53.9 in October. The services index alone fell to 52.1, a 16-month low. Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Composite PMI data suggest the German economy is likely to face another quarter of only marginal growth at best, with fears of a renewed downturn intensifying. In financial markets, the rouble opened flat but then resumed its slide despite data confirming that the Russian central bank stepped in to defend the currency on Monday. It is down 1.2% at 54.47 to the dollar, and nearly 1% lower at 67.25 against the euro. The FTSE 100 index in London is slightly down ahead of the chancellor’s autumn statement: it has slipped more than 7 points or 0.1% at 6734.49. Germany’s Dax is 17 points ahead at 9951.27, a 0.2% gain, while France’s CAC has edged down nearly 4 points, or 0.08%, to 4384.57. Ireland’s services PMI edged up to 61.6 last month from 61.5 in October, signalling strong expansion. The Markit PMI data for Spain suggests that growth in its service industries lost momentum as both activity and new business grew at much weaker rates than seen in October. The headline business activity index dropped to 52.7 in November from 55.9 in October, the lowest reading for a year. Enough of the past. The main event on the economic calendar today is the PMI services data for the eurozone (released between now and 9am GMT) and the UK (9.30am GMT). We’ve already had data for Japan, the world’s third-largest economy: its services sector returned to growth in November. Markit’s service sector purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 50.6 from 48.7 in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Down under, the Australian economy expanded just 0.3% in the three months to September, compared with expectations of 0.7% growth. The Australian dollar fell below 84 US cents for the first time since 2010, which Joe Hockey, the country’s treasurer, said was very welcome. You can read our story here. Returning to the war debt, the first bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: “If you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds ... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.” Last night, the Bank of England and the Treasury announced a one-year extension to the Funding for Lending scheme, to support bank lending to small and medium-sized businesses next year – “even in the event of stress in bank funding markets”. They said the scheme, which provides cheap funding to banks to support business lending, has contributed to a “substantial fall in bank funding costs” since its launch in mid-2012. Fidelity and Threadneedle Asset Management are the biggest holders of the 3.5% bond, called War Loan. No doubt they will be delighted with today’s announcement. Toby Nangle, a fund manager at Threadneedle, has been lobbying the Debt Management Office to pay off the first world war bond. You can read the Treasury’s announcement in full here. These gilts include some debt originally issued in the era of the South Sea bubble in the 18th century, as well as to fund he Bank of England’s nationalisation. The nation has paid some £5.5bn in interest on 5% War Loan 1929-47 and 3½% War Loan since 1917. 3½% War Loan is the most widely held of any UK government bond, with more than 120,000 holders. 97,000 of these investors hold less than £1,000 nominal, and almost 38,000 holders own less than £100. The news comes just over a month after the government said it would pay off £218m from a 4% consolidated loan next February, as part of a redemption of bonds stretching as far back as the 18th century. They also relate to the South Sea Bubble crisis of 1720, the Napoleonic and Crimean wars and the Irish potato famine. This was the first planned repayment of an undated gilt of this kind for 67 years. The Treasury said today’s announcement kicks off a strategy to remove all six of the other remaining undated gilts in the government’s portfolio, “when we deem it value for money to do so”. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. George Osborne has kicked off the autumn statement (which he will present in the House of Commons at 12.30pm) several hours early by announcing that the Treasury will repay the nation’s entire first world war debt. The Treasury will redeem the outstanding £1.9 billion of debt from 3½% War Loan on 9 March 2015. This bond was issued in 1932 by the then chancellor Neville Chamberlain to reduce the costs of servicing the national debt. The bond was issued in exchange for 5% War Loan 1929 to 1947, which had been issued in 1917 as part of the government’s efforts to raise money to pay for the first world war. The Treasury said it would refinance the war debt with new bonds, taking advantage of low interest rates. Osborne said: This is a moment for Britain to be proud of. We can, at last, pay off the debts Britain incurred to fight the First World War. It is a sign of our fiscal credibility and it’s a good deal for this generation of taxpayers. It’s also another fitting way to remember that extraordinary sacrifice of the past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2014/jul/19/this-weeks-new-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-19T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes, Grand Central, Jealousy: this week’s new films","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/19/this-weeks-new-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/19/this-weeks-new-films","fields":{"headline":"Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes, Grand Central, Jealousy: this week’s new films","bodyText":"Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes (12A) (Matt Reeves, 2014, US) Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell. 130 mins One branch higher up the evolutionary tree than its summer rivals, this sequel combines spectacular, sophisticated visuals with a story that takes a post-apocalyptic face-off with genetically enhanced primates as seriously as it possibly could.

Both countries have nine of the so-called “dirty 30” and the campaigners say coal burning is increasing due to the relatively low price of the fuel compared to gas. “Germany and the UK are the self-declared climate champions of the EU,” says the new report. “However, Germany uses more coal to generate electricity than any other EU country, while the UK comes third in absolute coal consumption for power after Poland.” The report argues current EU policy on climate, energy and air pollution in the power sector is not strong enough to achieve the switch from coal to renewable energy and energy efficiency. Poland’s Belchatow plant came top of the list, with annual CO2 emissions of 37m tonnes in 2013. The UK’s largest coal plant, Drax, was sixth, with four German plants occupying second to fifth place. Germany’s increase in coal burning has been criticised by supporters of nuclear energy because Germany opted to phase out all nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. The report shows that the electricity generation lost from the closed nuclear plants (43 TWh from 2010-2013) was more than compensated for by the increase in renewable electricity (47 TWh 2010-2103). The increase in the proportion of electricity generated from coal (3.6 percentage points between 2010 and 2013) was the same as the reduction of electricity from gas burning. Germany also exported a record amount of electricity in 2013 (33 TWh). The total emissions from the EU energy sector fell modestly in 2013 but the campaigners say the rising use of cheap coal puts the EU in danger of not meeting future climate targets. The price of pollution permits in the EU’s emission trading scheme remains far below the level which would make it more economic to use gas, which produces about half as much carbon emissions. According the International Energy Agency, the share of coal in EU electricity generation must be below 4% by 2035 but is currently about 25%. The report also highlights the negative health impacts of coal burning, stating that air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulates and mercury is estimated to cause 1,600 deaths a year in the UK. “Our political leaders are justifiably proud of their record on supporting tackling climate change on the global stage,” said Jenny Banks at WWF-UK, one of the groups that produced the report. “But they must make sure they’re not saying one thing and doing another. Coal is by far the most polluting source of electricity. Tackling climate change means making sure that emissions from coal power are phased out over the next decade.” “Each of the largest coal power stations in Europe is responsible for hundreds of millions of external health costs,” said Julia Huscher, at the Health and Environment Alliance, another group behind the report.”The phase-out of coal in Europe will be a win-win, because it will help to achieve clean air for more people, and avoid further health damage from climate change.” The report said rising emissions from coal plants were due to increasing use of existing facilities, rather than new ones opening. It warned policymakers against allowing extensions to the lifetimes of coal plants, most of which were built in the 1960s and 1970s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/aug/29/putin-ukraine-forces-nazis-arctic","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-29T11:51:29Z","webTitle":"Putin likens Ukraine's forces to Nazis and threatens standoff in the Arctic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/putin-ukraine-forces-nazis-arctic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/aug/29/putin-ukraine-forces-nazis-arctic","fields":{"headline":"Putin likens Ukraine's forces to Nazis and threatens standoff in the Arctic","bodyText":"The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has hit back at accusations that he has effectively invaded Ukraine, accusing Kiev's forces of behaving like Nazis in the conflict in the east and ominously threatening to take his standoff with the west into the disputed Arctic. Hours after Barack Obama accused Russia of sending troops into Ukraine and fuelling an escalation in the battle, and as the government in Kiev indicated that it wanted to join Nato, Putin retorted that the Ukrainian army was the real villain, targeting residential areas of towns and cities as German troops had done in the former Soviet Union. He added that Russians and Ukrainians \"are practically one people\", reprising a theme of an earlier statement in which he referred to the disputed areas of south-eastern Ukraine as Novorossiya, harking back to tsarist times, when the area was ruled from Moscow. He answered questions from young supporters, some waving banners bearing his face, at a pro-Kremlin youth camp on the shores of a lake. He looked relaxed but his tone grew intense as he spoke of Russia's military might, reminding the crowd that Russia was a strong nuclear power. \"Russia's partners … should understand it's best not to mess with us,\" he said. And he made a pointed reference to the Arctic, which, with its bounteous energy reserves and thawing waterways, is emerging as a potential new point of conflict between Russia and its western rivals. \"Our interests are concentrated in the Arctic. And of course we should pay more attention to issues of development of the Arctic and the strengthening of our position,\" he said. Russia's latest alleged incursions, in which it stands accused of sending as many as 1,000 soldiers together with military hardware across the border to bolster the flagging separatist insurrection, has prompted a flurry of emergency meetings. Nato ambassadors emerged on Friday morning to accuse Russia of a \"blatant violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty. \"Despite Moscow's hollow denials, it is now clear that Russian troops and equipment have illegally crossed the border into eastern and south-eastern Ukraine,\" its secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said. A minor incident later blew up in central Europe when a plane carrying the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, was apparently denied permission to travel through Polish airspace. The conflict escalated this week when Ukraine accused Russia of helping separatists open up a second front in the far south-east, near the coastal city of Mariupol. Rebels overran the nearby town of Novoazovsk, close to the Russian border, and local Ukrainian defence units said the men involved had crossed from Russia and appeared to include regular Russian troops. The ultimate goal of the Russian movements remain unclear; some believe a full-on advance towards Mariupol could be in the offing, while others suggest the increased activity is aimed at changing the facts on the ground and ensuring that a long-term \"frozen conflict\" situation emerges in the region, such that Kiev can never win back full control. At Mariupol airport, Captain Ruslan Muzychuk said forces were \"preparing to defend the city\" from a potential attack, stating it was \"one of the most important places for Ukraine to control\". He said he believed the forces that had seized Novoazovsk included regular Russian soldiers. Armoured vehicles, pick-up trucks and civilian cars filled with fighters poured in and out, in a sign of the improvised nature of much of the Ukrainian military effort. At a sport school in Mariupol that has been turned into a base for the Azov battalion, a volunteer unit that has drawn criticism for its far-right links but is fighting with the Ukrainian army, one of the commanders said he believed his men were now at war with the Russian army. \"From the way they look it is clear they are different to the separatist fighters,\" said the commander, who gave his nom de guerre, Kirt. He said his battalion were having to fight without heavy weaponry or armoured vehicles. They have been promised reinforcements and new equipment repeatedly by Kiev, he said, but the government does not deliver."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dems-vote-nuclear-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T19:10:25Z","webTitle":"Lib Dems' green boast under threat as party votes for nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dems-vote-nuclear-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/15/lib-dems-vote-nuclear-conference","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dems' green boast under threat as party votes for nuclear","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrats have embraced nuclear power for the first time in their 25-year history on the grounds that it will help Britain tackle climate change. In a historic reversal of policy, hundreds of members on Sunday voted in favour of accepting a \"limited\" role for atomic power plants in a safe and affordable way. Grassroots Liberal Democrats appeared to be in a pragmatic mood as they also backed the leadership over the controversial issues of tuition fees and fracking on the second day of the party's Glasgow conference. In a boost for Nick Clegg, they accepted the current system of university funding as \"the best deal for students and taxpayers\", although an amendment was passed agreeing to adapt it if necessary at a later date. On shale gas, the party agreed to accept fracking in \"controlled\" circumstances, with an amendment that would ensure it takes place under stricter regulation. The acceptance of nuclear power, however, was the most significant U-turn. The party backed atomic plants following an impassioned speech by Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, and several hours of tense debate about the role of nuclear power in green politics. Davey argued it would be reckless to reject such a large low-carbon source of energy, which would help wean Britain off fossil fuels. Green groups reacted with fury to the change, arguing the party had moved further towards Tory positions. Davey admitted making the case against nuclear power from the same platform in 2006 but said he had listened to arguments about its benefits since then. \"I've changed my mind because of climate change,\" he said. It would be unimaginably hard to create a zero-carbon Britain without getting electricity from nuclear, he said. He also raised the prospect that nuclear energy will be near-essential if scientists fail in their efforts to cut carbon emissions from fossil fuels with new \"capture and storage\" technology. \"When I have listened to pro-nuclear Liberal Democrats over the years, there is one argument I have found increasingly difficult to answer and that is the climate change argument,\" he told members. \"Climate change poses a real and massive danger to our planet. Not keeping a genuinely low source of electricity as an option is reckless when we don't know the future. \"We are going to need vast amounts of low-carbon electricity to tackle climate change. Why? Because if our carbon capture and storage plans don't work, we may have to replace all fossil fuels for electricity generation. That is about 60% of all generation. If we do that without nuclear, you will need to replace about 85% of electricity generation. That's huge.\" Liberal Democrats have been against nuclear power since the party was formed in the late 1980s. Back then, under the leadership of Lord Ashdown, the party said nuclear power was incompatible with green politics, arguing there was no safe method of disposing of nuclear waste. An anti-nuclear stance has helped the Liberal Democrats develop an image as the most environmentally aware of the main parties, with the 2010 manifesto rejecting a new generation of plants, mostly because of the cost. However, Chris Huhne, the first Lib Dem energy secretary, began the process of accepting nuclear by saying the party could accept it as long as there would be no taxpayer subsidy. Since Davey took over the reins, he has been negotiating with EDF, the French nuclear giant, over the extra amount it can charge people for electricity to cover the cost of building the first plants. Despite the fact nuclear power has been tacitly accepted by the leadership, senior Liberal Democrat sources feared they would lose the vote. In the end, 230 people were in favour of allowing more nuclear power, compared with 183 against the idea of any new generation of plants. It raises the prospect that tentative support for nuclear power may be contained in the 2015 manifesto. The motion said it would \"accept in future nuclear power stations could play a limited role in electricity supply, provided concerns about safety, disposal of radioactive waste and cost are adequately addressed\". There were strong feelings on both sides which split former political allies. Joel Kenrick, an adviser to Huhne when he was energy secretary, argued in favour of allowing nuclear power to tackle climate change. But Huhne's other former adviser, Duncan Brack, said that the party's idea of allowing limited nuclear power without subsidy was a chimera and a fantasy. Fiona Hall, a Liberal Democrat MEP, also argued the motion is based on a false premise because the coalition's plans to make voters pay for nuclear power through their energy bills is tantamount to a subsidy. \"If it looks like a subsidy and smells like a subsidy, it is a subsidy,\" she said. Others argued that abandoning the party's long-held opposition to nuclear power would risk alienating core voters, who were first attracted to the party because of that environmental issue. However, several prominent MPs stood up to back the leadership, including Julian Huppert, a scientist, who said nuclear \"is not perfect, but nothing is\". Craig Bennett, policy director at Friends of the Earth, said: \"The change punches a huge hole in the Liberal Democrats' fast-sinking green credibility.\" \"Nuclear power comes with massive costs attached,\" he said. \"Ed Davey is deluded if he thinks new reactors can go ahead without public subsidy – building them will result in the Liberal Democrats, yet again, breaking their promises.\" Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, added: \"The vote shows how far the Liberal Democrats have slid from their previously principled position on energy and climate.\" He added: \"The party now seems prepared to thrust the issues of nuclear waste and funding on to future generations, rather than take on vested interests and put us on the road to dealing with the climate crisis in a clean, safe way.\" Despite accepting the party's stance on nuclear, gas and tuition fees, Liberal Democrat members unexpectedly revolted over the issue of blocking online pornography. They rejected a motion, proposed by Baroness Floella Benjamin, the former children's television presenter, suggesting all computers should filter out pornography unless a user specifically opts to receive it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/dec/03/uk-chinese-investment-hs2-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-03T09:47:31Z","webTitle":"UK would welcome Chinese investment in HS2, says David Cameron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/uk-chinese-investment-hs2-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/dec/03/uk-chinese-investment-hs2-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"UK would welcome Chinese investment in HS2, says David Cameron","bodyText":"David Cameron has told the Chinese leadership that he would welcome investment by Beijing in Britain's high-speed rail network. In a question-and-answer sessions at Jiao Tong university in Shanghai, the prime minister said he had told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the premier, Li Keqiang, that Britain had much to learn from the success of China's high-speed rail lines. But Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary and father of the HS2 project, added a note of caution as he said that a former Chinese minister who offered to invest in 2009 is now in jail over the fatal crash near Wenzhou in 2011. \"Chinese also offered to build HS2 when I visited in 2009,\" Adonis tweeted. \"The minister I met now under suspended death sentence after major HS rail crash.\" Adonis tweeted as Cameron said he would welcome Chinese investment in HS2. The prime minister told students in Shanghai: \"We think we have a lot to learn from China because of the success of your high-speed rail. I said to your president and prime minister yesterday that just as we welcome Chinese investment into nuclear power, into other infrastructure so there will be very open competition to provide the infrastructure for our network. We will welcome Chinese investment into that.\" Cameron's remarks came after Li told Cameron in Beijing on Monday that China would like to invest in the HS2 project that will link London and Birmingham by 2026 with a further Y-shaped links Manchester and the north-east by 2032. Speaking in the Great Hall of the People, the Chinese premier said: \"The two sides have agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress in the co-operation between our enterprises on nuclear power and high-speed rail. The Chinese side is willing to not only participate in but also purchase equities and stocks in UK power projects. Just like the high-speed train, we need to grow this relationship at a higher speed.\" Cameron told the students in Shanghai that building high-speed rail in Britain is a more complex process. He said: \"The problem in a small country like the UK is that infrastructure decisions are very controversial because we are a small and relatively crowded island so the use of space for infrastructure is always controversial, whether we are trying to build airports, whether we are trying to build railway lines or whether we are trying to build new roads. My government has taken a very clear view that the countries that will succeed in the future are the countries with the most modern infrastructure.\" George Osborne announced during his visit to China in October that Beijing would invest in the next generation of civil nuclear power plants in Britain. In his Q&amp;A with students, Cameron joked that prime minister's questions in the Commons was like a \"form of torture\" because he has no idea of the questions that will raised. \"It is easily the worst half an hour of the prime minister's week because you can be asked about any subject under the sun,\" he said. But the prime minister added: \"There are two good things about this form of torture that we have in the UK. First of all it puts the prime minister on their mettle. It puts them a little bit to the test because it is very important to be able to demonstrate that you can answer about health or housing or foreign policy or the economy. The public can see if you're not doing well or they can see if you're doing OK. \"The second thing that is a benefit is that it means on Wednesday – and in the runup to Wednesday – I have to check my government; I have to check every single part of my government to see what is going on … It makes the government accountable. It means that the whole of the mass of the government has to account through that one person, the prime minister. So this torture has its purpose.\" The prime minister also joked that his old Oxford politics tutor Vernon Bogdanor still criticises him in emails. \"Even though I left 25 years ago he still sends me emails criticising my work, which is very good of him. He sometimes says I have done something well. But he often emails the other way.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"gnmeducationcentre/women-miners-strike-1984-85-jean-stead-teaching-resource-gnm-archive","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-foundation","sectionName":"Guardian Foundation","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-02T14:39:00Z","webTitle":"Jean Stead and the women of the miners' strike","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/women-miners-strike-1984-85-jean-stead-teaching-resource-gnm-archive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/gnmeducationcentre/women-miners-strike-1984-85-jean-stead-teaching-resource-gnm-archive","fields":{"headline":"Jean Stead and the women of the miners' strike","bodyText":"Picture: Armthorpe Wives support group Jean Stead, previously news editor for the Guardian, was Scottish correspondent at the time of the miners' strike of 1984-85. She reported on the strikes in Scotland (a village in Stirlingshire claimed to have started the national strike when the Polmaise pit was closed in January 1984) and clearly felt strongly about the situation faced by both men and women in the mining communities across the country. One item in the Jean Stead collection is a draft of a letter to Alastair Hetherington, then chairman of the Scott Trust, in which Stead explains her disappointment at the way the strike had been reported in the national press, and describes an incident she witnessed at a demonstration: \"Demonstrators were dragged out of the crowd by the police, including a mother whose child was knocked out of her arms and tramped on by policemen (it was not seriously hurt) and she was dragged away half naked. You have to be there to see these things. I was there.\" Stead spoke to women from mining communities across Britain about their involvement in the strike. She wrote a book, Never the Same Again: Women and the Miners' Strike, which was published in 1987 and is held in the historical reference library in the Archive. The book analyses the part the women played in the strikes, as well as how the strike transformed the lives of those women. She dedicated the book \"To women and men of Polmaise Colliery\". Picture: Polmaise miners' wives relief organisation Women formed support groups as soon as the national strike began on 9 March 1984. One of the largest and most influential of these groups was the Barnsley Women Against Pit Closures. They organised an all-women rally and march through Barnsley on 12 May 1984, and invited women's support groups from all over the country to join them. The response was huge, and at least 10,000 women attended the rally. Stead writes in Never the Same Again: \"It was the Barnsley march that started things off. It was after this that the women started contacting groups from outside their own areas, making plans, organising and getting together on a national basis […] It was a turning point, not only in the strike, but in the working class feminist movement as a whole.\" After the success in Barnsley, another national women's rally was organised to take place in London on 11 August 1984. 15,000 women attended. Shortly before the rally, a unified national women's support group was founded: Women Against Pit Closures (WAPC). Picture: Women Against Pit Closures rally in London The aims of the WAPC were not just to secure the future of the mines and the jobs of their husbands and sons, but as Stead explains, included \"The promotion and development of education for working class women and campaigns on all issues which affect mining communities, particularly peace, jobs, health and education, and the issues of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.\" On the issue of nuclear power, the women's groups found allies in the women at the protest camps at Greenham Common. The women's page in the Guardian on 28 May 1984 features an interview with members of the Barnsley WAPC, including both Anne Scargill (then wife of Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers) and Betty Heathfield, wife of NUM general secretary Peter Heathfield and leading figure in the women's support groups. The piece describes how the strike had transformed how working class women were perceived by the rest of the country: \"The comfy, media image of working class wives whose husbands are on strike has been one of them conservatively egging them back to work, stabbing them in the back. One by-product of the miners' women's action is the creation of a powerful new image, distinctive, feminist, and very much part of the 80s.\" Picture: Miners' wives counting money in response to appeal Women involved in the strikes were discovering they were capable of things they had never before considered, like public speaking and large scale organisation, and it was transforming their lives for good. In Stead's book, Kay Bowen, wife of the delegate at the Blaenent colliery, Wales says: \"I'd thought I'd never be able to give orders or ask people to do things. But I've found that I like leadership and being in charge. I've changed, like all the other women, and I'll never be able to go back to how I was before.\" They were also gaining a new respect from the men in their communities, though this was sometimes grudging; Susan Petney from Blidworth in Nottinghamshire says in Stead's book: \"We are sort of re-educating them slowly. They are not liking it a lot [...] But slowly they are coming round to it. They don't call us 'ladies' any more. They call us women. That's a start.\" Barbara Williams, another influential figure in the women's groups, and the leader of the Rhondda women at Maerdy in Wales, said: \"We have shaken men. Men thought we were content with our lot. Now they realise that a woman is not just a wife in the house; there's something else in the house.\" The strike ended on 5 March 1985, nearly a year after it began. The women's page from 5 June 1985 focuses on how the miners' wives were reacting to the end of the strike. One of the stories looks at how marriages had been adversely affected, and how women were being forced back into their traditional roles in the home by the demands of their husbands' shifts in the mines. But the other story is far more positive: a miner's wife who described herself as \"A housewife, plain and simple […] totally non-political\" before the strike, tells of how she began speaking on behalf of the miners during the strike, and was subsequently invited by Anne Scargill to Europe to speak to trade unions and mining towns as well as the European Parliament in Strasbourg. \"The dispute brought working people from all round Britain and abroad closer together\" she says. \"That's how we survived. We've stood together and shown what we are capable of.\" Picture: Women Against Pit Closures, Sheffield The Jean Stead collection and photographs from the miners' strike can be consulted in the GNM Archive reading room by appointment.

The revelation is further evidence of how Westminster has collaborated with the industry to try and protect nuclear power from bad news, first exposed by the Guardian in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident in Japan last year. The German utilities, E.ON and RWE, announced on 29 March that they were abandoning plans to build two nuclear power stations at Oldbury in Gloucestershire and Wylfa in Anglesey. The decision was blamed on the German government's retreat from nuclear power after Fukushima and doubts about financing. Two days before the announcement, Hergen Haye, head of new nuclear at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), wrote to E.ON and RWE. He asked if he could be informed when the companies had told Carwyn Jones, Labour's first minister for Wales, of their decision. Haye told the companies that this was \"in order for us to share our press lines to co-ordinate a united message\". The companies' proposed press statements looked \"broadly fine\", he said, but promised to forward \"any detailed comments\". He asked about \"engagement plans and timing\" for telling local authorities. \"Also we have been thinking about some difficult/defensive line issues and would be grateful for sight of what you may say,\" he said. He wanted to know how the companies would respond to journalists questioning whether the UK government could have done something differently to prevent the pull out. \"Do you think it is possible for new nuclear to be built in the UK?\" Haye asked. E.ON responded the next morning by saying it believed that ministers were \"putting in place a framework which will make it possible for new nuclear\". Its withdrawal was \"not a reflection on the work done by the UK government\". At the same time, RWE gave details of when it was informing Jones, as well as Labour's shadow energy minister, Tom Greatrex, the commercial secretary to the Treasury, Lord Sassoon, and a raft of other politicians and local stakeholders. \"We think it is possible for new nuclear to be built in the UK,\" RWE said. \"As you can see from the press release, we are not making any comment on the UK policy position.\" The emails, large portions of which have been censored, were released by Decc in response to a request under freedom of information legislation. One from RWE is marked \"strictly private and confidential\". The environmental group Greenpeace accused ministers of trying to mislead the public. \"The government has been colluding with the nuclear industry to try to media manage the collapse of their hopes,\" said nuclear campaigner, Richard George. \"In reality the cost of new nuclear power has doubled in recent years and continues to rise. Instead of trying to pull the wool over the public's eyes, the government should accept their nuclear dream is over and back renewable energy.\" Decc insisted that it worked with potential nuclear investors in exactly the same way as it worked with other energy investors, including those in the renewable industry. \"It was important to understand why the consortium decided not to take forward their interest in UK nuclear new build,\" said a Decc spokesman. \"As they made clear, their decision was based on pressures elsewhere in their businesses and not any doubts about the role of nuclear in the UK's energy future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T17:15:03Z","webTitle":"Sir Terry Pratchett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/mar/12/terry-pratchett","fields":{"headline":"Sir Terry Pratchett obituary","bodyText":"BEING DEAD IS NOT COMPULSORY. NOT IF YOU DON’T WANT TO. These are the words of Death, one of Terry Pratchett’s ingenious comic creations in his Discworld novels. Death has a booming, unamused voice (always in capitals, never in quotation marks), and is the permanent straight man in the comic chaos around him. He goes about his morbid business on a horse called Binky, whose hooves throw up sparks on every street cobble. Death is a skeleton, with eyes like two tiny blue stars set deep within the sockets. He wears a black cloak, carries a scythe and, at the end of a day’s work, loves to murder a curry. At the point of contact with his latest client, he usually spends a few moments having a courteous word or two with the recently deceased, until they fade away. Now Death has gained a most illustrious client, for Pratchett himself has died, aged 66, after suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The exchange is no doubt unamused but courteous on one side, amusing but rueful on the other, but of fervent interest to both parties. It’s a conversation that millions of Pratchett fans would ache to overhear. Would Death dare to speak in capitals to Sir Terry Pratchett? Pratchett was, and will remain, one of the most popular British authors of all time. In the modern age, only the career of JK Rowling, creator of Harry Potter, is comparable. The facts of Pratchett’s success are impressive: the sheer number of books he has sold (some 80m copies worldwide), and the number of reprints, translations, dramatisations on television and stage, audio versions and spin-offs, plus awards and honorary doctorates galore. Then there’s an inestimable amount of Discworld spinoffery: chess pieces, wizardly hats, cloaks and T-shirts, leathern bags, pottery figurines, fantastic artwork, magic clobber of every kind including dribbly candles – all made by and sold to fans. His signings at bookshops were legendary: a queue stretching down the street was de rigueur, and although Pratchett worked quickly at the signatures, he was unfailingly friendly to everyone who turned up. He was open to readers: he answered emails (or some of them, because the volume of incoming messages was spectacular) and he went to Discworld conventions (almost all of them). He was a nice man, unpretentious and with a wry manner. Pratchett was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, son of David and Eileen. He described himself as an omnivorous reader of books from the local library, making up for his lacklustre years at High Wycombe technical high school. He wrote his first story while still at school: The Hades Business, originally published in the school magazine. It became his first professional sale when it was picked up later by the magazine Science Fantasy. He went into local journalism, working on the Bucks Free Press, and later on the Western Daily Press and Bath Chronicle. While working as a journalist, he wrote innumerable short stories for the newspapers under pen names. Not long after the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979, he worked as a publicity officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, and was paid to issue public information about the safety of three nuclear power stations. His nuclear masters had presumably assured him that British reactors were not the sort that melted down. He sold his first few books at this time. He left the CEGB to become a full-time writer in 1987, when offered a deal for the next three Discworld books. Such a multi-book contract for an almost unknown writer indicated that something special was going on. From the outset his career had unusual qualities. Pratchett’s first fantasy book was The Carpet People, written when he was 18; he rewrote it 30 years later, having revised and reversed his ideas about the importance of kings and wars. It was originally published in 1971 by a local publisher, Colin Smythe Ltd, based in Gerrards Cross. Smythe published the next two or three novels, licensing other editions in British paperback and in the US, but as Pratchett’s popularity grew it became clear to everyone that a larger publisher would be better equipped to promote his books. Smythe stepped aside as publisher and became Pratchett’s agent instead. Thereafter, hardbacks appeared from large publishers, beginning with Gollancz. Most of Pratchett’s books are set on Discworld, a flat, circular planet where the seas perpetually pour over the sides. Curious sailors who noticed that other ships seemed to disappear over the horizon, and went out to explore, discovered that they truly did disappear. The disc is supported, as if in Hindu mythology, by four large elephants, and they are resting on the back of a frost-covered turtle (gender unknown, although naughty people have tried to find out by building a gantry over the edge and climbing down for a quick peek), which swims sedately through space. At first, Discworld was used as a background for a series of comic sendups of other fantasy cliches but, as Pratchett himself said, if that was all, he would have run out of steam after a couple of books. Discworld constantly evolved, and part of its fascination for readers was the way in which the background became deeper, more complex and in some cases darker, but nonetheless remained a background. Forty Discworld novels appeared. The emphasis was always on the comedy, the foibles and peccadilloes of the characters, a gentle cynicism about the ways of the world, a joy in puns, a love of irritating footnotes, a relish for the bathetic puncturing of the bombastic – and above all an irrepressible and infectious silliness. In a publishing world where popular success often equates to ill-written or hackneyed work, Pratchett’s novels, although in a racy, readable style, were constantly witty, with many cultural, vernacular and literary references. You never quite knew where the next association was coming from: you would find sideways references to HP Lovecraft, William Shakespeare, Beachcomber, Sellar and Yeatman, Thomas Hughes, Peter Shaffer (a good joke about Salieri), JRR Tolkien, Egyptology, vampirism, dragons. The name of the Welsh area of Discworld (very Welsh) has a sly reference to Dylan Thomas: Llamedos. People on Discworld often get things a bit muddled: a fad for Australian-style bush hats goes wrong at first, until the pioneer realises he should remove the corks from the bottles. A vampire gets a job as a press photographer, but inconveniently turns to dust when his flashgun goes off. In The Light Fantastic (1986), a librarian is turned into an orangutan by an errant spell. It suits him: people give him a lot of bananas, and clambering up to retrieve books from high shelves becomes a doddle. The orangutan was so popular with readers that he reappeared in most of the books that followed. That in turn led to Pratchett’s own passionate involvement with the Orangutan Foundation. In 1995 he went to Borneo with a TV crew and made a highly praised film about the endangered animals. The humour of the novels was likable and liked: most of Pratchett’s books sold on word of mouth, and the many conventions thrown in his honour were happy occasions. He gave his readers memorable hours of talks, interviews and jokes. Then, at the end of 2007, following what he thought was a mild stroke, Pratchett was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy, a form of Alzheimer’s. The onset was early (he was still in his 50s) but also slow. Higher intellectual capacity was not immediately affected. He was able to go on writing, but typing at a keyboard became a problem. He soon learned there was no cure, nor any realistic hope of one within his expected lifetime, and that Alzheimer’s, so widespread, so destructive not only of the sufferers but also their carers, was a Cinderella disease. UK government support for Alzheimer’s research was running at about 3% of the funding for cancer research. Pratchett immediately donated $1m to Alzheimer’s Research UK, subsequently becoming a patron. His last years were astonishingly active. He continued to write fiction, learning to dictate rather than type, and a last Discworld novel was completed and delivered last summer. In July, he had to cancel a planned appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention – it was the first time he had ever missed the event. Three novels in collaboration with Stephen Baxter were also completed in this period, as well as collections of essays and short stories. In 2010 he wrote and introduced the BBC Richard Dimbleby lecture, which was an impassioned plea for the right of assisted suicide. The lecture was read for him by Tony Robinson, whom the author introduced as a “stunt Terry”. He was appointed OBE in 1998, and knighted in 2009. He remarked that now everyone would know that he was married to a lady, something he had been aware of for many years – he and Lyn Purves were married in 1968. Their daughter, Rhianna, is also a professional writer of many years’ standing. He is survived by both. • Terence David John Pratchett, novelist, born 28 April 1948; died 12 March 2015"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-15T18:30:01Z","webTitle":"The woman who faces the wrath of North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/mar/15/park-yeon-mi-north-korea-defector","fields":{"headline":"The woman who faces the wrath of North Korea","bodyText":"What does a nuclear power with the fifth largest army in the world have to fear from a pint-sized university student in a pink frock? A great deal, apparently. On 31 January 2015, a North Korean government-run website posted an 18-minute video titled The Human Rights Propaganda Puppet, Yeon-mi Park, which denounced the charismatic 21-year-old defector. It was the latest attack in a smear campaign aimed at silencing Yeon-mi, a human rights activist and outspoken critic of the world’s most repressive and secretive regime. Attacks on prominent North Korean defectors are nothing new. These individuals regularly endure charges that they lie and exaggerate. Occasionally there are death threats. Park Sang-hak, who launches helium balloons laden with USB sticks and anti-regime leaflets into North Korean airspace, has been called “human scum” who will “pay for his crimes in blood”. Sometimes the threats go beyond mere rhetoric: in 2011, a hitman with a poison-tipped needle was intercepted in South Korea on his way to kill Park Sang-hak. In 1997 the nephew of one of Kim Jong-il’s mistresses was gunned down outside Seoul; he had recently published an expose about the dictator’s family. But the regime’s most common weapon against its critics is character assassination. “One of the very few growing industries in North Korea is this operation of trying to compromise defectors and witnesses,” says Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The smears and threats have ramped up in the wake of a UN report documenting crimes against humanity in North Korea and recommending that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court. The UN findings were based on the testimony of more than 300 defectors who painted a picture of institutionalised cruelty within the regime, including mass incarceration in forced labour camps. North Korea has tried – unsuccessfully – to discredit the entire report because one of its well-known witnesses, Shin Dong-hyuk, later admitted to changing parts of his biography. “The fundamental building blocks of Shin’s story remain the same,” says Scarlatoiu. “He was still a political prisoner and still tortured.” But the controversy highlights a tragic catch-22: sometimes the traumatic firsthand experiences that make defectors such powerful witnesses also make them vulnerable to assaults on their credibility. Yeon-mi did not testify before the UN inquiry, but became a YouTube sensation last autumn, following her emotional speech at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: “North Korea is an unimaginable country,” she began in halting English. “We aren’t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.” She said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime. When she was nine years old she saw her friend’s mother publicly executed for a minor infraction. When she was 13, she fled into China, only to see her mother raped by a human trafficker. Her father later died in China, where she buried his ashes in secret. “I couldn’t even cry,” she said. “I was afraid to be sent back to North Korea.” Eventually Yeon-mi and her mother escaped into Mongolia by walking and crawling across the frozen Gobi desert, following the stars north to freedom. By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to “shed light on the darkest place in the world”, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet. After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea’s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi’s “collaborator” – a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative – I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi’s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal. As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family’s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier – Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea – and many other societies – admitting to such a “shameful” past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life. She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate. With Yeon-mi’s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn’t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them. Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory. It turns out that scrambling details and confusing time frames is actually a sign that the trauma survivor is being truthful – they honestly can’t remember things in sequence. Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: “Traumatised people don’t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn’t mean their story isn’t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.” According to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors’ stories as a weapon to attack their motives. A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help “spread her lies”. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive. Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. “Hunger is humiliation,” he says. “Hunger is helplessness.” But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea. “This is an important part of my story,” said Kim, “that I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.” Does this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man’s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced. • Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

Analysts from Greenpeace’s Energydesk compiled data from the German government that shows burning Europe’s reserves of lignite would wipe out the EU’s entire carbon budget from 2020 until the end of the century. Lignite – also known as brown coal – power stations currently make up more than 10% of the EU’s total CO2 emissions. Greenpeace said that if Europe is to continue to play its part in keeping the world within the internationally accepted limit of 2C of warming, 90% of the carbon contained in its lignite reserves must remain buried. Despite this, lignite-fuelled power stations are still being built, locking in consumption of the fuel for decades. There are 19 such facilities in various stages of approval, planning or construction in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Germany, Poland, Romania and Slovenia. Greenpeace figures show these new projects alone would emit almost 120m tonnes of CO2 every year – equivalent to three-quarters of the annual carbon output of the UK’s energy sector. The average lifespan for a coal power station is about 40 years, meaning the plants could release nearly 5bn tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Greenpeace energy analyst Jimmy Aldridge said: “The expansion of lignite mining in Europe is today the most serious symptom of the continent’s chronic addiction to dangerous fossil fuels, and a massive threat to its efforts to tackle climate change. The companies involved will continue for as long as they can – we need our political leaders to act in order to stop this situation from getting worse. [Barack] Obama has taken decisive action against coal in the US, it’s time European leaders did the same.” But Max Grünig, an energy sector economist at the Ecologic Institute in Germany, said the continued burning of lignite did not represent an immediate threat to carbon targets. “The total cap for the EU emissions trading scheme is decreasing and ensures that the energy sector is on track to meet the climate targets. If there are more coal power plants, they will have to compensate by buying emissions allowances from other sectors, but net emissions of CO2 cannot increase.” Grünig said the strategic reliance on lignite in politically powerful Poland and Germany had made these countries resistant to more ambitious emissions targets. Poland was especially belligerent during the process of creating the 2030 emissions target of a 40% reduction by 2030. “Poland is in the sad position to depend mostly (above 90%) on coal and has therefore very high costs associated with stricter emissions targets. Thus, they have to resist proposals for stricter targets in their own financial interest. It’s a trap,” he said. On Saturday, 7,500 Greenpeace protesters created a human chain across the German-Polish border. The symbolic gesture linked two villages earmarked for destruction to make room for the planned expansion of an open cut lignite mine. On the German side of the border in Lusatia, Sweden’s state energy company Vattenfall operates mines and power stations that emit as much CO2 as the whole of Sweden, according to Greenpeace figures. The company is looking to expand its mining operations at three of its existing sites. Greenpeace claims Vattenfall also has two entirely new mines in the planning process as well as a new power station. Vattenfall says there are no new mines being planned. But a spokesperson for Vattenfall said new power infrastructure was dependent on the approval of expanded mining operations. “As long as the extension of Jänschwalde opencast mine will be agreed by the states government of Brandenburg, in a midterm there will be needed a newly built power plant in Jänschwalde.” Lignite is an increasingly important part of the world’s energy supply. Consumption in Europe has remained stable since the late 1990s, but grew slightly over the past few years on the back of high gas prices and the scaling back of nuclear power in Germany. In Poland, lignite burning increased 3.7% in 2012, a year when power demand was actually falling. A recent analysis by Standard and Poor’s found that 50-60% of the world’s coal reserves were low-quality, high-emitting coals such as lignite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/17/china-britain-nuclear-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T14:30:01Z","webTitle":"What does China want with Britain's nuclear industry? | Isabel Hilton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/17/china-britain-nuclear-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/17/china-britain-nuclear-industry","fields":{"headline":"What does China want with Britain's nuclear industry?","bodyText":"For a chancellor so keen on the defence of UK national sovereignty against democratic Europeans, George Osborne's unbridled enthusiasm for Chinese investment in the UK's critical infrastructure is striking. If all these memorandums of understanding come to fruition, Chinese entities will hold important stakes in water in the UK, airports, IT infrastructure and now nuclear power generation, all without a serious national debate on any potential risks such involvement might bring. Since the Chinese government does its homework, it knows that Osborne represents a country reduced to penury by the financial crisis, and with some tricky, big-ticket items on its wishlist. Since the Chinese appreciate deference from their visitors, they must have been delighted by the chancellor. Britain is open for business, as he likes to say. Just make me an offer. Neither China's sovereign wealth fund nor its state-owned enterprises are philanthropic. All have large war chests, and their search for profitable, secure investments around the world has stimulated competition among aspirant recipients. But good bargains are not always done in haste and a number of unanswered questions hang over China's proposed investment, future majority stake-holding and possible future operational involvement in Britain's nuclear power. Some are hardy perennials: the world has 270,000 tonnes of high-level waste in temporary storage, an unlovely heap that grows by 10,000 tonnes each year. In 50 years of nuclear power, nobody has come up with a workable plan for the million years that safety regulations demand. Are the costs of that, and of decommissioning, built into the deal and if so, who pays? Then there is public subsidy: nobody has ever built a nuclear power plant without it, but the mandatory opening up of European electricity systems to competition means consumers are no longer obliged to underwrite unlimited costs, or to pay for expensive nuclear energy. This transfers the financial risk to the owners and financiers – hence the difficulty of finding the cash. What is different here? French enthusiasm is explained by the attempt to save their industry after decades of nuclear chill: Japan's plants are currently shuttered, for obvious reasons; new licensing is suspended in the United States; many countries (Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium) are phasing out nuclear power, or have never had it (Ireland, Austria, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Italy and Denmark). But what is in it for China? China has been the global nuclear industry's main hope of survival in recent years. It is a newcomer, starting to build its first commercial reactor only in 1985. It now has 16 in operation and a further 26 under construction, and more are planned. Now China hopes to become the world's next big nuclear exporter and sees involvement in a British plant as a key step to gaining credibility in the market. This is an ambitious programme, not least on the management side. Most nuclear accidents resulted from human error and today industry experts are worried by China's weak regulatory structure and its unproven capacity to build a safe management culture at such speed. Even in China, post Fukushima, public anxiety over the nuclear programme has begun to spill out on to the streets: earlier this year, public protests halted the construction of a waste processing plant in Guangdong that the authorities had insisted was perfectly safe. Surely we, too, should be asking more questions of a chancellor who appears to think that Chinese money buys him out of the intractable difficulties and uncertain costs of nuclear power? Will British consumers end up paying high energy prices to guarantee a Chinese investor a good return? What future leverage will Chinese investment in British infrastructure give to an emerging power that frequently says it does not accept established global rules? What degree of transparency and accountability can we, as supplicants, enforce on our new partner? What guarantee have we that in depending on Chinese finance, we haven't surrendered more than we bargained for? Perhaps it is not too late to ask."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/26/energy-privatisation-debate-energy-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-26T20:40:00Z","webTitle":"Do Britain's energy firms serve the public interest? | Will Hutton and Philip Booth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/26/energy-privatisation-debate-energy-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/26/energy-privatisation-debate-energy-firms","fields":{"headline":"Do Britain's energy firms serve the public interest?","bodyText":"Yes. The market is dysfunctional. We need to shape dynamic capitalism for the good of society, argues Will Hutton Capitalism is the best and worst of systems. Left to itself, it will embrace the new and relentlessly follow the logic of prices and profit, a revolutionary catalyst for necessary change. But it can only ever react to today's prices, which cannot capture what will happen tomorrow. So, left to itself, capitalism will neglect both the future and the cohesion of the society in which it trades. What we know, especially after the financial crisis of 2008, is that we can't leave capitalism to itself. If we want it to work at its best, combining its dynamism with public and social objectives, there is no alternative but to design the markets in which it operates. We also need to try to embed into its calculus wider obligations than the simple pursuit of economic logic. Otherwise, there lies disaster. If this is now obvious in banking, it has just become so in energy. Since 2004, consumers' energy bills have nearly trebled, far more than the rise in energy prices. The energy companies demand returns nearly double those in mass retailing for a good that is essential to life. This would be problematic at any time, but when wages in real terms have fallen by some 10% in five years it constitutes a crisis. John Major, pointing to the mass of citizens who now face a choice between eating or being warm – as he made the case for a windfall profits tax on energy companies – drove home the social reality. The energy market, as it currently operates, is dysfunctional and illegitimate. There has to be change. The problem is simple. The dynamics of today's electricity and gas markets do not create companies or business strategies in which public interest objectives and social obligations are sufficiently prioritised. Instead, every dysfunction is passed on to consumers in their bills, which have become the most regressive element in disposable household incomes. Energy costs are now as toxic as Mrs Thatcher's poll tax, perhaps even more so. BBC Radio 4's Question Time audience cheer the idea of nationalising the energy companies. The design of this market is now universally recognised as wrong, universally, that is, while excepting the regulator and the government. The energy companies are able to disguise their cost structures because there is no general pool into which they are required to sell their energy – instead opaquely striking complex internal deals between their generating and supply arms. Yet this is an industry where production and consumption is 24/7 and whose production logic requires such energy pooling. The sector has informally agreed, without regulatory challenge, that it should seek a supply margin of 5% – twice that of retailing. Hence, without overt collusion all the recent proposed tariff increases are around 10% to achieve this target benchmark. On top the industry also requires long-term price guarantees for investment in renewables and nuclear without any comparable quid pro quo in lowering its target cost of capital. The national grid, similarly privately owned, balances its profit maximising aims with a need to ensure security of supply. And every ambitious commitment to decarbonise British energy supply by 2030 is passed on to the consumer, rich and poor alike, whatever their capacity to pay. This is a market designed by its hapless regulator, Ofgem, to produce an energy poll tax. It will also lead to negligible new investment unless backed by government guarantees and subsidies. It could scarcely be worse – and with so much energy capacity closing in the next two years constitutes a first-order national crisis. Importantly, David Cameron's first reaction is not to order a competition commission inquiry, so far resisted by the regulator and, with the honourable exception of EDF, by most of the industry. This would have been the strategic response to what is clearly a strategic problem, and would expose the series of wrong decisions taken by Ofgem and indeed the government. Instead, the response is to dodge the strategic question and join the climate change deniers by blaming the problem on the alleged millstone of Britain's green commitments. It is Cameron at his slick and short-term worst. For a start, only £112 of the average £1,415 energy bill is represented by green commitments. Some of these are the subsidies to support investment in renewables, notably wind; some to promote more energy-efficient homes, typically older houses occupied by Britain's poorest; and some to install smart meters that will empower consumers to better control their energy usage as well as automatically buying for them energy from the cheapest supplier. Which of these does Cameron wish to abandon? And if he scrapped the lot the reality of a badly designed market would remain, bringing scant relief on bills while forgoing huge benefits. The real enemy of the piece is that the current energy industry structure is pitched in a no man's land. It is not the deregulated market of the imagination of an ideological pamphlet from the Institute of Economic Affairs, which would deliver neither investment, nor low prices, nor decarbonisation nor security of supply. But neither is it a structure in which there is an intelligent amalgam of public guarantees and private company dynamism. It is a bodge. The general direction of reform is clear. Energy companies should be required to sell their electricity into a pool whose price would become the base price for retail. This would remove at a stroke the ability to mask the relationship between costs and prices: retail prices would fall as well as rise clearly and unambiguously as pool prices changed. The grid, which delivers electricity and gas into our homes and is the guarantor that the lights won't go out, must be in public ownership, as is Network Rail in the rail industry. It should also be connected to a pan-European grid for additional security. Green commitments should be paid out of general taxation to strip the poll tax element out of energy bills, with the rich paying more than the poor for the public good. Because returns on investment take decades in the energy industry, despite what free market fundamentalists argue, the state has to overtly underwrite energy investment as it is doing with nuclear and renewables. But the quid pro quo, as argued by energy expert Professor Dieter Helm, should be that energy companies have to accept that their cost of capital is thus lower because the risk element has been withdrawn – a new compact between the energy sector and government. They are, after all, utilities – a crucial part of our social as well as economic landscape. Ed Miliband's proposed price freeze has caught the headlines. It is in effect a windfall tax on energy companies as they pay to hedge prices in the forward markets but which will be felt by the consumer as a price freeze. Less discussed are the other elements in his policy – notably pooling supply – which cautiously head in the right direction. Effective capitalism requires careful design and organisation, along with firms that combine a business and social purpose. Banking learnt this lesson: energy companies are next in line. What we should embrace is the revival of the mixed economy – a precondition for a return to the prosperity and productivity that was sacrificed on the altar of market fundamentalism. No. Far from a return to nationalisation, more liberalisation is what is required, argues Philip Booth The British energy industry has gone from nationalisation to privatisation and back to government control in the space of 25 years. Although the energy industry is nominally in private hands, we have exactly the same approach of government picking winners and dictating investment plans that was followed with disastrous consequences from the second world war to the mid 1980s. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the consumer got a raw deal because long-term investment plans and contracts promoted by the government required electricity companies to use expensive indigenous coal. Government planning also dictated the development of a nuclear programme that is probably one of the most expensive government project disasters in history, losing £32bn. The energy industry is, once again, controlled by the state. The same underlying drivers dictate policy in the new world of state control. It is not rational economic thinking and public-interested civil servants that determine policy, but interest groups. Going back 30 years, it was the coal industry – both management and unions – and the nuclear industry that dictated policy. Tony Benn said he had \"never known such a well-organised scientific, industrial and technical lobby\". Today, it is green pressure groups, EU parliamentarians and commissioners and, often, the energy industry itself that are loading burdens on to consumers. When the state controls the energy industry, whether through the back or the front door, it is vested interests that get their way and the consumer who pays. So how did we get to where we are today? In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the industry was entirely privatised. It was recognised that there were natural monopoly elements and so prices in these areas were regulated. At the same time, the regulator was given a duty to promote competition. From 1998, all domestic energy consumers could switch supplier for the first time and then wholesale markets were liberalised, allowing energy companies to source the cheapest forms of energy. Arguably, this was the high water mark of the liberalisation of the industry. Privatisation was a great success. Instead of investment policy being dictated by the whims of government and interest groups, it became dictated by long-term commercial considerations. From 1986 to 1997, domestic gas bills fell by an average of 2.6% a year in real terms – a very large cumulative reduction. From 1990 to 1999, electricity charges for domestic consumers fell by 26%, with a larger fall for industrial users. There is no point arguing that this was due to falling world energy prices – until privatisation, electricity companies had to use expensive domestic fuels. The political special interests under nationalisation required the use of expensive and dirty fuels. Sadly, the era of liberalised markets, rising efficiency and lower bills did not last long. Both the recent Labour governments and the coalition have pursued similar policies of intervention after intervention to send the energy industry almost back to where it started. In the first place, there are carbon reduction targets. Even if carbon reduction is deemed desirable, it could have been achieved through the emissions trading scheme: after all, the purpose of that scheme is to cap carbon emissions at a particular level. If the cap is appropriate, the scheme should work. Alternatively, a simple carbon tax could be charged. A carbon tax would allow energy businesses and consumers to reduce carbon emissions in the most efficient way for them – turning the heating down, installing insulation or, perhaps, buying energy from a company that uses non-carbon generation. But the government thinks it knows best, so it has added to the emissions trading scheme a carbon price floor, a requirement to allow households to produce their own electricity and sell it back, and an obligation to produce energy using incredibly expensive renewables. As part of its renewable strategy, in a strange echo of the 1970s, the government has signed a long-term contract for nuclear power to be supplied at twice the current price of electricity. If we can find a bad deal, let's lock it in for 35 years! That is exactly what governments did with centralised coal contracts in the postwar period. Some of the renewables promoted by government are nearly three-and-a-half times more expensive than the cheapest methods of generating electricity. All these costs raise the price of energy to consumers. In addition, we also have state-dictated investment plans. Consumers deserve better. One issue that unites left and many on the paternalist right, such as the US neo-cons, is that of energy security. Do we not need government intervention to keep the lights on and ensure that we are not over-reliant on energy from unstable countries? Perhaps the possibilities of fracking will consign this debate to the dustbin. However, it should be noted that there is nothing more insecure than energy arising from a policy determined by vested interests without any concern for commercial considerations. Was coal secure in the 1970s? Certainly not. Is onshore wind secure? No: the coldest winters are the stillest. Energy security will not be achieved by requiring energy companies to invest in expensive sources of supply and by rendering past investments redundant through regulation. It will also not be achieved by making the investment environment even more uncertain. Several companies all seeking the cheapest supplies from diverse sources will best serve the interests of energy security. The UK once had an inefficient and expensive energy industry. After privatisation, costs plummeted as the industry served the consumer rather than the mining unions and pro-nuclear interests. Today, after a decade or more of increasing state control, we have an industry that serves vested interests rather than the consumer interest once again. Electricity prices before taxes are now 15% higher than the average of major developed nations. Electricity could be around 50% cheaper without government interventions. We must liberalise again and not complete the circle by returning to nationalisation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/dec/12/-sp-shinzo-abe-japan-election-guardian-briefing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-12T14:34:36Z","webTitle":"Shinzo Abe and the Japanese election – the Guardian briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/-sp-shinzo-abe-japan-election-guardian-briefing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/12/-sp-shinzo-abe-japan-election-guardian-briefing","fields":{"headline":"Shinzo Abe and the Japanese election – the Guardian briefing","bodyText":"What’s the story? Japan goes to the polls on Sunday after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, called a snap election he hopes will give his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) a greater mandate for economic reforms. The election caught almost everyone by surprise, not least voters and the opposition parties. Surveys show that most people question the need to go to the polls again, just two years after Abe and the LDP were elected by a landslide. They have good reason to be skeptical. The LDP, along with its much smaller junior coalition partner, Komeito, now controls both houses of parliament, ending the legislative deadlock that frustrated previous administrations. How this happened After a decade that saw leaders come and go in quick succession, Abe has managed to close the revolving door to the prime minister’s office and secure some semblance of stability. That said, the resignations of two cabinet ministers in September were uncomfortable reminders of his first term as leader - for a year from autumn 2006 – when he was forced out following a string of scandals involving senior colleagues. Abe’s approval ratings are at their lowest since he took office in December 2012, but he still had two years left in his current term to complete his economic programme and try to win over voters. Victory on Sunday would buy Abe valuable time – perhaps as many as four more years – and allow him to claim a fresh mandate for his deflation-busting economic policy. Put crudely, this is about self-preservation for Abe. He called the election immediately after GDP data for the third quarter showed that Japan had slipped back into recession. The cabinet office said this week that the third-quarter contraction had been even deeper than previously thought. Abe has simply cut and run while he still has the chance. The issues The economy Abe’s answer to Japan’s economic woes is Abenomics - a three-pronged policy of monetary easing, public spending and structural reform. LDP candidates believe they are submitting themselves to voters’ mid-term verdict on both these policies and Abe’s decision, on the same day he called the snap poll, to put off until 2017 a rise in the sales tax originally planned for next year. An increase in sales tax in April battered consumer spending, a big factor in Japan’s return to recession. In postponing the rise, Abe defied fiscal hawks in his own party who want to prioritise raising revenue to meet rising social security costs for the elderly and to start paying off the country’s huge public debt. He has described Sunday’s vote as a de facto referendum on his economic policy. Nuclear power Abe is expected early next year to give final approval to the restart of two nuclear reactors. Japan’s atomic plants have been largely idle since the March 2011 disaster at Fukushima Daiichi. While most people in Japan oppose restarts, Abe believes nuclear must be part of the energy mix in resource-poor Japan, which has been forced to import record quantities of fossil fuels from overseas. That has worsened Japan’s trade deficit and raised doubts about its ability to meet climate change commitments. Military policy Victory on Sunday will boost attempts by Abe and his fellow conservatives to further loosen the political shackles on Japan’s self-defence forces – actually a highly trained, well-equipped army, navy and air force. Japan’s conservative leader has abandoned – for now – his quest to revise the US-authored constitution, which restricts Japan’s military to a strictly defensive role. Instead, he is expected to introduce legislation that will re-interpret the war-renouncing clause of the constitution to lift the postwar ban on collective self-defence. In practical terms, that would allow troops to come to the aid of an ally under attack – most likely the US – and fight on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war. Is an election upset on the cards? No. Barring a catastrophic scandal in which the prime minister himself is implicated, the election result is a foregone conclusion. Some polls are predicting that the LDP-Komeito coalition will easily retain its two-thirds “super majority”, so the political landscape is unlikely to change. The main opposition, the left-of-centre Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), is still in disarray after a tumultuous three years in office that ended in December 2012. Senior DPJ officials have conceded that the party still has a long way to go to rebuild its shattered support base. The only significant change would be if the LDP secures a two-thirds majority in the 475-seat lower house without help from Komeito. That would embolden Abe in his quest to alter Japan’s defence posture, as his party would no longer be reliant on votes from its more dovish coalition partner in the upper house. The view from the neighbours China and South Korea appear more interested in the election than poll-weary Japanese voters. Japan’s relations with Beijing and Seoul have worsened since Abe became prime minister. The bitter territorial row with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands predates Abe’s 2012 victory, but his revisionist impulses have only added to the mutual suspicion and mistrust clouding regional diplomacy. Japan’s neighbours will respond cautiously to any change in its defence posture. They will also keep a close watch on Abe’s official statements to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in the Pacific next August. Historical revisionists – including Abe – have angered South Korea by undermining the widely accepted narrative of the “comfort women”: tens of thousands of mainly Asian women who were forced to work in Japanese military brothels in the 1930s and 40s. While Abe has stopped short of watering down an official 1993 apology to the surviving victims, he claims there is no evidence they were coerced. How can I find out more? The online English-language editions of Japan’s major newspapers – the Yomiuri, Mainichi, Asahi and Nikkei – are covering the election, as is the global service of public broadcaster NHK. Michael Cucek, an adjunct fellow at Temple University in Tokyo, can be relied upon for clear, concise – and occasionally acerbic – insights at his Shisaku blog. Cucek appears alongside Insideline editor in chief, Takao Toshikawa – who has a solid reputation for correctly predicting Japanese election results – in a recent discussion about Abe’s post-election prospects. The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan has continued its tradition of inviting senior party officials to put their case before the international media. Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP heavyweight and now leader of the People’s Life party, appeared last week, followed by Kazuo Shii, leader of the Japanese Communist party. The LDP and Komeito, alas, were “too busy” to send representatives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/12/did-coalition-live-up-to-greenest-government-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Coalition Britain: has the ‘greenest ever’ government lived up to its promise?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/12/did-coalition-live-up-to-greenest-government-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/12/did-coalition-live-up-to-greenest-government-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Coalition Britain: has the ‘greenest ever’ government lived up to its promise?","bodyText":"It was on a broiling summer’s day last August that Hoovergate broke. Brussels bureaucrats were about to ban high-powered vacuum cleaners, and every Tory criticism of the green agenda collided in one nightmarish Daily Mail headline. After protests over onshore windfarms and outrage over higher energy bills because of the levy for renewable investments, the EU was even going to make housework tougher for hard-pressed voters. A few days later, Douglas Carswell became the first Tory backbencher to resign from the party to defect to Ukip. Carswell’s concerns went much wider than the wattage of vacuum cleaners, but his decision propelled a party that questions the very existence of climate change into the mainstream debate. The Conservatives, who pledged in 2010 that the coalition would be the “greenest government ever”, now faced a triple threat to that promise: the recession, Ukip and a politically toxic EU. “Don’t expect climate change to feature in the election campaign,” said one of the greener Tory MPs. It had all been so different for David Cameron back in 2005. He’d recognised that the message of social justice implicit in the green agenda could be an important way of making people see Conservativism differently. Most people remember the Arctic trip with the huskies. The pledge to rule out a third runway at Heathrow was more significant. After the inconclusive election in 2010, the coalition’s programme for government had more about climate change than about cutting the deficit. On 14 May, three days after becoming prime minister, Cameron went to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) to declare his would be “the greenest government ever”. He even appointed himself the department’s “fourth minister”. Decc officials talk of the “energy trilemma” that faces every secretary of state: keeping the lights on, holding down electricity bills and decarbonising supply. The department must control the source of the problem and devise solutions for it. The “greenest ever” pledge was repeated in the coalition’s first Queen’s speech. In the first budget, before a year of eye-watering cuts, Decc got one of the best settlements. Yet within a year, the rhetoric had changed completely. There was a reason why there was so much detail on climate change in the coalition agreement. The Liberal Democrats, always an environmentalist party, were there as a counterweight for the sceptical Tory right. Chris Huhne, the first secretary of state, who had made his pitch for the 2006 and 2007 party leadership contests on a green agenda, was up for the fight. “His approach to the Treasury was that you can’t negotiate with terrorists,” one ally said later. It was an approach that produced impressive policy gains, most notably in 2011, with the Fourth Carbon budget, which set emissions reduction targets for 2023-27, the next stepping stone to the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions (using 1990 as a baseline). In the end, the Treasury, long the enemy of all things green, particularly where it means subcontracting revenue raising powers, conceded a deal on the condition that it would be reviewed in 2014. Huhne’s successor, Ed Davey, managed to protect the targets, but only by trading concessions on fracking. “Chris Huhne was knowledgeable and effective,” said Tim Yeo, the Conservative chair of the cross-party energy and climate change committee of MPs, “but politically it is not smart to upset the Treasury. Decc is a small, junior department. It’s always a first cabinet job for its secretary of state. Any Whitehall negotiation is always an away match.” Huhne fought to a score draw on the Green Investment Bank, bidding the Treasury up to a capital allocation of £3bn for hard-to-finance green projects, but conceding the battle over borrowing powers. But it was also on his watch that the disastrous Green Deal was devised. The deal was at the centre of Huhne’s energy bill in 2011. It was supposed to be a way of encouraging home owners to invest in energy-saving improvements with loans advanced through their energy bills. Overly complex and badly structured, it was a policy that sank, taking with it a great chunk of the coalition’s reputation for being able to make a difference in an area that is increasingly contested. As the oil price crossed the $100 (£65) a barrel mark, energy bills became the battleground for a wider fight about the value of green policies. In rightwing newspapers, Huhne was accused of masterminding untested initiatives that were hitting families already struggling through a recession. A planned duty rise on petrol was abandoned in the face of ever increasing prices at the pumps. George Osborne told the Tory party conference in 2011: “We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.” The green lobbyist Alastair Harper said: “David Cameron took a deliberate decision to tone the rhetoric down. He decided he didn’t want to talk about [environmental issues] because he didn’t want to make it a cultural issue within the party. The tone changed, but the policy didn’t.” Rather than blame the real problems of rising fuel prices, an uncompetitive market and a weak regulator, it was the energy companies’ obligation (ECO) – levied on customers to pay for investment in renewables, the Green Deal and to help fuel-poor households – that was accused of over burdening the consumer. The collateral damage was investor confidence. The more the government’s commitment to long-term decarbonisation of the energy supply was challenged within its own ranks, the less willing the investors were to take the plunge. When Huhne was forced to resign in 2012 to fight (unsuccessfully) a charge of perverting the course of justice over a speeding penalty, Davey inherited a legacy that was a substantial structure still only half-built. Key projects such as the Green Deal were only just being implemented. To complicate matters, Decc suffers like many other Whitehall departments from a high staff turnover, partly as a result of a deliberate strategy. One of Yeo’s biggest criticisms of the department is the lack of continuity. “Just when they were most needed, the team of officials that worked on the Energy Act in 2011 was broken up,” he said. The appointment of a new permanent secretary was delayed for months after the prime minister intervened to stop a candidate considered “too green”. But that wasn’t the only reason why the Green Deal flopped. Environmental campaigners such as Harper bemoan the failure of successive ministers to make energy efficiency a priority in a cool country with a large proportion of old, inefficient housing stock. “We need an efficiency sector in the same way that policy has been directed into building a renewable sector.” The Green Deal and its new successor, the Green Deal home improvement fund, are both in effect middle-class subsidies, aimed at home owners with enough savings to put cash up front. Poorer families get help with their bills and with efficiency measures through the Affordable Warmth Scheme. Many young families fall between the two extremes and get no incentive at all. Davey, parachuted into a department that was simultaneously developing complex domestic policies and playing a leading role in multi-player global and EU negotiations, then lost the reliable and experienced minister Charles Hendry. His replacement, a sop to the restive right, was the anti-wind turbine campaigner John Hayes. One ex-cabinet minister, Peter Lilley, was secretly recorded claiming Hayes’s job was to “duff up” Davey. Davey only managed to see off Hayes by warning Cameron that the outspoken minister was destroying investor confidence. It was a sign Davey was in control. He won an important battle with the Treasury on the Levy Control Framework, getting approval for a peak of £7.6bn of funding to be available for investment in the renewable sector by 2020. But alongside the efforts to raise investment in renewables, there are the more contentious failures. Davey spent a year playing catch-up on electricity market reform. He lost the fight to get a decarbonisation target into the 2013 Energy Act. Early on, the Lib Dems were forced to drop their opposition to new nuclear power stations and negotiate what critics regard as the extortionately expensive deal for the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C. Carbon capture and storage technology has made no progress, and the new capacity contracts – the guarantee that the lights will stay on – have disappointed campaigners because of the reliance on fossil fuel. The good news comes from the international successes. Davey loyalists trumpet his role in getting an EU deal on a 40% cut in greenhouse gases by 2030, and praise the part he played in the last-minute deal at Lima that was a step towards success in the forthcoming UN climate change summit in Paris. And if the transformed global environment, with both China and the US now playing a serious part, is what really makes a difference, then at least the EU is not being left behind. “Ed Davey’s real regret,” said one of his closest allies, “is that he won’t be in Paris in December.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/aug/01/old-coal-subsidy-loophole-to-be-closed-by-uk-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-01T12:47:55Z","webTitle":"'Old coal' subsidy loophole to be closed by UK government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/01/old-coal-subsidy-loophole-to-be-closed-by-uk-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/aug/01/old-coal-subsidy-loophole-to-be-closed-by-uk-government","fields":{"headline":"'Old coal' subsidy loophole to be closed by UK government","bodyText":"A loophole in the government’s energy policy that could have seen billpayers funding billions of pounds of subsidy for old coal plants will be closed, officials have told the Guardian. The move is a victory for analysts and campaigners who argued large coal subsidies would heavily undermine ministers’ drive to reduce carbon emissions, as well as costing consumers dearly. However, some coal payments will remain and critics say the policy still undervalues energy saving measures. The loophole appeared in a new policy aimed at ensuring the lights stay on in the UK in coming years as ageing coal and nuclear power plants are closed. The so-called capacity market pays generators a fee simply to be available when needed and was meant to support new gas-fired power stations, which are about half as polluting as coal plants. However, old coal plants that invested in major upgrades to cut air pollutants such as nitrous oxides and sulphur oxides would also have been eligible for the longest 15-year subsidy deals. The thinktank e3g and campaigners Greenpeace calculated this could have led to £5-10bn being paid to old coal plants. The UK currently hosts nine of the top 30 most polluting coal plants in the EU and in 2013 coal had its greatest share of the energy market since 1970. But on Friday a spokeswoman from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) told the Guardian the loophole would be closed: “We are going to amend the capacity market rules to clarify without any doubt that only new projects can access the 15-year maximum term. We will be consulting on this shortly.” She added: “Existing plants undertaking refurbishment can access a maximum of three-year agreements.” A three-year deal would provide insufficient subsidy to make upgrading old coal plants financially viable. Greenpeace UK energy analyst Jimmy Aldridge said: “One colossal waste of billpayers’ money has now been ruled out, but the government is still offering ageing coal plants other subsidies worth hundreds of millions, putting our climate ambition at risk and locking us into more years of dependence on coal, the dirtiest of all fuels.” The closure of the loophole was very good news, said Prof Catherine Mitchell, an energy policy expert at the University of Exeter. “But continuing with a broad capacity mechanism that favours big power plants and existing big companies is still far inferior to a targeted alternative that includes cutting demand at key times and which would be cheaper, more flexible, a better fit with Europe, and much less easy to rig,” she said. Mitchell said enabling more big energy users to be paid for cutting demand at crunch times and building more interconnectors to other countries had worked better elsewhere. Companies can apply to take part in December’s capacity market auctions from Monday. Dave Jones, policy analyst at energy thinktank Sandbag, said the fundamental problem preventing the phase out of dirty coal-fired power plants was the very low cost of pollution permits in the EU’s emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). The recent recession and heavy lobbying from industry saw far too many permits available, meaning the price has been very low. “We are very happy that Decc has closed this absurd loophole but the battle against unabated coal is still far from won,” Jones said. “The UK now has to strain every sinew for a long term solution to this problem; meaningful reform to the EU ETS.” In July, the energy secretary, Ed Davey, called for a “significant number” of EU ETS permits to be cancelled, but other EU nations, led by Poland, are resistant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/sep/19/future-japan-fukushima-leaks-pm","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-19T11:15:22Z","webTitle":"Future of Japan depends on stopping Fukushima leaks, PM tells workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/19/future-japan-fukushima-leaks-pm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/19/future-japan-fukushima-leaks-pm","fields":{"headline":"Future of Japan depends on stopping Fukushima leaks, PM tells workers","bodyText":"Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has told workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that \"the future of Japan\" depends on their ongoing struggle to contain leaks of highly radioactive water at the site. Abe's brief visit to the stricken plant on Thursday – his second since he became prime minister last December – comes weeks after he reassured the world that the situation at the facility was under control, amid reports that large quantities of contaminated water were seeping into the Pacific ocean. Abe's reassurances are thought to have helped Tokyo's successful bid to host the 2020 Olympics, but were later challenged by a senior official at the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco]. On Thursday, Abe and his entourage, dressed in protective suits, masks and helmets, heard Tepco officials explain how they planned to prevent additional leaks from tanks that have been hastily built to store water that becomes contaminated after it comes into contact with melted nuclear fuel in damaged reactor basements. He also visited a water decontamination facility and a chemical dam being built along the coastline to contain leaks of groundwater into the Pacific ocean. The visit was designed to calm fears at home and overseas about safety at the plant, amid rising doubts about Tepco's ability to conduct the cleanup operation alone. This week it emerged that US experts had urged Japanese authorities to take immediate steps to prevent groundwater contamination two years ago, but their advice been ignored. Tepco reportedly lobbied against the proposed construction of a barrier – a measure that will now be taken with government funding – because it feared the high cost would spook investors and push the firm closer to insolvency. Charles Casto, a representative of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said discussions about a barrier had begun within weeks of the meltdown. \"It was obvious to us that there was great deal of groundwater intrusion into the plant, and we shared that with the Japanese government,\" he told Reuters. \"At the time, they didn't believe there was a significant amount of groundwater getting into the plant.\" Abe told some of the thousands of workers at the plant that the government would continue to support the utility during a long potentially hazardous decommissioning operation that is expected to last four decades. \"The future of Japan is on your shoulders,\" he said during a visit to the plant's command centre. \"The government will step forward and take concrete measures. I am counting on you to do your best.\" Later, he said he had told Tepco officials, including the firm's president, Naomi Hirose, to decommission reactors 5 and 6, which were not in operation when the plant was wrecked by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. Hirose said Tepco, which is hoping to restart some nuclear reactors to help repair its tattered finances, would make a decision on the two reactors by the end of the year. Reactors 1 to 4 have already been earmarked for decommissioning. Abe stood by his recent claim, made before members of the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aires earlier this month, that contaminated water had been prevented from flowing beyond the plant's harbour, and that the water crisis was under control. \"One of the main purposes of this visit was to see the situation for myself, having made those remarks on how the contaminated water is being been handled,\" he said, adding that the government believed the water issue would be resolved by the time the Games are held in 2020. \"As I stated in Buenos Aires, I am convinced that the contaminated water leaks have been confined to an area of 0.3 sq km within the cove next to the plant. \"In light of that, I will work hard to counter rumours questioning the safety of the Fukushima plant.\" Earlier this week, however, Kazuhiko Yamashita, a senior Tepco official, said the water leaks were not under control. \"Predictable risks are under control, but what cannot be predicted is happening,\" Japanese media quoted Yamashita as telling opposition MPs. \"We believe that the current conditions show that [the radioactive water problem] is not under control.\" Abe, accompanied by Tepco officials, was shown a water treatment facility that can remove radioactive materials from contaminated water. The equipment failed during an earlier a trial run and is now under repair. The plant's manager, Akira Ono, said it would be tested again later this year. Abe later inspected a water tank that last month leaked 300 tonnes of water, sending radiation levels in the immediate vicinity soaring. Ono said 90 Tepco workers were patrolling the plant's 1,000 water tanks four times a day, adding that gauges would soon be installed to monitor water levels in the tanks. Tepco hopes to replace suspect tanks with more reliable welded versions by the end of the year, he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/jul/31/british-gas-fall-in-energy-bills-centrica","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-31T19:09:00Z","webTitle":"British Gas predicts fall in energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/31/british-gas-fall-in-energy-bills-centrica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jul/31/british-gas-fall-in-energy-bills-centrica","fields":{"headline":"British Gas predicts fall in energy bills","bodyText":"Britain's largest domestic energy supplier, Centrica, has clashed with Ofgem over the regulator's claim that the industry was likely to double its profits over the next 12 months. The owner of British Gas said its household supply arm had recorded a 26% slump in profits in the first half of 2014 and there was no chance of a turnaround over the next year. \"We have 25 independent analysts following the company, and if you look at their forecasts for 2015, there isn't a single one who is forecasting that profit margins will double or anything like that,\" said Centrica's financial director, Nick Luff. Household bills at British Gas are predicted to be about £90 lower this year than in 2013, thanks to mild weather and a freeze on energy prices, said the company. It has lost 600,000 customers over the last year but still reported first half retail profits of £265m and Centrica group operating profits of just over £1bn. Ofgem said this week that its latest monthly estimates showed overall industry profits are likely to rise to £106 per household over the next year, up from £53 over the previous 12 months. British gas serves 11m homes. Luff, who will leave later this year as will Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, said Ofgem had been wrong in the past and noted that Centrica's forecast was based on actual consumption whereas the Ofgem used a \"theoretical model\". Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, disagreed. He said Ofgem's forecasts for the industry for the next 12 months was the latest example of an energy market that was not working. \"Britain's hard-pressed bill payers have seen their energy bills rocket, despite falling wholesale costs. That is why Labour would freeze energy bills until 2017 so prices cannot rise, and create a tough new watchdog with the power to force energy companies to cut their prices when wholesale costs fall.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: \"British Gas profits are down because of a warm winter, not lower prices. Energy companies must do everything they can to pass on any savings to their customers including falling wholesale and network costs.\" The energy sector is the subject of a wide-ranging investigation into profiteering by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Luff said Centrica has held meetings with the CMA and had its own small team working full-time on the inquiry but insisted the company was \"not fearful\" of the outcome of the investigation, which could lead to Britain's big six suppliers being broken up. SSE, ScottishPower, Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy control about 96% of the market. Luff noted that Centrica had put three gas-fired power stations up for sale two months ago and scrapped plans for an offshore windfarm, the Celtic Array off Anglesey. He said he would be leaving without regrets that Centrica should have done things differently despite mounting criticism from fuel poverty campaigners in recent years. \"We coped with quite dramatic changes in the shape of the energy market,\" he said. Centrica's chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, paid tribute to the \"exceptional leadership\" of Laidlaw, who will be replaced by BP executive Iain Conn. Figures from French-owned EDF – another of the big six suppliers, serving 4m households – showed that operating profits in Britain rose 9.5% to £560m for the first half of the year. It said the growth was the result of higher output from its nuclear power stations, compared with a period last year when more of its generating capacity was out of service for planned maintenance. EDF said a decline in gas sales due to milder weather was partly offset by 3.2% growth in customer accounts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/may/19/general-election-2017-theresa-may-manifesto-scotland-conservatives-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-19T16:14:14Z","webTitle":"General election 2017: Tories called 'utter hypocrites' for wanting winter fuel payment cuts for England but not Scotland – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/may/19/general-election-2017-theresa-may-manifesto-scotland-conservatives-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/may/19/general-election-2017-theresa-may-manifesto-scotland-conservatives-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"General election 2017: Tories called 'utter hypocrites' for wanting winter fuel payment cuts for England but not Scotland – as it happened","bodyText":"Conservative plans to end the pensions triple lock and means test the winter fuel allowance are a “savage attack on vulnerable pensioners”, John McDonnell has said, as he seeks to position Labour as the party representing older voters. The Tories have been accused of being “utter hypocrites” after it emerged that they want to cut winter fuel payments for pensioners in England but not in Scotland. On a trip to Edinburgh, Theresa May defended plans to protect winter fuel allowance for all Scottish pensioners while cutting it for many south of the border. She said: Well, we have devolution in the United Kingdom and, as a government, we have given the Scottish government significant powers in relation to welfare, and they make a number of decisions about various welfare benefits in Scotland. The decision we have made about winter fuel payments is that we will continue to ensure that the least well-off pensioners are supported but there is a principle of fairness. Scottish Tories are saying pensioners in Scotland should be exempt from the UK cuts, because the cold weather in the country increases the need for winter fuel payments (see 9.50am). Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said: We’ve made a different choice in Scotland in our Scottish manifesto today. We believe there shouldn’t be means testing for the winter fuel payment. But Labour and the Lib Dems said the fact that Scottish Tories could not support the policy showed it was in trouble. Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s elections coordinator, said: When the Scottish Tory leader comes out against her own party’s attack on pensioner incomes, I think it’s fair to say the policy is starting to unravel. The Tory attack on pensioners’ winter fuel allowance is unfair and outrageous, and lays bare the threat they pose to pensioners’ security and living standards. And the Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said: The Tories are utter hypocrites. How can they take cash off English pensioners and then give it to Scottish pensioners? It looks like a cheap election bung and it won’t wash. May has said she wants Scotland to play a bigger part in UK life. In a speech in Edinburgh stressing her commitment to the union, she said previous governments had been inclined to adopt a “devolve and forget” approach to Scotland (see 1pm). Tory plans for a 1% cap on public sector pay rises over the next two years could exacerbate recruitment problems, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said (see 2.07pm). Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, has dismissed an Ipsos Mori poll yesterday showing Ukip on just 2%, behind the Greens. He told Sky News: Ignore it, it’s Ipsos Mori. They always have us down in a way which is just unbelievable. They’re completely wrong. They’ve been wrong for five years. They’ve always got Ukip’s figures wrong, time and time again. Even when we were on 20%, Ipsos Mori would have us on 10%, so I’m not worried about that at all. There was another YouGov poll yesterday which had us on 6%. That’s roughly where I believe we are. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has pencilled in 19 June for the first formal day of talks with Britain about its withdrawal from the EU, in what are being billed as the most important negotiations in the country’s history. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Angus Robertson, the SNP’s deputy leader, said Theresa May’s speech at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto today amounted to a “get back in your box” message. He said: Theresa May flew into Edinburgh today to deliver one simple message to the people of Scotland – get back in your box. This carbon copy manifesto confirms beyond doubt that Tory MPs from Scotland will simply rubber-stamp Theresa May’s plans and endorse the damage she is determined to do to households and our economy. The Creative Industries Federation, which represents those working in arts and the creative industries, has announced that it has cancelled an election event planned with Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and Tom Watson, the deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, because members were not going to get enough time to ask questions. The federation set up election events with all the main parties, starting with a Tory one this week, in which Matt Hancock, the culture minister, took questions for nearly an hour. But, in a press statement, it said it had cancelled the Labour event planned for Monday in Hull because the party would not agree enough time for questions. It said: As Labour informed us that they were no longer able to devote a similar amount of time to questioning as the other parties have agreed to, we invited them to reconsider. When we could not agree, we had no choice but to pull out of the event. The federation – the national organisation for all the UK’s creative industries, cultural education and arts – has a track record for independence and fearlessness. We are, however, non-partisan. We cannot provide a backdrop for campaign events which do not offer the opportunity for proper scrutiny. Ruth Davidson has suggested the Tories will never consent to a second Scottish independence referendum until a “gold standard” test of unanimous party backing and support from a very large majority of Scottish voters has been met. The Scottish Tory leader, speaking to reporters after Theresa May launched the Scottish Conservative manifesto in Edinburgh, defended the manifesto’s stance that no referendum would be agreed without “public consent” and only once the Brexit process was complete. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and leader of the Scottish National party, wants a vote by spring 2019. Davidson and May have implied it would not be until the early 2020s – the timescale that they claim Brexit and new powers for Scotland will need to bed in. Asked to define public consent by a Daily Mail reporter, May sidestepped the question, arguing only that Brexit was the issue that mattered: “Talking about a second independence referendum right now doesn’t strengthen our hand, it weakens our hand.” Pressed on this after May’s speech, Davidson said: The best example we have is back in 2011-12, where we had every member of the Scottish parliament voting for it because we recognised that was a mandate for it to happen. We had 92% support across the country [from opinion polls]. There was public and parliamentary-stroke-political consent there. There was agreement across everyone that this should happen. And that was the gold standard … [I] would be happy to never have a referendum; I’m a unionist and I don’t want one. I have to say we need something a lot more like what we had in 2011-12 before I think the UK government should give its consent. I’m saying that’s the gold standard ... We have seen time and time again there is no public consent for it; people don’t want [to be] dragged back there. Davidson’s stance relies heavily on opinion polls showing that less than 45% of Scottish voters want a second independence vote until after Brexit, but it is risky. The same polls suggest support will rise once the Brexit deal is signed. The SNP will be working very hard to maximise and highlight every problem with the Brexit talks as it bids to increase public backing for a vote. The Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, has cancelled a day of campaigning in Essex after the party battle bus had a wing mirror knocked off, the Press Association reports: Nuttall was set to join party activists for two campaign events in the county, where the party had its only MP elected in Clacton. But the party’s distinctive purple battle bus was clipped by a lorry in a coach park overnight, taking a wing mirror off and grounding the Ukip campaign for a day while the bus gets fixed. A party spokesman said the events would be rescheduled soon. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a briefing paper on the Conservatives’ plans to make the elderly pay more towards the cost of social care in their own home. It says that between 12% and 17% of people in their 70s eligible for state support for care at home under the current system would not be eligible under the proposed changes. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, has said that the publication of the Conservative manifesto shows that “the nasty party is well and truly back”. Speaking while campaigning for Labour in Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls’ old seat, won by the Tories in 2015 with a majority of 422), he said: The Tory manifesto has unravelled in the last 24 hours in a way that I can’t remember manifestos unravelling. The truth is, there’s no costings, no clarity, no detail, but also this facade that somehow it’s a different type of Tory party. I think the facade has actually been shattered apart by what they’re doing to older people. The Tories have tried to say as little as possible in this campaign. Now they’ve tried to say what their plans are, I think people are looking at it and not liking it at all. Speaking to some Alzheimer’s Society campaigners he met on a walkabout, Miliband went on: I think the mask has slipped on the Conservative party with the publication of their manifesto. I think the nasty party is well and truly back and, if you look at them taking the winter fuel allowance away from 10 million pensioners, ending the triple lock, a tax on people who get dementia, I actually think that lots and lots of people are taking a second look at what the Tories are actually offering in this campaign and contrasting it to Labour: the investment in health and education and building a fairer society, guaranteeing pensioners the winter fuel allowance and the other benefits, including the triple lock … I think it’s all to play for in this campaign. According to the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman, Labour HQ is working on the assumption that the party will be left with just 140 seats after the election. Here’s an extract from her blog. I understand from two very good sources that this working assumption developed by Patrick Heneghan, the party’s elections director, is based on the party’s private data. This could mean that 89 sitting Labour MPs lose their seats – and means the party considers previously safe constituencies to be at risk. That must be one of the gloomiest forecasts around. But other predictions have not been a lot more encouraging for Labour. The Elections Etc blog, run by the academic Steve Fisher, has been compiling a list of the various election predictions in the public domain that are underpinned by some sort of methodology: models based on polling (either simple seat projections, or more complex ones, taking into account other factors), results implied by the betting markets, and wisdom-of-the-crowd mass forecasts. It published a summary of the latest data last week. Here it is. Of course, they could all be wrong. And these figures do not take into account polls over the past week, which have shown some movement towards Labour. Here is the FT’s latest poll tracker chart (subscription needed). London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has put out a statement about the Conservative manifesto. He’s calling it – with a certain amount of drama – “a kick in the teeth for London and every single Londoner”. His objections focus mainly on the idea of a so-called hard Brexit without access to the EU’s single market, which the Labour mayor says will harm the capital. He also dislikes the plan to greatly reduce net migration, saying it will “cause huge damage to our city’s economy”. Khan is concerned that the manifesto does not mention air quality, a particular health crisis in London, and is critical of the changes to social care, which he sees as particularly affecting Londoners given the city’s higher average property prices. The mayor’s statement also condemns the lack of a commitment to the Crossrail 2 network, and the plans to move Channel 4 and some civil servant jobs out of London. These last points might raise an eyebrow among non-London mayors, who regularly complain that the capital sucks up infrastructure investment and jobs. But it is Khan’s role to stick up for his city. Corbyn says the Conservatives’ underfunding of education means headteachers are going through the most “unbelievable stress” of having to decide which teachers to sack. He says he is very proud of the fact the Labour manifesto proposes free school meals. And there will be no tuition fees for students, he says. It is a huge cost and commitment, but Labour thinks everyone deserves a decent chance, he says. Corbyn turns to social care. It is very important for older people, he says, but it is also there for people with disabilities and learning difficulties. There are 1 million people who do not get the care to which they are entitled, he says. When people do not get the care they need, relatives have to step in. And it is almost always women, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking in Peterborough. He says winter fuel payments are there for a reason. Some older people die from the cold in the winter, he says. He says Labour will keep winter fuel payments. They go to everyone, he says. But wealthy pensioners do pay tax on them, he says. He says the Tories have not explained what they will do to winter fuel payments. He says Labour is also committed to keeping the triple lock on pensions. No other party has given that commitment, he says. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published an analysis looking at what will happen to public sector pay in the next parliament, depending on which party wins. This is the key graph. It shows average public sector pay (the line at the top) as a proportion of average private sector pay. It is about 11% higher at the moment (because the public sector employs a disproportionate number of professionals) and proportionally it was even higher during the financial crash, when private sector pay fell. As the red, yellow and blue lines show, public sector pay would be highest under Labour, and lowest under the Conservatives, with the Lib Dems somewhere in between. The IFS says there are arguments for and against boosting public sector pay. Without pay increases, the public sector will struggle to recruit and services could suffer, it says. But paying staff more leaves less money for other government spending. It says the Labour plans would require the government to be spending £9.2bn more a year on public sector pay by 2020-21 than under the Tory plans, with £2.9bn of that going to the NHS; under the Lib Dems, it would be £5.3bn more, with £1.6bn of that going to the NHS. Here is an extract from the IFS analysis. Since 2011, there has been significant pay restraint in the public sector. For a number of years this was achieved without significant recruitment and retention issues, probably because public pay had done so much better than private sector pay during the recession. However, these pressures are emerging now, and could harm the quality of public services. There are significant trade offs in the future setting of public sector pay. Restraining public sector pay compared to the private sector, as proposed by the Conservatives, and – to a lesser extent by the Liberal Democrats –risks exacerbating recruitment, retention and motivation problems and ultimately the quantity and quality of public services provided. On the other hand, increasing public sector pay results in significantly higher costs to public sector employers compared to the current Conservative government’s plans. The next government could decide to increase departmental spending to account for these higher costs of paying public sector workers. But if it did not provide extra funds, departments would need to make cuts elsewhere – for example by further reducing the number of public sector workers, cuts that may themselves reduce the quality of public services. Here is the latest feature in our voices and votes series. Reporter Lisa O’Carroll and photographer Murdo MacLeod meet a family in Glasgow East who are set to vote three different ways in the general election. Sky’s Faisal Islam has been tweeting some more background about winter fuel payments. Here are the latest YouGov polling figures for Scotland. Q: Why should English people pay for NHS prescriptions but not Scottish people? May says that is the whole point of devolution; the Scottish government is able to take its own decisions, she says. And that’s it. The press conference is over. Q: According to the polls you are on course to do well. How many seats would count as a success? May says she has made it a golden rule never to predict elections. The Conservatives are going out to earn the support of voters, she says. Q: How would you determine whether or not there is public consent for another independence referendum? May says the SNP has spoken about how this could be determined. But its threshold (clear support for independence in polls) has not been met. Q: How much will your programme cost to implement? It will be fiscally neutral, May says. She says the SNP has made Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK. That is not the way to encourage jobs, she says. May is now taking questions. Q: Why is it fair that an elderly person who gets cancer gets treated for free, and yet someone with dementia has to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds? May says the government will quadruple the amount of an individual’s assets that will be protected. She wants to provide dignity for people in old age, but ensure fairness across the generations. Q: What is your view of Julian Assange? Would you respect an extradition request from the US? May says extradition requests are dealt with on a case by case basis. Q: Nicola Sturgeon says if she wins the election, she should have a place in the Brexit talks. Will you allow that? May says the talks will take place between the UK government and the EU. She will negotiate on behalf of the whole of the UK. May says Scottish education under the SNP is a “scandal”. After a decade of SNP neglect, standards in Scottish education – which were once the envy of the civilised world – have become a national scandal. The SNP’s tunnel-vision obsession with independence above everything else has meant young people in Scotland are being let down. Education might be a devolved matter – but I still care very deeply about the life chances of Scottish children. As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I care just as much about the futures of children from Ayrshire and Angus as I do about the futures of children in Kent or Carlisle. May says the UK will replace EU structural funds with something better. But within our United Kingdom today, great disparities exist. So a unionist government will take action to close these gaps and bring our nations and people together. Our new UK shared prosperity fund will replace ineffective EU structural funds with a new targeted scheme, whose sole purpose will be to reduce the inequalities which exist within and between the four nations of our United Kingdom. We will take back control of structural funds and use them to strengthen our union and reduce inequalities between our communities. And she accuses the SNP of wanting to keep Scotland in the common fisheries policy. Tory policy would be better for fishing communities, she says. And leaving the EU will also enable us to build a better future for our fishermen. Leaving the European Union means leaving the common fisheries policy. After Brexit, we will be responsible for the access and management of the waters where we have historically exercised sovereign control. During this campaign, the nationalists have confirmed that their policy is to take an independent Scotland straight back into full membership of the EU, and straight back into the grip of the common fisheries policy. So my clear message to voters in Scotland’s coastal communities is this – a vote for me is a vote for a better future for fishing. A vote for the SNP is a vote for the common fisheries policy. May says she wants Scotland to play a bigger part in UK life. As long as I am prime minister, I will never stand by and let our union drift apart. Too often in the past, UK governments have tended to ‘devolve and forget’. The government I lead will put that right. We will make the institutions of our United Kingdom a force for good across the whole UK. The UK government already employs more civil servants in Scotland than the Scottish government does, and Scotland makes a major contribution to the UK’s defence estate. But I want us to do more to ensure that all parts of our union, including the great cities of Scotland, can play a bigger role in our shared national life. I am ambitious for everyone in Britain, and a government for the whole UK will leave no one behind in our efforts to spread opportunity and prosperity. So we will help the Scottish economy, putting Scottish industries at the centre of our modern industrial strategy. Scotland is an economic powerhouse within our United Kingdom and I want to do all I can to help it grow and flourish. And as we develop our new trade policies, we will use the United Kingdom’s muscle to promote Scottish exports more effectively around the world. We will build on the success of the city deals which the UK government has pioneered across Scotland, to help spread prosperity further. May says Jeremy Corbyn cannot be trusted to stand up for the union. Only the Conservative and Unionist party has the strength and credibility to stand up to the nationalists and defend our United Kingdom. Jeremy Corbyn is too weak to stand up for our union, even if he wanted to. According to him, a second independence referendum would be ‘absolutely fine’. I have been clear that now is not the time for another independence referendum. This is a time to pull together, not apart. A vote for any other party is a vote to weaken our union, to weaken our negotiating hand in Europe and to put our future prosperity and security at risk. May says Britain does best when it is united. And the lesson of Britain’s history is that we all do best when we tackle challenges together, united. Theresa May is speaking now. (She is wearing a tartan jacket.) May says this is a crucial election. It is defined by one question only: who can lead us through Brexit. (Much of her speech is very similar to yesterday’s, at the UK manifesto launch.) Davidson says she has some advice for Nicola Sturgeon. The prime minister says she is a bloody difficult woman. Well, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Davidson hands over to Theresa May. Davidson says she is appealing to Labour supporters. Their party has entered a state of civil war, she says. It may find its way back, but not at this election. So in many places the Scottish Conservatives are the only party who can take on the SNP. Davidson starts by saying the Scottish Conservatives are opposed to a second independence referendum. This is what the manifesto says about this. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, opens the manifesto launch. She praises Theresa May for showing leadership. We all know leadership when we see it, she says. And we see it in May. Tory sources are saying the 10 million figure is not what they are giving for the number of pensioners who will be affected by the cut to winter fuel payments. That is the figure produced by the Resolution Foundation, which says that if Theresa May implements her manifesto commitment to restrict winter fuel payments to “the least well-off pensioners” by restricting it just to those eligible for pension credit (an assumption, but a reasonable one), then 10 million people would lose out. The Tories will “consult extensively and develop a new means test”, a source said. The source also dismissed Labour’s suggestion that pensioners will be affected by the cut this winter. The Tory winter fuel payment cut is not expected to come into force until 2020, the source said. For the record, this is what the manifesto says on this topic. Creating a sustainable elderly care system means making decisions about how the rising budget devoted to pensioners is spent, so we will target help where it is needed most. So we will look at Winter Fuel Payments, the largest benefit paid to pensioners, in this context. The benefit is paid regardless of need, giving money to wealthier pensioners when working people on lower incomes do not get similar support. So we will meanstest Winter Fuel Payments, focusing assistance on the least well-off pensioners, who are most at risk of fuel poverty. The money released will be transferred directly to health and social care, helping to provide dignity and care to the most vulnerable pensioners and reassurance to their families. We will maintain all other pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this parliament. The Conservatives have refused to clarify whether or not 10 million pensioners will lose winter fuel payments under their plans. In response to the Labour press conference, where John McDonnell challenged them to reject that figure if it is not true (see 12.02pm), they issued a press statement that does not address the issue at all. Instead a Conservative spokesman said: Every generation would pay the price if Jeremy Corbyn is put in charge of our economy and Brexit negotiations. Our long-term plan for elderly care will make the system fairer, better funded and more sustainable – helping to ensure elderly people receive the dignified and high quality care they deserve. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has described the Tory plans to make the elderly pay more for social care as “unspeakably heartless”. He said the “dementia tax” would see families forced to sell their homes after a loved one dies. The Tory manifesto pledge commits the party to get people to pay for their own care if they have combined savings and property valued at more than £100,000. If they wish to keep their home, payment can be deferred until after they die, when it will be deducted from their estate. Speaking to the Press Association, he said: The most appalling thing in the Conservative manifesto is this unspeakable dementia tax. For the first time you’ll be asked to cash-in your home when it comes to paying for your care and your treatment. And the worst thing, to my mind – let’s say you’re the wife of a husband who has to go into a nursing home because of dementia, the reality is your house, the house that you still live in, the family home, will have to be cashed in now under the Tories’ heartless dementia tax. That’s absolutely appalling. It’s a specific attack on those who end up getting dementia. If you have dementia, the Tories are coming for you. The Hollywood actor Danny DeVito has voiced his support for Jeremy Corbyn once again, the Press Association reports. DeVito, 72, backed the Labour leader last year, saying he was a “big fan” of Corbyn. Now, with the election looming, he has tweeted: Last year the actor who starred in Matilda, Twins and The War Of The Roses told the Press Association: “You guys got Jeremy. I’m a big fan of Jeremy.” Here are the main points from the Labour press conference. Labour said 10 million pensioners could lose payment worth up to £300 a year under the Tory plans to cut winter fuel payments. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said this figure was based on the assumption that the Tory plan would involve only people on pension credit still being allowed to claim. If that was not the plan, the Tories should say so, he said. The standard winter fuel payment is £200 per household, but it is £300 for a household with someone over 80. McDonnell said: Yesterday the Conservative party abandoned older people. There was a triple whammy: the tearing up of the triple lock [on pensions], the attack on the winter fuel allowance, and the plans on care costs where people could lose control of their homes. To be frank, I’m angry. I’m one of those people who have campaigned against fuel poverty for a number of years ... There are 1 million pensioners or more living in fuel poverty, 30,000 excess deaths a year in winter in this country. It looks as though the means test could hit 10 million people ... This is a savage attack on vulnerable pensioners, particularly those who are just about managing. It is disgraceful and we are calling upon the Conservative party now to withdraw it today. We will not stand by and allow our pensioners’ winter fuel allowance to be cut in this way and so many of them to be back in the situation where they have to choose whether to be in a situation where they heat or eat. Labour said pensioners would have been £330 worse off in total if pensions had been increased every year since 2010 in line with the “double lock” (the highest of earnings or inflation - the new Tory policy) not the “triple lock” (the highest of earnings, inflation or 2.5%). McDonnell defended having the winter fuel payment as a universal benefit, saying that means testing limited take-up and that wealthy pensioners who received it also paid their taxes. He claimed the Labour manifesto plans would allow the party to reverse benefit cuts. (They will, but probably not in full. See here for more detail.) Q: You have dismissed Len McCluskey’s claim that Labour may only get 200 seats. But are you concerned about making significant losses in places like Yorkshire. McDonnell says things are turning. The more people look at policies, the more they will think again. Andrew Gwynne is now winding things up. He says the Tory triple whammy on pensioners is now a big issue in the campaign. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: What do you say to pensioners who remember the IRA bombing and you might be concerned about someone, like you, who praised the role of the IRA? McDonnell says he has apologised for those words. But he has also said that no cause is worth a life. Everything he did was about securing peace. He says MPs like him later discovered that the government was talking to the IRA in secret. Q: In the past you said you would wade through vomit to vote against benefit cuts. But Labour is planning to scrap tuition fees, helping middle class students, but not to reverse all benefit cuts. McDonnell says Labour has committed money to reverse benefit cuts. Q: Are you saying pensioners will die because of the winter fuel payments cut? McDonnell says he does not want pensioners to be cold this winter. He appeals to the Tories to withdraw it today. It is a bad policy. Q: Even though some of your policies are popular, you are still well behind. What will you do in the next few weeks to change that? McDonnell says there has been a shift in the polls. He thinks there is an underlying subterranean move. People are beginning to look at policies. He says Theresa May should debate with Jeremy Corbyn live on TV. He says one thing May and him have in common is that they do not trust Philip Hammond. Q: Are you saying pension credit has not worked? That is means tested. McDonnell conceded it has. It was introduced by Labour. But means testing has drawbacks. The last Labour government was “terrific” in terms of lifting pensioners and children out of poverty, he says. Q: Why do you need the winter fuel payment? And what do you spend it on? McDonnell says he spends it on winter fuel. If it were means tested, people would not claim. And administering a means-tested benefit would be more expensive, he says. Q: I met a voter worried about the Tory plans but intending to vote Tory because they are worried about Jeremy Corbyn. What would you say to that person? McDonnell says the person should look carefully at what is on offer. He says Corbyn is a politician who is honest and decent and open. Q: Why are you saying that 10 million pensioners will be affected? The Tories have not confirmed that. McDonnell says he was using the Resolution Foundation figure. If the Tories want to raise something in the region of £1.4bn, they need to restrict winter fuel payments to those on pension credit. He says if that is not the Tory plan, they must say so. Q: What does it say about Labour that people feel you have to cost everything, and that the Tories don’t? McDonnell says it is outrageous that Labour produces a costed manifesto, but the Tories don’t. He says Labour will issue journalists with 30 questions to ask the Tories. We will measure journalists’ productivity by how many they ask, he says. Some of these questions are serious. Pensioners are under threat. He says it is innovative for Labour to lay out information like this. Labour asked for access to the Office for Budget Responsibility and to Treasury models, he says. Q: What is Labour’s position on Heathrow? McDonnell says Labour supports Heathrow expansion, subject to strict conditions on pollution being met. He says he is the constituency MP. He is opposed to expansion, because he does not think those conditions will be met. And constituency MPs are allowed to take up constituency interests. They are now taking question. Q: Why should Mick Jagger or Alan Sugar get £300 a year from the taxpayer [in the form of the winter fuel allowance]? McDonnell says the whole point of having a non-means-tested benefit is that means testing has a deterrent effect: people do not claim. The pension credit form is 19 pages long. And people with higher incomes pay their taxes. He says this policy is putting pensioners at risk. That is why Labour is demanding that the Tories withdraw the plan. Q: You have not mentioned Tory plans for immigration. Is that because Labour would not reduce it? McDonnell says the Tories have published a manifesto with 60 uncosted pledges. Labour did publish costings. The Tory migration pledge has been in two manifestos, and it has not been met. Last night the defence secretary Michael Fallon fell apart when asked how much the policy would cost. It has been estimated it could cost £4bn to £6bn a year, he says. John McDonnell is speaking now. According to the OECD, the UK is the only major economy where growth has returned, but wages have fallen. Under the Tories, working families are paying more in tax, he says. He says there are net tax rises of £14.4bn in the pipeline between now and 2021-22. That is equivalent to £760 per family, he says. It would take the tax burden to its highest level since the 1980s. He says the Tories have increased pressure on families before, and will do so again. The UK is set to experience the worst decade in household incomes since 1949. He says the choice at the election is clear: a threat to pensioners and living standards, or a Labour plan that will protect working people. He says the Tories abandoned older people yesterday. They suffered a triple whammy: the ending of the triple lock on pensions, the winter fuel payment cuts, and the extra social care costs. He says it looks as if 10 million people will be hit. And, if only those on pension credit get the winter fuel payment, many people will lose out because a third of people eligible for credit do not claim it. We should be able to keep pensioners warm in the winter, he says. Here is Labour’s new poster. Rebecca Long-Bailey is speaking now. She says the Tories have launched an all-out attack on pensioner living standards. They are turning their backs on working people, on people who worked hard. Pensions must feel as if they’ve been kicked in the teeth. She says the Tory message is work for longer, and do not expect any help in old age. Theresa May said she would end the pursuit of selfish individualism, Long-Bailey says. She says May used to support the triple lock. Under the Tories, after 2020, the state pension will be raised annually in line with the highest of pay or earnings, not pay, earnings or 2.5%. But the Tory record on pay has been very poor. She says Labour are publishing figures showing that, if the double lock had been in place since 2010, not the triple lock, pensioners would have lost £330 in total. That is why Labour is promising to keep the triple lock, she says. She says the Resolution Foundation says 10m pensioners are at risk of losing their winter fuel payment, worth up to £300. This cut is nothing more than an attack on pensioners, she says. She says Labour introduced winter fuel payments. They worked. And, on the state pension age, she says the manifesto suggests the Tories will adopt the conclusions of the Cridland review, that proposed increasing the state pension age in line with rising life expectancy. But Labour would keep the state pension age at 66. It would then review pension policy, with a view to looking at the case of introducing a flexible pension age. Labour is holding a press conference about the Tory manifesto. Andrew Gwynne, the election coordinator, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, are speaking. McDonnell says the Tory manifesto promises more of the same. It fails working people, and especially pensioners. It dropped the triple lock on pensions, dropped the tax lock, and dropped the commitment to raise living standards. There is not a single reference to living standards in the manifesto. There is a “clear and unambiguous threat to living standards” from the Tories, he says. The Scottish National party has got its retaliation against its Conservative rivals in first by publishing a list of a “dirty dozen” policies that Theresa May has to justify. Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, singled out “punitive cuts to disability cuts”, freezing working-age benefits, the “rape clause” and two-child cap for child tax credits, the bedroom tax restriction in housing benefit, ending the triple lock on pensions, taking Scotland out of the EU single market, renewing the Trident nuclear missile system and introducing an “arbitrary” target for net migration. Sturgeon said: Theresa May needs to explain today why, under her government, inequality is set to rise at its fastest level since the 1980s. The Tory campaign in Scotland is silent about their cuts to family incomes, cuts to public services and the number of children who will have to grow up in poverty if the Tories get their way. The SNP sees the Scottish Conservatives as their main opposition in this election, in part due to the near doubling in support for the Tories under their Scottish leader, Ruth Davidson, to as high as 33% in one poll. The Tories are targeting SNP seats, several of which are vulnerable. The Tories are widely expected to win the snap election, and any opposition needs to attack the dominant party. However, the SNP also needs to leverage the Tory surge to cement its position among Scotland’s anti-Tory voters at the expense of Labour, particularly in urban constituencies. Here are the main points from John Humphrys’ interview with Ken Clarke, the former Conservative chancellor, on Today earlier. Clarke said that Theresa May “agrees with [him]” on economic policy. Given that some Tories view Clarke as well to the left of Ed Miliband or Ed Balls, this is probably not an endorsement she will welcome. He said: I think she agrees with me on economic policy - free market economics, with a social conscience ... She is not Margaret Thatcher. She is a very mainstream Conservative. She has never been on the hard right. She’s probably not quite as one nation as I am. What she’s got is intelligent common sense, and, boy is she going to need it. He said he favoured the introduction of identity cards to help control immigration. Saying that he accepted the need to tighten immigration controls, he said: I have always thought that we need identity cards to try to control at all the system. We are one of the few countries in the developed world that doesn’t have an identity card, so no one can be immediately required to demonstrate who they are. That’s absurd. He said a control like Britain needed “tough immigration controls” combined with a policy that allowed workers to come and go. Immigration is a serious subject. You do need, in today’s world, tough immigration controls that do control who comes and the numbers, combined with an understanding that if we are to have a modern, developed economy, 30-year-olds in this country will go and work in Berlin for a bit of their careers and come back again and all the rest of it. He claimed that leaving the EU would not make “the faintest difference” to whether or not the government managed to get annual net migration below 100,000. That was because the UK had always adopted a relaxed version of freedom of movement, he claimed. We always ran a rather looser version of free movement of labour than some of the other member states. We could have been been tighter if we wanted to be. He mocked John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, for wanting to ensure that pensions like him continued to get winter fuel payments. Nice of of John McDonnell to want to look after my capital and to save you and me [John Humphrys], because you draw your pension as I do now, on top of your salary - apparently we’re going to suffer fuel poverty, says John, because we’re losing our winter fuel payments. I don’t think we will He said he was “delighted” the Conservative manifesto was not costed because making firm commitments on tax and spending was a mistake. He said: Ever since that crazy manifesto that somebody put out at Conservative headquarters last time, we appear now to have a debate that all the budgets for the next four years, and every public policy you want, should be constrained in detail in what I think you’ll agree is the rather mad atmosphere of an election campaign. Having a costed manifesto would limit what a government could do, he said. Certainly not. If I was chancellor of the exchequer in say three or four years’ time, which certainly I won’t be, the idea that I have to go to the manifesto to see what the budget is going to have in it is crazy, because we don’t know what circumstances you face. He said that when he was chancellor someone had said the government would always lower taxes. “That would have been crazy,” he said. He said sometimes taxes could go down, and sometimes they had to go up. The Scottish Tories want an exclusion from Theresa May’s plans to means test winter fuel payments, in the first sign of policy differences emerging between the UK and Scottish parties as Ruth Davidson prepares to launch her party’s Scottish election manifesto in Edinburgh. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, who is defending a slender 798 majority over the Scottish National party in the rural seat of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, said restricting access to the £300-a-year benefit was difficult in Scotland because of its harsher winters and greater reliance on costly heating fuel in rural areas. He told the Herald political editor, Mike Settle, he wanted it to remain a universal benefit: The specific view in relation to Scotland is that, obviously we have different climatic issues and we have a different geography and there are far more people off-grid, who receive their fuel from not the gas or electricity grid but in terms of liquid gas, for example. Adopting different policy approaches could prove tricky for English and Welsh Tory MPs anxious to protect their support among older voters, particularly in northern England. Mundell claimed May would accept the need for different approaches: “That’s devolution,” he said. I will post a summary of the Ken Clarke interview in a moment. He was speaking to John Humphrys at Nottingham University, from where Humphrys was co-presenting the programme. Labour has attacked the Conservatives for not providing costings for their manifesto promises. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, published a list of around 60 uncosted Tory promises yesterday, and this morning he was on the Today programme making the same point. See 8.19am. Last night on Newsnight, Evan Davis asked Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, about the missing costings. He did not get very far. ED: The costings document that sets out the costs and whether it’s all going to work, is that coming later, or did I miss it, or is it online somewhere? MF: No, you haven’t missed it. Some of these things, of course, will depend on, we will consult on the level of the means test by which wealthier people will be asked to surrender the winter fuel allowance. Some of the detail is still to be consulted on, as you would expect. Davis also got Fallon to admit that the Tories have not produced any estimate of the cost to the economy of their pledge to get annual net migration below 100,000. Here is the key exchange. ED: How much is it going to cost the exchequer to get immigration down by two thirds from its current level? MF: We haven’t set out the formulation of how much it will reduce by each year. What we set out is our ambition to continue to bear down on ... ED: Have you costed that proposal? You blame Labour for not costing all theirs. Now have you costed that proposal? Because the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] says it will cost money. MF: Well, you need to cost proposals where you need to spent billions of pounds in implementing it. ED: But this is going to cost billions of pounds. MF: It isn’t going to cost billions of pounds. ED: But that’s what the OBR says. How do you know it’s not if you haven’t costed it? MF: The OBR doesn’t say it’s going to cost billions of pounds, with the greatest of respect … ED: The OBR models different migration scenarios. And there are billions of pounds of national income difference between those models, and that translates into billions of pounds of exchequer difference between those different migration assumptions. I put it again to you: have you costed the proposal to get immigration down by two thirds from its current level? MF: No, we’ve not costed, because we don’t know specifically what year we’re going to reach that point of reducing to exactly tens of thousands. Fallon was also reluctant to describe cutting annual net migration to below 100,000 as “a policy”. He preferred to describe it as “an ambition”. You can watch the full interview here. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, is on the Today programme now. He says he is delighted that the Tory manifesto is not costed. If you adopt that policy, governments get constrained. He says it would be “crazy” for a chancellor to have to consult the manifesto to see what should be in his budget. He says he thinks Theresa May’s approach to politics is the same as his – responsible economics with a social conscience. Q: Calling Theresa May a “bloody difficult woman” does not seem to have done her any harm. Clarke said that reference came from something he said to Sir Malcolm Rifkind. He told Rifkind that although May was difficult, he would be voting for her. I will post more from the interview soon. Good morning. I’m taking over from Claire. Here is some Twitter comment on the John McDonnell interview. From the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope From Total Politics’s David Singleton From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman Andrew Sparrow is now taking the blog for the rest of the Friday action. If you’d like the Snap, our daily election briefing, to arrive in your email inbox on Monday, and every weekday until whenever this is all over, do sign up here. McDonnell calls the Tory (re)commitment to cutting net migration to the tens of thousands “a joke”. And reminded of Len McCluskey’s remarks that 200 seats for Labour would be a success, McDonnell says he’s more optimistic: We’re going to win. We’re rising in the polls and now that people have seen this Tory manifesto … people are going to be angry. McDonnell says the Tory social care plans are “a complete lottery”. This is not a long-term solution. What we should be doing is going back to the Dilnot consultation. He says not having a cap on care costs puts at risk those with illnesses such as dementia: You lose, basically, control of your home. This is no solution. He says the risk needs to be “pooled across society”: It’s about universalism … that’s the basis upon which we’ve created our welfare state. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is on the Today programme to talk about the Conservative manifesto, which Labour has dubbed an “84-page blank cheque” due to its lack of detail on costings. McDonnell says voters expect to see the costs as well as the manifestos. Labour has been criticised in the past for not doing that. This week I did that. He says people might not have agreed with the policies, but the detail was there. Not so for the Tories, he says: We’ve had a manifesto laid out: 60 uncosted commitments. Taxes could go up under a new Conservative government, he says. He cites the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance, saying it’s not clear who will still get it: That means 10 million pensioners are waking up this morning to news they could lose their winter fuel allowance. They want to raise a significant sum … People on pensioner credits are some of the poorest in our society. He calls the move “sick and sneaky”, and says many pensioners live in poverty. They have not said where the means test will lie. The British economy will need a net inward migration flow of 200,000 a year, double the government target, if it is to avoid “catastrophic economic consequences”, a study by the employer backed thinktank Global Future claims today. The Tories recommitted themselves in their manifesto to a target of limiting net migration to tens of thousands, promising to double the cost to an employer of hiring a skilled immigrant worker, a move that has led to an outcry from business. As home secretary, Theresa May repeatedly missed the target, but it is now the symbol of a government commitment to meet the public’s desire to reduce immigration, the single biggest driving force behind last year’s vote to leave the European Union. The Global Future report says the UK’s low productivity, ageing population and already identifiable labour shortages in key areas, such as the NHS, show that net migration of 200,000 will be needed annually. The report, backed by three employers’ groups, criticises both main parties for refusing to be honest with the British public about the level of migration the UK requires, warning that if the UK refuses to be flexible about its sources of labour, it faces a potential decade of slow growth similar to the Japanese economy. The Scottish Green leader has urged supporters to consider a tactical vote for Labour or the Liberal Democrats if their candidates have a better chance of stopping the Tories. Patrick Harvie said he regretted that the Scottish Greens were only able to stand three candidates in the general election, but said a shortage of time and money meant the party had to focus on only a handful of Scotland’s 59 Commons constituencies. Implying that Green voters should set aside the party’s quest for Scottish independence at this election, Harvie told the Guardian blocking the Tories should be a priority for his party’s supporters, many of whom would feel an affinity with the pro-independence Scottish National party. “The idea that you’re focused on the need to advance Green politics but also oppose the Tory government doesn’t always lead you in one political direction,” Harvie said, in an effort to fend off allegations from opponents that his party is standing aside in 56 seats to bolster the SNP. “There will be some parts of the country where Green voters will be tempted to vote SNP if there’s no Green candidate; there will be other parts of the country where Green voters might be tempted to vote Lib Dem or Labour.” Harvie, co-convenor of the Scottish Greens, is standing for Westminster for the first time in Glasgow North, a seat held by the SNP’s Patrick Grady, after the area had the highest Scottish Green vote in the council elections this month. “If I thought Glasgow North might fall to the Tories I would’ve stopped to think very hard [about standing], but I’m convinced that it won’t,” he said, before recommending Green voters also consider backing Scotland’s only Labour MP, Ian Murray, in Edinburgh South. “If I was in Ian Murray’s constituency the question would be very different because he’s clearly very capable of beating the Tories.” The absence of Theresa May from last night’s rest-of-the-leaders-apart-from-Corbyn-as-well debate was a key theme among the party leaders who did pitch up. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood (not Natalie, as Ukip’s Paul Nuttall twice called her) said the PM was “too scared to come here tonight for your U-turns to be highlighted, for your cruel policies to be exposed”, calling it “weak and unstable leadership”. (You’ll all see what she did there.) Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said May’s decision not to attend was proof she was taking the electorate for granted: She thinks she owns this result. She thinks she owns our country, owns our future and owns our children’s future. Sturgeon echoed Wood’s comments, but with a dig at the Conservative-Ukip détente, saying May: did not have the guts to be here tonight but her spokesman in the form of Paul Nuttall is here in her place. Next Monday is the deadline to register, and you must be registered to have a vote in the 8 June election. You can register at gov.uk/register-to-vote, which requires you to answer 11 questions including name, address, national insurance number and whether you want a postal vote. The deadline is midnight on 22 May. To register you must be a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen resident in the UK, or a UK citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years. If you are a student you may be able to register to vote at both your home and term-time addresses, but remember that it is illegal to vote more than once. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative incumbent standing again in Totnes and a former GP, has written for the Times today about her party’s social care proposals. She is not entirely won over: Any policy must avoid unintended consequences and ministers will need to clarify what period of grace will be applied for those who may only need short periods of care. This so-called ‘disregard’ is set at 12 weeks for those needing residential care and it is essential that this also applies to home care. If not, it will exacerbate rather than reduce delays to hospital discharges. The dropping of the care cap sadly leaves social care uninsurable, leaving in place the miserable lottery of care costs. A future government should at least look again at supporting state-backed insurance for those who have not yet reached retirement age, so that they can begin to protect against this. The case for insurance was also pressed yesterday by Sir Andrew Dilnot, who led a government review into the funding of social care in 2011. He said the Tory manifesto “shows a less than full understanding of the problems”. The Conservative campaign so far has not exactly been characterised by its openness – now Scottish political journalists aren’t entirely sure where this morning’s manifesto launch will be happening: The Scottish Conservatives will be the first party in Scotland to unveil their general election manifesto, with an event in Edinburgh where party leader Ruth Davidson will make a direct pitch to Labour voters to switch sides at this election. Labour, the Scottish National party, Greens and Lib Dems will follow on from Monday next week. Davidson, who as Holyrood Tory leader is not standing for election to Westminster, will seize on the fact Scotland was the only Labour region that voted against Jeremy Corbyn in the last UK leadership election. She will focus on a recent battle between Aberdeen city councillors and the party’s Scottish executive over the councillors’ controversial decision to agree a coalition deal with the Conservatives against the orders of party leaders. Latching on to the apparently centrist elements of Theresa May’s UK Conservative manifesto on workers rights and pay, and buoyed by opinion polls putting the Tories 10 to 15 points ahead of Labour in Scotland, Davidson will say: The truth is, your party has left you, not the other way around. And it may well find its way back. But you know – and I know – it won’t be at this election. Pitching to unionist, working-class voters, she will add: We are committed to workers’ rights, boosting low pay, getting a good deal for our fishermen and improving the education of our young people so cruelly let down by this Scottish government. Together, with your help, we can lead the fightback against the SNP and stop Nicola Sturgeon trying to pull our country apart. Despite these bravura words, Davidson’s party is quite unlikely to make a breakthrough in inner-city areas of Scotland rather the Tory-leaning shires and Highlands. The SNP’s grip on urban seats is too great, with only the well-heeled suburban seat of East Renfrewshire a possible gain in an urban area. Welcome back to the morning after the leaders’ debate that wasn’t. I’m Claire Phipps to help you catch your breath with your morning roundup before we plunge back into the campaign depths. Do join in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. What’s happening? Tim Farron is from Preston; Leanne Wood is not – despite the insistence of Paul Nuttall – called Natalie; Nicola Sturgeon is the self-styled leader of the resistance; Caroline Lucas might have been the winner; and the absence of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn didn’t stop Conservative and Labour HQs snarking about each other on Twitter. Is that all we learned from last night’s ITV leader-lite leader’s debate? Yes. If by any chance you’d like to relive it, our live blog, complete with Andrew Sparrow’s wearied conclusion, is right here. If the twin themes of the debate were Brexit and May taking her election win (and voters) for granted, they are themes that the day leading up to the debate did little to unseat. “At last, a PM not afraid to be honest with you,” is the Daily Mail’s cod liver oily headline this morning in response to a manifesto assembled by people seemingly confident that they could unveil an adult colouring book and not slip below a 12-point lead. “There is no Mayism,” May said at the launch, “only good solid Conservatism”, a less is more approach that stretched from the policy-light manifesto to the PM’s decision not to trouble herself with televised debates. (She prefers door-knocking, which might, it turns out, reach a not dissimilar number of people to last night’s ITV viewing figures.) The prime minister vowed to be “upfront and straight” as she announced plans for elderly people to fund their own social care, the means-testing of winter fuel payments, and the downgrading of the pensions triple lock – scolded as a “nasty party triple whammy” by Corbyn. Foxhunting and selective schools make it in. Out would go the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (already mortally wounded by the fact we’re enduring an election campaign right now), Leveson part two and the “tax lock” pledge not to raise national insurance or income tax. The single market and the customs union: also so over. You can read more on all the key points here, along with how it differs from David Cameron’s 2015 to-do list here. What you can’t read is the numbers. There were a few dabbed here and there: £4bn for schools (though £2.8bn of that is to cover rising pupil numbers); another £8bn a year for the NHS (not enough, say experts). But having derided Labour over its spending plans, the Tories decided to outsmart the nitpickers by simply not bothering to show its own costings, prompting Labour to label it an “84-page blank cheque”. Interviewed on BBC Newsnight on Thursday, defence secretary Michael Fallon conceded that even the policy – though the Tories are now calling it merely an “ambition”, despite copying and pasting it into the manifesto for the third time – to slash net migration had not been costed, “because we don’t know specifically what year we’re going to reach that point of reducing to exactly tens of thousands”. Perhaps that immigration policy is now so old it can pay for its own care. Today, May will not be knocking on individual voters’ doors to show them her scribbled sums because it’s the turn of the Scottish Conservatives to give their manifesto an airing. That curbing of winter fuel payments might not make it into this version; the block on another independence referendum before Brexit will. At a glance: The Guardian view on Theresa May’s manifesto: a new Toryism. Tories receive £50,000 from donor questioned by Serious Fraud Office. National Grid boss say Labour plan will stall green energy drive. Scottish Greens urge tactical voting to block Conservatives. Gina Miller targets voters with tailored Facebook ads. Poll position Perhaps voters really do pay attention to manifestos: an Ipsos Mori telephone poll for the Evening Standard, conducted after Labour set out its plans, pushed the party up eight points from last month to 34%, a campaign high. The Tories held steady at 49%, paring their lead from 23 to – I can’t really justify an “only” here – 15 points. The Lib Dems slithered from 13% in April to just 7%; the Greens (+2 to 3%) vaulted Ukip (-2 to 2%). Diary This morning we’ll have the Scottish Conservative manifesto from Ruth Davidson in Edinburgh. John McDonnell and Rebecca Long-Bailey will deliver Labour’s response to the overall Conservative plans. At noon, in Anglesey, Leanne Wood sets out Plaid Cymru’s ideas for a post-Brexit Wales. Tim Farron is out and about in Cheshire. Read these Lucky Marina Hyde was in the leaders’ debate spin room: Ukip always bring along a full nest of spinners: couple of sharp suits, a few local heavies, and one guy who looks like he might ask you to help him lift a sofa into the back of a van. ‘It would have been better if the other four had just agreed everything beforehand and just one of them had debated Paul,’ one explained. But another thought it couldn’t have gone better, ‘and he looks the part’. Does he? Paul Nuttall has two political outfits: one, the dark suit, which makes him look like the sort of passively-aggressed employee whose boss greets him daily with the words, ‘What you doing in that daft suit, Paul? You in court or something?’ And two, the tweed-on-tweed, which makes him look like the efit of a man wanted in connection with a roofing scam. Isabel Hardman, in the Spectator, says – for different reasons – that Corbyn was right not to attend the debate: I suspect for Corbyn, the decision not to go near this opposition-focused debate has much more to do with his own belief that this election should be fought on normal terms (ie, that Labour might win) … Corbyn may also have found it rather uncomfortable being ganged up on from the left by Caroline Lucas, Nicola Sturgeon and Leanne Wood, who gave the altogether more professional Ed Miliband a hard time in 2015. They might have asked him why he abandoned the principles of unilateral nuclear disarmament, for instance. Revelation of the day Just as interesting – OK, interesting might be a stretch – as what’s included in a party manifesto is what it leaves out. So what won’t be going “Forward, Together” with Team Theresa May? Air pollution doesn’t get a mention. On new nuclear power stations, a staple of previous Tory policy, not a murmur. Rail fares? Not stopping at this station. Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen: nothing to see here. And to anyone still holding out for that £350m a week extra for the NHS, I hate to break it to you… The day in a tweet exchange And another thing Would you like to wake up to this briefing in your inbox every weekday?

It is not far from the centre of the granite city to the poorer wards, though, where like so many places, people struggling to pay ever-increasing energy bills are still forced to live in cold, damp, poorly insulated homes. It seems incongruous then that in the last parliament the government gave the oil and gas industry billions of pounds in tax breaks and subsidies, while it spent barely £400m making buildings more energy efficient. Some argue it is particularly odd in light of the UK’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions by 80% by the middle of this century. This pursuit of what some would see as growth at all costs is rooted in centuries of Treasury control of Whitehall, not just as a necessarily cautious finance ministry but the hub of economic strategy, too. Critics denounce its often secretive and some say arrogant culture, as well as its unabashed free-market, conservative, short-term growth agenda. Some also suspect there is an ambivalence or even denial of climate change feeding down from the top that infuses the department’s attitude to measures that would tackle climate change. The Treasury has tried to water down carbon reduction targets, given the go ahead to new airports, announced a boom in road building, cut fuel duty, frozen – and is now cutting – support for renewable energy, and even blocked research into the impacts of climate change on the UK economy. The Treasury stamp runs through government. When David Cameron walked back into No 10 Downing Street on 8 May he did not pass a plaque announcing the official residence of the prime minister, but his other title: first lord of the Treasury. His government sits on the Treasury benches in the House of Commons. These are not historical curiosities: they reveal much about where power lies in the British establishment. The department has gradually accumulated more power since swallowing up the then separate Department of Economic Affairs in 1969 – which had been set up five years earlier by Harold Wilson to split finance and economic policy. The trend from annual to three-year budget planning has given the chancellor an even greater say in strategic decisions made by cabinet colleagues. And now the Treasury must approve spending over £100m – a lot of money to ordinary people but “in the weeds” for significant public policy, says one former mandarin, especially any measure that would have an impact on the energy revolution required to decarbonise the economy. No one would question that the finance ministry has a duty to ensure public money is spent wisely. But critics have long accused the Treasury of using these powers to choke off ideas it does not like. Across Whitehall, civil servants or ministers have only to suggest the Treasury will not like a policy to shut down discussion. And it is not just the inevitable instinct to say no to spending, but the barriers put up to debate: an ex-Treasury economist describes how civil servants two grades below the requested level would be sent into meetings to say no, to make futile any attempt to negotiate the refusal. Even within the department, civil servants are seldom in a position to challenge what is going on. The Sharon White report on the Treasury [pdf] after the 2008 crisis found staff churn was the highest in Whitehall, employees were younger than any other department and too generalist. “It’s not a department that likes intellectual challenge,” reports a former insider. “It’s completely at odds with how it expresses itself: Osborne-Macpherson thought is all you can think.” Some would argue that the Treasury, in favouring the fossil fuel industry, is just doing its job of maximising tax revenues. There is tangible public hunger to tax big corporations, and oil and gas companies do pay a lot of tax: their corporation tax made up nearly a 10th (£4.7bn) of the national total last year. As demands for public spending escalate, the Treasury cannot afford to choke off such an important source. This presumably is the thinking behind what are already £1.3bn of tax breaks and subsidies a year, and as forecasts show the wells of black gold in the North Sea are drying up fast the chancellor announced new exemptions of more than £200m a year in his March budget to encourage exploration. What makes the Treasury obsession with reducing spending and raising tax so distorting, however, is not just that it has a pervasive influence across government, but there is no counter-weight. The UK is not unique in combining the finance and economics functions of government, but there are tensions: “No company has accountants running [their] forward investment strategy,” is how one former adviser put it. This stress in the system is almost certainly exacerbated by the historical imbalance of the two roles: the Treasury has been balancing the books for centuries; it has been responsible for economics for a few decades. It is one way of explaining why – to the immense frustration of those making the case for low-carbon infrastructure – the green investment bank, set up in 2012 to fund environmentally friendly infrastructure, was forbidden from borrowing to lend, notably limiting its impact. More wealth, and now Just a few weeks after coming to power in 2010, the new Tory chancellor stood, grim faced, outside No 11 Downing Street, on his way to the House of Commons for the coalition’s “emergency budget”. By tradition he held aloft the red box for the press cameras. But this was not the red box of modern chancellors, it was the more famous battered leather-bound and silk-lined (deeper red) red box first used by William Gladstone in 1860. Osborne had to negotiate hard with the reluctant National Archives to borrow the frail relic, and his insistence set the tone for the next five years. The 19th-century Liberal is a sort of father of the modern Treasury – not just through his extension of Treasury control, but his economic vision. Beneath a portrait in his study of Gladstone – patrician, cold-eyed, with his distinctive downturned mouth – Osborne perhaps prepared a speech he gave in January this year on economic policy for the next parliament and beyond, declaring his goal “for Britain to become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s, with that prosperity widely shared across our country”. To the extent that there is an economic agenda, that is it: growth. Few would advocate a contracting economy, but this is not a vision for long-term sustainable growth, it is simply a desire for more wealth, and now. In practice, when assessing competing projects, the Treasury’s Green Book rules give every impression that economic growth trumps all other considerations: “The economic case is the essential core of the business case”, it stipulates, before adding “it is important to ensure that the proposal has considered any relevant wider issues [including] environmental and sustainability”. In this atmosphere it is less surprising that in 2015 the Highways Agency, basically a conduit for Treasury spending on major roads, has just two environmental key performance indicators: biodiversity and noise. No mention of carbon emissions, despite road traffic accounting for a fifth of the UK’s output. The Green Book says any policy decision must consider alternatives, including “do nothing”. But spending nothing does not deliver the quick-fix growth ministers want. Encouraging producers to use less packaging and consumers to waste less will not win a competition with building an expensive incinerator. Reducing energy used by buildings will not stand a chance against the jobs and investment of a multibillion pound nuclear power plant. Delivering this growth is a strategy that (its critic) John Maynard Keynes called the “Treasury view”. The approach has evolved since Gladstone’s day, but the “Treasury view for our time”, described last year in a speech by the department’s permanent secretary and top civil servant Sir Nicholas Macpherson, is aggressively free-trade and free-market, pro-deregulation and competition. “Markets generally work,” declared Macpherson, advocating the state only intervene after things go wrong. Among his more controversial suggestions were the virtue of cheap food, and that “the lesson of the financial crisis is not that we had too much competition but that we did not have enough”. Evidence of this philosophy is everywhere in the failure of environment policy, not just the past five years, but under the last government too. For years the Treasury has ignored repeated pleading for subsidies to encourage people to make homes more efficient, arguing the advantages are so obvious they will do so anyway (despite a decade of evidence that people don’t), based on the prevalent belief in efficient markets of rational individuals. This short-term growth driven, free-market, rational framework then necessarily shapes the models that the Treasury has designed to assess spending decisions across government. But unconsciously or otherwise they appear to have produced some questionable assumptions fed into those models. The government’s own aviation commission has stopped using its official oil price forecasts, worrying they are too low and flatter future demand for air travel – an issue that must then exist for road transport and other policies too. The cross-party environment select committee has criticised the “discount” rate used to calculate the benefits of a policy years ahead, undervaluing those future advantages. Many other assumptions have to be made – the risk of “optimism bias”, or the value of time saved by cutting congestion. In other cases things are simply not counted at all: while models put the cost of low-carbon policies in the negative column, there is no counting the benefits of avoided damage in the positive one. Climate change ambivalence The institutional bias of the Treasury is clearly strong. But it is striking that as the science of global warming has got more certain, the climate change warnings more dire, and the political promises more ambitious, there has been no evident attempt to challenge this culture, under Labour or Conservative chancellors. The chancellors and mandarins have necessarily been preoccupied with urgent problems in the past seven years: collapsing banks, currencies and productivity. Critics also mumble that some senior figures are at best ambivalent about climate change, possibly unconvinced it is a threat. But a third theory was (implicity) suggested by Osborne himself: that the Treasury remains unconvinced the UN-led process to agree international carbon cuts will work. Early in his tenure the chancellor railed against the “burden” and “ridiculous cost” of green policies, from the UK and the European Union. “I don’t want us to be the only people out there in front of the rest of the world,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2016/mar/01/bournemouth-southampton-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-01T21:45:30Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth 2-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/mar/01/bournemouth-southampton-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2016/mar/01/bournemouth-southampton-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth 2-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s that! Bournemouth claim three richly deserved points - and their first league win over Southampton since 1958! Saints didn’t really turn up tonight, but put that down to the Cherries playing a hard game from front to back. They pinged the ball around nicely as usual, but tonight was about hunting in packs, defending well, and taking their chances from set pieces. They’re now eight clear of the relegation zone, and survival in their first top-flight season is very much on the cards! 90 min +3: Bertrand earns a corner for Saints down the left. Ward-Prowse takes, but Boruc snaffles confidently. That should be that. 90 min +2: Gosling has a shot from 25 yards. It flies 25 yards into the sky. 90 min +1: Smith goes on a romp down the left. His cross flies straight through the Saints area, but is fetched by Ritchie on the other flank. The clock’s whizzing by for the home side right now. 90 min: There will be four added minutes. A ripple of anxiety around Dean Court. The home crowd know how important these three points will be in the context of their battle to stay in the division. 89 min: Ritchie heads into space down the right, sending Grabban scuttling off to the corner. Time is Bournemouth’s friend now, and well they know it. 87 min: So having said all that, Saints naturally muster their first shot on target. Romeu flicks down the inside-right channel to release Mane into the area. Boruc comes off his line to smother at the striker’s feet. That was a brilliant save from a goalkeeper who has had nothing to do all evening. 85 min: Pugh comes on for Gradel. Grabban has a dig from 25 yards out on the left, straight at Forester. A general sense that this game is over: Saints have been low on energy for most of the evening, and they’re looking particularly kaput right now. 83 min: Replays of the free kick that led to Bournemouth’s second suggest it was a generous decision: Van Dijk had simply risen higher to win a header, and Afobe went down easily. Then again, Saints didn’t bother to defend the free kick properly - serious questions will be asked of both Forster, who froze on his line, and Van Dijk, who let Afobe swan in front of him - so there’s only so much sympathy available. 81 min: Afobe is sent scampering after a long ball down the right. He earns Bournemouth’s 984th corner of the evening. This one’s sent long to the far post, where Francis is penalised for pushing. Saints look seriously deflated after that goal. This is as simple as it comes. A free kick for the hosts out on the right touchline, Van Dijk having nudged Afobe as the pair rise for a high ball. Ritchie takes the set play, whipping an inswinger into the box. Afobe makes a run ahead of five green shirts. Forster fails to come off his line, and Afobe is free to guide a simple header into the top right! 78 min: A long ball down the right wing for Mane. He’s a touch offside, Cook and Francis stepping up just in time. Just as well, because Mane crossed anyway, and his ball beat Boruc: had play continued, there’d have been a tap-in for any Saints player keeping up with play. 75 min: Cook with a full-length dive to clear with a header. Brave, as Pelle’s boot was flying around there too. Free kick, and some welcome relief for Bournemouth, who are struggling to hold onto the ball right now. 73 min: Davis, from deep, plays a long pass along the floor, down the middle of the park. Pelle, his back to goal, turns to the right and bobbles a low shot towards the bottom left from 25 yards. It’s only just wide of the left-hand post. Hearts in Bournemouth mouths there. The away side are beginning to press and probe, finally. 72 min: Tadic is immediately involved, first making a pest of himself down the left, then getting involved in a game of head tennis in the Bournemouth box. The hosts eventually batter the ball clear. This could be a long 20 minutes for the Hampshire Dorset stars, as they look to keep a hold of these precious three points. 71 min: Injuries have totally and utterly disrupted this second half. Now it’s Long’s turn to limp off looking glum. Tadic replaces him. Meanwhile King - who was up until the early hours of this morning waiting for his partner to give birth, congratulations to all - sleepwalks off. Grabban takes his place. 68 min: Space for Gradel down the left. He whistles his cross out of play on the right. It’s all very scrappy at the moment. “It can’t be Charlie Austin’s knee,” writes Dr Chris Brock, “as he doesn’t have one.” 66 min: There’s nobody near Arter, but he lands awkwardly and instantly signals to the bench to be substituted. Looks like he’s tweaked a knee if the way the physio is manipulating his leg counts for anything. Gosling comes on in his place. 63 min: Pelle’s first act is to head a long ball forward into the Saints box. Cook comes across to clear. Long, desperately trying to connect with a volley, merely kicks his opponent. A proper playground hoof on the shin, and a no-brainer of a free kick to Bournemouth. Both players roll about in agony, though they’re soon up and about. On the touchline, Ronaldo Koeman ludicrously argues with the new fourth official, demanding a penalty! No, I don’t think so, sir. By the way, on the subject of the fourth official, the departed and hospitalised Friend did faint before crashing into the dugout, though word is he’s now feeling OK, if a little bruised and battered. 60 min: Austin looks to have tweaked something. Knee? Hamstring? Dr Murray is an ignorant old quack, but he can report that Austin is limping off. Pelle, having quickly divested his vest, comes on in Austin’s stead. 58 min: It’s still tatty. Long and Davis take turns to send simple passes out of play. Saints need to step it up a bit here. They’ve not created very much, and Bournemouth are half an hour or so away from their first home win against Saints since 1958. 56 min: Gradel, down the inside-left channel, tries to slip Afobe clear on his inside. But he overhits the pass, and it goes straight through to Forster. A chance spurned. This has got a little tatty. 54 min: Surman meets a third corner in a row. This one’s a clearing header, though, as Saints win their first corner of the game, out on the right. 53 min: Afobe robs Cedric down the Bournemouth left. He slides a ball down the middle for King to chase. King’s not far from getting clear of Van Dijk, but the big defender reads it well, steps across, and sweeps clear. He’s been very impressive this evening. 51 min: Corner for Bournemouth on the left. Ritchie plays it short for Surman, who miscontrols and allows Cedric to sweep clear. But Afobe is soon coming back at the visitors, down the same wing, and that’s Bournemouth’s ninth corner of the night. (Saints haven’t had a single one.) Surman gets on the end of this one too, but it’s a directionless header, wafting up into the air, and once again Saints hoick clear. 49 min: Davis slides a ball down the right wing for Cedric, pushing him towards the corner flag. He crosses deep for Long, who tries to work a bit of space down the inside-left channel. The ball hits the striker’s arm as he shapes to shoot, and the whistle goes for hand ball. A slightly lucky bounce for Bournemouth there, as that wasn’t deliberate by the Saints man, and he was in range to trouble Boruc. 47 min: Gradel takes the free kick, and skelps it deep to King, who can’t quite keep the ball in play at the far post. On the face of it, a waste, but that was a good idea: had Gradel sent that over a bit lower, King would have been heading that back into a packed six-yard box. Bournemouth get the ball rolling for the second half. Arter chips a fine pass down the left for Daniels, who is shoved onto the floor by Mane. A free kick in a very dangerous position, and a very positive start to the half by the hosts. The second half will be delayed by five minutes or so. Kevin Friend is being taken to hospital for checks, so we’ll need a new fourth official. Dean Treleaven is here, and will take up Friend’s duties. And the half-times in the other Premier League matches: Aston Villa 0-2 Everton; Leicester City 2-1 WBA; Norwich City 0-2 Chelsea; Sunderland 1-0 Crystal Palace. Leicester keep on keepin’ on. Meanwhile Norwich are beginning to play their way into a little trouble, aren’t they. Palace need to wake up as well. This is one magnificent season. Aston Villa aside, good luck predicting what’s going to happen at either end of the table. News of Kevin Friend: According to BT Sport, the fourth official either fainted or tripped before colliding with the dugout. Ooyah. The poor chap’s cut up his face a wee bit, and is being treated by the local ambulance service. He’s conscious, but a little groggy. Get well soon. Half-time entertainment from sunny Dorset Hampshire: It’s Bournemouth in 1961. My sight’s not what it was, but is that a shop called CIGARS (38 to 50 seconds)? Marvellous. Who needs fancy branding? Mike Dean opts to blow for half time and scuttles off down the tunnel. The players follow him. A slightly surreal end to the half. 45 min +1: It’s not quite half time - seconds to go - but the referee’s stopped the game. Word is that fourth official Kevin Friend has somehow banged his head while working on the touchline. All of a sudden, a very strange, subdued atmosphere at Dean Court. Confusion more than concern is the top note right now, as it’s not totally clear what’s happened, but fingers crossed that this is nothing serious and Friend is OK. 44 min: ... the ball hits Long in the chest, six yards out. Bournemouth scream for a penalty, but they’re being cheeky buggers there. Saints can only half clear, and King earns yet another corner - Bournemouth have had about 600, the bookies will be furious - down the same flank. This one ends with Ritchie faffing around on the wing and being caught offside. 43 min: Arter embarks on a Power Dribble down the inside-right channel. He very nearly breaks into the box, but before he can find the room to shoot, Romeu takes the ball off his toe and hacks out for a corner on the right. From which ... 40 min: Austin is adjudged to have illegally barged Francis off the ball as the pair contest a long pass down the Saints inside-right channel. It looked like a fair shoulder charge, so Austin batters a wild shot into the stand behind the goal in frustration. Not sure whether the referee pedantically booked him for that - BT Sport cut away as Mike Dean was fingering his pocket with a satisfied grin playing across his boat - so let’s assume common sense won the day there, and the card remained sheathed. Smith is then hacked to the floor by Romeu in the centre circle. No booking, that I can tell you for sure, though there probably should have been. 37 min: Ward-Prowse takes an awful chance deep on the Saints right. He’s nearly swarmed by Afobe and Gradel, but manages to dribble between them. Had he been dispossessed there, Bournemouth were tearing clear on goal. 35 min: Koeman decides to make a tactical change. Off goes a sheepish Yoshida, on comes Davis. A move to bolster the midfield. Perhaps he saw that possession stat, eh. 33 min: Bournemouth come at Saints again. They have their tails up right now. Gradel shifts the ball inside from the left, sends Cedric spinning around like a teenager on Teacher’s Highland Cream. From 20-odd yards, he looks to curl one into the top-right corner. It’s not too far over the bar, a decent effort. Ritchie takes the free kick, just outside the box on the right. He lashes it into the six-yard box at mid-height, forcing a wrong-footed Forster to parry up and out, his defenders having failed to react. Cook, shaping like Mark Hughes, guides a soft volley down, up and into the unguarded right-hand portion of the net. That’s a tatty goal, but full marks to King for earning the free kick. Fonte wants to have a good think about what he’s just done. 30 min: Brilliant play by King down the right, winning a ball he should never win as Fonte tries to shepherd it out of play. King makes for the box, tries to diddle his way past Yoshida, fails, and is fouled by Fonte. Free kick in a dangerous position, though. From which ... 29 min: Francis bowls Bertrand to the floor as the Saints man makes off down the left. Saints load the box. Ward-Prowse whips fiercely along a low arc to the far post, where Boruc claims. That was a better free kick than his strikers made it look. He’s a talent with the dead ball, that lad. 27 min: Bournemouth have apparently enjoyed 89% of possession during the last five minutes. Saints have, of course, come the closest to scoring during that period. The inexorable rise of statistics, eh? Jesus wept. 26 min: King’s going nowhere down the inside-right channel, but Van Dijk helps him by shoving him needlessly in the back. A free kick, just to the right of the D. A very dangerous position. Surman nudges the ball to the left for Ritchie, who hits low and hard but straight into the Saints wall. That wasn’t particularly clever. 24 min: Austin gets the better of Francis down the left. He loops a cross into the middle for Long, who doesn’t quite connect with his header. Daniels does connect, sending the ball high into the air. Boruc does well to sprint off his line and claim before Long can have a second go. A split second later, and Long was scoring there. 22 min: Ward-Prowse clatters into the back of Arter, who lands on the meat of his buttocks. No foul is awarded, but Arter sits on the turf awhile, waving his arms in fury, as some midfield noodling is played out around his prone body. It’s quite a nice little vignette. 20 min: Daniels does incredibly well to control a fizzing pass down the left, and races along the wing. He whips into the area. A decent cross, but once again it’s Van Dijk who heads clear. He’s been on the end of just about everything so far. No wonder Celtic aren’t half as good this season. 18 min: Saints on the attack through Bertrand down the left. Long and Austin are lurking, but Francis clears. Romeu chests the clearance down, 25 yards from goal, shapes to shoot, but instead pokes a pass down the inside-left channel to release Mane into the area. Mane’s facing a tight angle, though, and belts a wild effort well over the bar. That was nice football from the visitors; a slightly better pass, and Mane was opening the scoring there. 16 min: Ritchie goes sliding in on Mane after overrunning the ball. He gets to it first, but then crumps his studs into his opponent’s boot too. You’ve seen yellow cards given for that, even if it looked clumsy and out of control rather than malicious. Mike Dean makes do with a lecture. 14 min: Bournemouth push Saints back a wee bit. Smith finds a yard or two down the right, but his looping cross, meant for King in the middle, is easily dealt with by Yoshida. 12 min: A lot of sterile possession in the midfield for Saints. Eventually Van Dijk gets fed up, and takes a couple of Beckenbaueresque strides down the inside-right channel. Eventually, he takes a shot from the best part of 40 (!) yards. It’s not a wholly realistic ambition, that, is it. And sure enough, it’s easily blocked by the nearest red-and-black shirt. 10 min: Another corner for Bournemouth! Gradel wins this one with a powerful run down the left. And then it’s corner five-and-a-half, because Gradel takes it while the ball’s rolling and has to play it again. The corner’s hit deep, but King can’t get onto Daniels’ knock-down. The ball’s recycled down the left for the busy Gradel again, but his cross into a still-crowded box doesn’t beat the first man, and Saints mop up the danger. 8 min: Gradel, making good down the inside-left channel, slides Afobe into space on the wing. Afobe earns a corner off Cedric. Once again, Van Dijk gets his nut on the set piece and sends the ball sailing clear of the danger zone. A lovely, bright, end-to-end start to this derby. Both sets of fans are still giving it plenty. 5 min: Mane finds a little space down the right. He cuts back to Ward-Prowse, whose low cross is half cleared. Another chance for Mane on the wing. He shifts the ball forward for Cedric, who reaches the byline and fizzes a low cross to Austin on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He opens his body and sidefoots strongly, albeit well wide of the right-hand post. A striker of Austin’s quality really should have hit the target there, and well he knows it, holding his head in his hands. 3 min: This is a great start by Bournemouth. First they win a corner down the left. Forster punches Gradel’s effort clear. Then Ritchie tears down the right, and earns his side’s third corner of these early exchanges. This one’s clanked clear by the head of Van Dijk. But the underdogs have come flying out of the blocks here. 59 seconds: King bursts down the right and cuts back for Arter, who blooters hard towards the bottom right. Nearly a dramatic start, but Forster saves well. The resulting corner comes to nothing. The Saints get this evening’s march underway. A thundering atmosphere at Dean Court. A long ball from deep, but Austin can’t get anywhere near it. Boruc gathers. The teams are out! A light show welcomes the players as they take to the field. Bournemouth sport their AC Milan influenced red-and-black stripes, while Southampton wear second-choice nuclear-power-plant-incident green. Meanwhile here’s Richard Hamblin, who’d like to take issue with my glib factual assertion that this game is a Dorset versus Hampshire affair. “Yeah, but historically and pretty much culturally too Bournemouth actually is Hants not Dorset,” he writes, while rhythmically thrashing me over the head with a rolled-up copy of the Local Government Act of 1972. He’s got a point, readers, as said piece of legislation concerning the reorganisation of county and district councils can confirm. Also, having spent a large proportion of my life in Basingstoke, the Dallas of England, I can confirm that being battered around the noggin is very much part of Hampshire culture, so Richard is bang on the money in all respects. And now a slightly stern Eddie Howe, in full Business Mode, no messing: “Three points tonight would be a huge step. We’re looking at home to set a real platform for the rest of the season. We haven’t been as fluent as we’d like at home, so this is a good chance to put that right. I’m sure our supporters will make tonight an atmosphere to remember. We haven’t done as well as we’d like in derbies of late, so we have it all to prove.” A very relaxed-looking Ronald Koeman speaks! “We know this is a difficult one. They are fighting against relegation, and it is always difficult to beat such clubs. We played a good game against Chelsea, even if we lost. If we make a good run of good results, we have a chance of Europe. It’s a small stadium and it will be a good atmosphere. I am looking forward!” Just the one change to the Bournemouth starting XI that earned a point at Watford last weekend. Junior Stanislas suffered a hamstring injury in that match, and he’s replaced by Max Gradel, who only returned from a long injury lay-off on Saturday himself. Still no Victor Wanyama for Saints. Bournemouth fans won’t be surprised to learn that the card-happy midfielder is serving the third game of a five-match suspension, his most recent meltdown coming against West Ham United a month ago. Ronald Koeman makes three changes to the team that went down at home to Chelsea on Saturday: Matt Targett, Jordy Clasie and Steven Davis drop to the bench, with Maya Yoshida, James Ward-Prowse and Sadio Mane stepping up. AFC Bournemouth: Boruc, Smith, Francis, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie, Surman, Arter, Gradel, Afobe, King. Subs: Gosling, Elphick, Pugh, Federici, Distin, Murray, Grabban. Southampton: Forster, van Dijk, Fonte, Yoshida, Cedric, Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Bertrand, Mane, Long, Austin. Subs: Clasie, Steven Davis, Tadic, Martina, Pelle, Stekelenburg, Targett. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). It’s never going to generate the heightened emotions of the Saints-Pompey fixture. Hey, that’s probably just as well. And in any case, a south-coast derby is a south-coast derby is a south-coast derby, and this Dorset-Hampshire brouhaha promises to be a cracker. The hosts first. And the Cherries are looking for their first home victory over Southampton since they won 2-1 in the old Third Division in October 1958. They’re also hoping to avoid defeat against Saints for the first time in the 21st century. They’ve met four times in recent years, and lost the lot: two League One fixtures in 2010/11, a League Cup tie in the same season, and a 2-0 reverse at St Mary’s last November, Steven Davis and Graziano Pelle the goalscorers in a match which also saw hot fuse Victor Wanyama sent off. It’s about time they arrested that run of defeats. Eddie Howe’s side have built a little buffer between themselves and the relegation zone. But five points won’t last forever, so a result tonight would be just the ticket. Saints meanwhile were sucker-punched by Chelsea at the weekend. But the champions are finally regained their mojo late in the season, so there’s nothing to be ashamed of there. Otherwise, Ronald Koeman’s men have been one of the Premier League’s form sides of late, with five wins and a draw at Arsenal in their last seven matches. They’re a formidable proposition, especially as they’ve been stingy in the extreme since the return of Fraser Forster: just those two goals conceded against Chelsea since his return in mid-January. The Cherries could do with a result; the Saints have been imperious recently. It augurs well for quite the event. As does the record of previous meetings. The clubs have met 22 times in the past. Only three of those matches have ended goalless. Meanwhile look at some of these scorelines through the ages: 3-2, 4-3, 5-2, 7-0. Any of those tonight would do rather nicely. It’s Dorset! Coming straight at Hampshire! It’s on! Kick off: 7.45pm GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/nov/20/fukushima-clean-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-20T22:06:10Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: coming clean | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/20/fukushima-clean-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/20/fukushima-clean-editorial","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima: coming clean","bodyText":"Like Chernobyl, Three Mile Island or any other major nuclear accident, Fukushima Daiichi will be with us for decades to come. The entire plant is being decommissioned, a clean-up they reckon could take 40 years. After a disaster of these proportions, when three reactors suffered meltdowns after being hit by a giant tsunami, nothing its operator does or says today is taken at face value in Japan. The ability of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) to handle the build-up of toxic water used to contain the melted cores is being questioned as never before, after a string of water and radiation leaks and one incident in which six men were doused with contaminated water. The embattled company faces plummeting morale, a shortage of skilled labour, insufficient funds – all exacerbated, according to some, by a refusal to accept outside help. For all this, it is worth reading what Naomi Hirose, Tepco's latest president, had to say in an interview with the Guardian. What happened at Fukushima, he said, was a lesson to the world: \"Try to examine all the possibilities no matter how small they are, and don't think any single counter-measure is foolproof.\" In hindsight, one tiny detail, such as waterproof seals on doors, would have saved everything. Is the unthinkable being thought as Britain plans for a new generation of reactors? Fukushima prompted the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation to conduct a safety review in which Mike Weightman, its chief inspector, concluded there were no fundamental safety weaknesses, although his report identified 38 areas for improvement. Is the review, as the independent nuclear analyst John Large maintains, a whitewash? Would UK reactors, as he contends, not survive an hour without power? Documents released under freedom of information rules showed that all eight coastal nuclear locations in the UK, including Hinkley Point, were at risk of flooding and coastal erosion, which would worsen with climate change. The point here is not whether we need nuclear power. It is whether the nuclear industry in Britain is learning from disasters. Is it coming clean about all the risks associated with the venture? The pressure to produce the answer that confirms the consensus view is intense. Fukushima prompted Japan to close all 50 nuclear power plants. Little surprise that at the UN climate talks in Warsaw, Japan, which is the world's fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gas, slashed plans to reduce emissions from 25% to 3.8% on 2005 figures. Hiroshi Minami, Japan's chief negotiator, said that with no nuclear power, Japan has to lower its \"ambition level\" on greenhouse gases. In the short term, Japan is trapped, as are we all, in a vicious circle of greenhouse gas dependency and worsening climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2014/jun/17/china-trade-visit-bp-shell-liquefied-natural-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-17T18:19:00Z","webTitle":"China trade visit: BP and Shell set for billion pound LNG deals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/17/china-trade-visit-bp-shell-liquefied-natural-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jun/17/china-trade-visit-bp-shell-liquefied-natural-gas","fields":{"headline":"China trade visit: BP and Shell set for billion pound LNG deals","bodyText":"BP has announced a long-term deal to supply liquefied natural gas to China worth around $20bn (£11.8bn), in one of a number of trade deals announced during the visit of the Chinese prime minister. The deal will see the oil and gas group provide state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) with LNG for 20 years. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell extended an agreement with CNOOC to work on energy projects around the world, including LNG. Engineering company Rolls-Royce has signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese nuclear reactor manufacturer SNPTC to cooperate on civil nuclear power projects in the UK and other markets. The Derby-based firm currently supplies emergency diesel generators to almost 40% of all nuclear reactors in China that are in operation or under construction. The London Stock Exchange also signed agreements with the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China to strengthen the Chinese renminbi offshore market in the UK and to provide access to cash for Chinese companies. LSE chairman Chris Gibson Smith said: \"London is the world's most international financial market and a natural partner to China in its ambitious global development.\" At the end of last year, the prime minister led a delegation of 100 business executives to China, although Chinese state media dismissed the UK as \"an old European country\" and criticised policy on Hong Kong and the Dalai Lama. Since then, London-based Silvergate Media has signed a deal with state TV to broadcast Peter Rabbit; luxury furniture maker Duresta Upholstery has announced it will open three shops in China with more than 20 planned in 2015; and London-software company TestPlant has opened an office in China. On Tuesday, China Minsheng Investment Corporation, a newly created private sector investment group, is expected to open its European headquarters in London, with $1.5bn (£883m) to invest in financial services, offshore projects, energy and environment. Another Chinese financial services group, Nord Engine, is planning to invest £150m to help Europe's small and medium-sized tech companies get into the Chinese market. Bridget Walsh, head of Greater China business services for the UK and Ireland at Ernst &amp; Young, said British companies had a \"significant double digit opportunity over the next few years in China. \"We are not looking at doubling, we are looking at quadrupling [UK trade with China]\". \"The Chinese middle class are predicted to account for more than $6 trillion of global consumption over the next 10 years and that is a huge opportunity for British companies to take their brand to China\". She highlighted two sectors where British companies were likely to do well. Clothing and food are likely to continue to grow as the middle class expands. Secondly, companies offering architectural or sustainable development services could benefit from China's growing interest in improving quality of life in its cities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/31/cumbria-nuclear-waste-dump-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-31T17:52:00Z","webTitle":"Cumbria sticks it to the nuclear dump lobby – despite all the carrots on offer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/31/cumbria-nuclear-waste-dump-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/31/cumbria-nuclear-waste-dump-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Cumbria sticks it to the nuclear dump lobby – despite all the carrots on offer","bodyText":"Cumbria county council's decision to \"dump the dump\" by voting against a nuclear waste repository close to the Lake District has drilled a nasty great hole in the middle of the government's wider nuclear strategy. Ministers had made clear that part of the agreement with the public over a new generation of atomic power stations would involve finding a safe and permanent home for the high-level waste created by the old ones. Cumbria's decision is a body blow for government because though it may not necessarily have been the most geologically suitable spot, it certainly was the most politically suitable. The \"energy coast\", as the region calls itself, is home to Sellafield, formerly Windscale, the largest nuclear complex in Europe with more than 5,000 well-paid jobs, as well as the nuclear submarine-building base at Barrow-in-Furness. Even a secretarial job there can pay £10 an hour, and to win votes in the local constituency you need to pin your nuclear colour – yellow – to the mast, as the MP for Copeland, Jamie Reed, and his predecessor, \"Neutron Jack\" Cunningham, have done. The Unite union, representing many Sellafield workers, can also be relied upon to bang the nuclear drum on a national level, and was quick to condemn the county council's decision on Wednesday. The government had dangled all kinds of carrots in front of Cumbria's local and regional councils, including the prospect that up to 1,000 jobs could be created from the proposed £12bn underground project. It made some headway when Copeland and Allerdale councils voted in favour of further dialogue, but that was not enough without the county council. Now, if an area steeped in a nuclear culture is not prepared to countenance a waste dump, then who will? The difficulties were highlighted when Shepway local council in Kent took it upon itself to start a consultation on whether residents wanted to find out more about building an underground storage facility on Romney Marshes. The councillors were worried about unemployment prospects as the reactors at the local atomic power station at Dungeness approach the end of their lives and face decommissioning. But the proposal was shelved almost as soon as it was made public as a massive political and public backlash got underway. Who else is going to step up to the plate? It is hard enough to build a tried-and-tested, relatively small gas-fired power station, never mind a high-speed rail link or a radioactive waste dump. Government attempts to allow low-level atomic waste in traditionally approved sites such as King's Cliffe near Peterborough and Lilyhall in Cumbria have also faced huge opposition. A lot of the high-level waste planned for a dump to be opened in Cumbria before the middle of this century is currently stored above ground at Sellafield. The rest is kept in the same way at the atomic power plants where it was created, such as Sizewell in Suffolk. Another option would be to bury the waste at sea or ship it abroad, as has happened with spent nuclear fuel to Japan and Germany. Technically, both could be done but the environmental and political opposition would be immense. The US government has been battling to dump waste in the middle of an unpopulated desert, and it is impossible to imagine any country, other than one that is seriously impoverished, giving the idea of waste imports more than five minutes' thought. That looks like a non-starter so reopening dialogue with Cumbrians may be the only option. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, knows this as he sets out on a heroic sales job to try to save the repository and potentially a new nuclear power programme beset with delays and rows over subsidy levels. There will now be enormous pressure on those unco-operative Cumbrian county councillors. Davey was no doubt thinking of them when he said: \"For any host community, there will be a substantial community benefits package and worth hundreds of millions of pounds. That is in addition to the hundreds of jobs and major investment that such a huge infrastructure project could bring.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/29/insulation-solar-answers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-29T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: Insulation and solar are the answers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/29/insulation-solar-answers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/29/insulation-solar-answers","fields":{"headline":"Insulation and solar are the answers","bodyText":"David Cameron's proposals to roll back green taxes (Report, 28 October), which account for around 4% of an average energy bill, rather than tackling the underlying causes of rising prices and increasing fuel poverty, are symptomatic of the government's chaotic energy policy. At the moment gas prices in the UK are lower than in most European countries, but UK households use more energy and so pay more due to lack of sufficient home insulation. Yet the government is investing next to nothing in insulation and failing to support serious investment in renewables. The National Grid Future Energy Scenario in 2012 predicted that with proper investment in renewables, the UK could become free of energy imports by 2020. Instead of pouring billions of pounds into additional subsidies for dangerous and polluting new nuclear power stations, which will only come online too late (if ever) to address our energy gap, the government should switch to a proper programme of investment in insulation and proven, clean and safe renewables. This would provide Britain with energy security, tackle fuel poverty and create lasting jobs. Denise Craghill York • George Monbiot advocates using as much renewable energy as possible, but then downplays its potential in favour of nuclear power. When it comes to solar, as the Royal Society says, \"no other sustainable energy source comes close\". Contrary to Monbiot's claims, solar across all the UK's roofs would exceed current fossil power supply. Solar's full potential can be increasingly realised as storage systems commercialise. Cost reductions in solar have been so exceptional that by 2018 we anticipate large-scale solar will need lower public support than nuclear is due to receive in 2023 – and for 15 years, not nuclear's 35 years. Furthermore, solar puts power directly in the hands of millions of people, not a single utility or overseas state. Nearly half a million homes have now gone solar in the UK. Whatever the controversies over nuclear power, credit to the government for backing this winning technology.

But with resistance growing in Bavaria, the project looks more likely to divide the country that unite it. Renewables produced almost 25% of Germany's energy in 2013. But production is uneven and expected to get even more so: while windfarms in the northern flatlands are forecast to eventually outstrip the area's power needs, the highly industrialised south is still heavily reliant on nuclear energy. Solar power, though more prevalent in the south, is still too unreliable to compensate for the planned phasing out of five nuclear power stations in the southern half of the country. The new energy highway is meant to even out this imbalance. Hailed as the \"aorta of the energy revolution\" by the companies behind the plans, the new high-voltage power line would start in Wilster in Schleswig-Holstein and end in Grafenrheinfeld in Bavaria. Currently, most of the line will be carried on masts up to 70 metres high, but TransnetBW said parts of the line may run underground near built-up areas. In addition to the main energy highway, there are also plans for corridors branching out east and west, totalling 1,700 miles (2,800km) in length. Energy companies hope the project, which they say will cost under €10bn (£8.3bn), will be green-lighted in 2015 and finished by 2022. But particularly in the south of the country, a protest movement is forming in opposition to the plans. In Franconia in northern Bavaria, an initiative against the south-east energy corridor called Citizens against Monster Pylons has already amassed over 1,000 members. As well as voicing concerns about health risks and dropping property values for those living near high-voltage lines, they argue that the south's energy needs would be more easily met through new gas power stations, or even wind farms, in southern Bavaria. Last summer, the German parliament passed a law that paved the way for the new energy highway. But in the light of the current protests, a number of local politicians are making objections to the project. Horst Seehofer, the head of the Bavarian CSU – sister party to Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats – has already called for a freeze on plans for further energy lines. \"It is possible to both be massively in support of the nuclear phaseout and put up a massive fight if we are going about the wrong way of achieving it,\" Seehofer said. But politicians in the north are accusing the CSU of trying to sabotage the entire Energiewende (energy transition). \"When we switch off the last nuclear power station, we also need renewable energy in Bavaria,\" said Robert Habeck, Schleswig-Holstein's energy minister. \"That was the decision we made after Fukushima. Those who now attack plans for extending the energy network are in fact dismissing the entire phaseout.\" Currently, public support for Energiewende is still high: a survey in October last year showed 84% of Germans back the nuclear phaseout. But the rising cost has become a growing concern, and last month the new energy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, vowed to cut subsidies for wind, solar and other renewables – a move criticised in the north and cheered in the south. Unless the new government manages to reconcile national priorities with the dynamics of its federal system, the mood could quickly turn against Germany's green revolution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/feb/18/germany-renewable-energy-green-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-18T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Green crusader turned her horror at Chernobyl into a successful enterprise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/18/germany-renewable-energy-green-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/18/germany-renewable-energy-green-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Green crusader turned her horror at Chernobyl into a successful enterprise","bodyText":"The press in Germany persist in calling her the \"electricity rebel\", but when you walk into the offices of Elektrizitätswerke Schönau (EWS), the co-op headed by Ursula Sladek, you get quite the opposite impression. The walls are covered in awards of all sorts, a clear sign of recognition. A couple of items are particularly striking: the environment prize presented to her in 2013 by President Joachim Gauck, the most prestigious, richly endowed award made by the federal authorities; on the opposite wall hang two photographs of Sladek talking to Barack Obama at the White House. That was in 2011, just after she received the Goldman prize, commonly seen as the Nobel in this field. What Sladek, 67, has achieved, with the support of other people in Schönau – a small town in the Black Forest – is somehow typically German and yet wholly unprecedented. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 had a profound effect on this schoolteacher and mother of five. She and her husband started campaigning vigorously with others in the community to stop using nuclear-generated electricity. The local power company refused to find alternative sources, but after a 10-year struggle and two referendums (aka citizens' initiatives) Sladek and her fellow campaigners managed to buy the network and turn it into a co-operative. After deregulation of the energy market in 1997 EWS started to extend its reach beyond Schönau's 2,600 residents. It now supplies 135,000 customers all over Germany and holds shares in other networks wishing to deliver green electricity. The Stuttgart municipal network is a recent arrival. The co-operative is a flourishing concern, with 3,300 members and 92 employees. In 2012 it reported sales of €140m ($190m) with €4.3m net profit. \"We have never lost money, apart from the first year,\" Sladek boasts. She and her husband have headed the organisation since the beginning. EWS sets two conditions when selecting suppliers: they must have no connection with nuclear power or coal, and their equipment must be less than six years old. \"We're supplied by generators in Germany, but also wind farms in Austria and Norwegian hydroelectric plants. All of our electricity comes from renewable energy sources,\" Sladek says. Many experts are still casting doubt on wind and solar power, asking how they can deliver when there is no breeze or sunlight, but Sladek is not impressed. \"A majority of our customers are residential consumers,\" she says, \"but we also supply small businesses and even large firms such as dm-drogerie markt, a cosmetics and household goods retailer, and the chocolate manufacturer Ritter Sport, which shows our supply is reliable. Industry can't have power cuts.\" EWS offers competitive prices too, \"because our shareholders don't expect a 15% return, only about 4% which is a lot better than a savings account. What's more our management earns less than in conventional organisations and we advertise less,\" Sladek says. Some customers are nevertheless prepared to pay a little more for their electricity, so that EWS can help households or small companies invest in renewable energy sources for their own use. In 2012 the co-op spent €1.5m supporting about 500 projects of this sort. Keen to see its customers consume less energy while taking more interest in underlying issues, EWS organises training courses and debates on various subjects. The funds obtained from its many awards help to subsidise other civically engaged projects. \"In the 1970s, when we were campaigning against nuclear power, we realised that people know a lot about the subject. That's why civic participation is a key feature of our commitment,\" Sladek says. Though she is prepared to \"work with all [political] parties\", she has always refused to join any of them.

The statement by Lord Browne, one of the most powerful energy figures in Britain, contradicts claims by David Cameron and George Osborne that shale gas exploration could help curb soaring energy bills. Browne added to the government's ongoing troubles over energy policy by labelling nuclear power as \"very, very expensive indeed\" and describing the fact that more state subsidies are given to oil and gas than to renewable energy as \"like running both the heating and the air conditioning at the same time\". The former chief executive of BP, who now holds a senior government position as lead non-executive director, told an audience at the London School of Economics that climate change was \"existentially important\", but that without gas the transition to a zero-carbon energy system would never happen. However, Browne, who is the chairman of fracking company Cuadrilla, said: \"I don't know what the contribution of shale gas will be to the energy mix of the UK. We need to drill probably 10-12 wells and test them and it needs to be done as quickly as possible.\" \"We are part of a well-connected European gas market and, unless it is a gigantic amount of gas, it is not going to have material impact on price,\" he said. In August, Cameron said: \"If we don't back this technology, we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills … fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down.\" In July, Osborne said: \"This a real chance to get cheaper energy for Britain … a major new energy source that can reduce energy bills.\" High-profile protests hampered Cuadrilla's operations at Balcombe in Sussex in the summer but Browne said: \"Cuadrilla is not going to frack at Balcombe.\" Browne said there was no evidence that fracking itself had caused water pollution in the US, but said there had been \"issues to do with the leaking of gas into aquifers as a result of imperfect operations, mainly to do with the cementing of well casings.\" In March, the Guardian revealed that Browne and Cuadrilla had been reprimanded in a meeting with the then energy minister Charles Hendry for failing to inform government that earthquakes caused by Cuadrilla's drilling had caused a well casing to deform. Browne also said: \"There have been some bad practices in the US in the disposal of waste water.\" But he criticised the government for failing to create appropriate regulations for fracking: \"We have been behind in trying to create the right regulations.\" Ministers rejected the Royal Society's recommendation in June that specific fracking regulations are drawn up, a suggestion Browne backs, arguing that the current patchwork of regulation from the energy department, the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and planning rules are sufficient. Browne criticised the UK's fossil fuel subsidies: \"In 2011, the UK spent over £4bn supporting the production and consumption of oil and gas, more than they spent to support renewable energy.\" Across the OECD, he added, $80bn every year is spent supporting production of carbon-based fuels: \"It is like running both the heating and the air conditioning at the same time,\" he said. On Friday, energy minister Michael Fallon announced that the latest oil and gas licencing round had seen an all-time record number of licences awarded and that independent oil and gas companies would be encouraged to invest and undertake additional exploration. Browne said nuclear power was one of the safest energy sources available, but said that had come at a cost: \"Nuclear power has become very, very expensive indeed.\" In October, ministers agreed a deal to pay French state energy company EDF billions of pounds in subsidies if it goes ahead with two new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, a deal that left some analysts \"flabbergasted\" at the cost. Browne also said the siting of new reactors on the coast when sea level and storm surges are rising was a \"big issue\" and that they must be made resilient. Lord Adair Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority and Committee on Climate Change, introduced Browne's lecture and agreed that the cost projections for nuclear power were \"disappointing\" compared to a 2008 analysis he led. Turner said that in contrast, solar power costs had fallen \"beyond our wildest dreams\" by about 80% in five years. Browne, once known as the \"sun king\" and who said he is now co-head of the largest private equity renewable energy fund in the world at Riverstone Holdings, said: \"Solar is a very good technology and we should use more of it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2016/feb/27/west-ham-sunderland-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-27T14:39:56Z","webTitle":"West Ham United 1-0 Sunderland: Premier League - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/feb/27/west-ham-sunderland-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2016/feb/27/west-ham-sunderland-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"West Ham United 1-0 Sunderland: Premier League - as it happened","bodyText":"M’Vila sends a high hail Mary into the box. Adrian rises to claim. And that’s it. How did that stay 1-0? Sunderland threw everything at West Ham in the second half, and carved out some decent chances, but couldn’t find the net. The hosts held firm, and they move up to fifth in the Premier League table. Sunderland stay in the relegation places. An entertaining match, if slightly light on quality. But quality can be over-rated: that was good fun. Not that Sam Allardyce, who trudges off glumly down the tunnel, will agree. No victory on his return to Upton Park. Ah well, he’ll be hoping to have another go at his former club next season, providing he can keep Sunderland up of course. If his players start taking some of these chances they’re creating, they’ve every chance. 90 min +2: Sunderland load the box for a throw on the right. Yedlin launches it in. The ball drops towards M’Vila on the edge of the area, but his own man Rodwell gets in the way, and he can’t shoot. 90 min: There will be three added minutes. Upton Park is a tense venue right now. 89 min: Sunderland are seeing more of the ball, but passes aren’t sticking in the final third. Time is not their friend. 87 min: Van Aanholt sends Khazri into the West Ham box down the left. Khazri attempts a rabona, only for the ball to clank off his standing leg and out of play. He takes a fresh-air swipe, and sends himself skittering hysterically across the turf on his teeth. That’s ludicrous in so many ways, not least because time’s running out and you can’t be showboating like that in these circumstances. You’ll be seeing that again, I’ll be bound. 85 min: A free kick for Sunderland in the middle of the West Ham half. It’s lumped into the area by Khazri. Carroll heads out for a corner on the left. Van Aanholt sends the set piece screaming straight through the area and out on the other side. On the touchline, Sam Allardyce is loading up with gum. Many small pieces are in his mouth now, moving around like mad molecules. He knows this isn’t over yet. 83 min: Payet slips a marvellous pass down the inside-left channel for Antonio, who tries to shuttle it on to the underlapping Cresswell. But the ball’s played behind the full back. Then another wave of West Ham attack. Payet chests down, just to the left of the D, and whips a volley inches wide right. Mannone was beaten all ends up. 82 min: Noble is replaced by Obiang. 80 min: Kirchhoff makes another delightful defence-splitting pass, this time down the inside-left channel, to release N’Doye into the West Ham area. N’Doye curls low towards the bottom right, but Adrian parries with a strong hand. Rodwell, picking up the loose ball on the other side, yet again can’t get a clean shot away. Sunderland have given this a real go in the second half. It’s not clear how they’ve failed to score. 78 min: How is this still 1-0? A heavy touch by Byram in his own area sets Rodwell up, ten yards from goal! He must score, but Byram recovers to get a block in at full stretch, and Rodwell’s shot is deflected over the bar. The resulting corner ripples the side netting. 76 min: And now West Ham hit the woodwork again! Noble, out on the left, hits diagonally and deep towards Byram at the right-hand post. Byram heads across and down towards Carroll, who meets the ball first time with a rasping Zidane-style volley from six yards. He’s got to score, but somehow the ball twangs off the crossbar, is cushioned by Van Aanholt just in front of the line, and into Mannone’s arms. It’s slightly surprising that the goalframe hasn’t crumbled into splinters. 74 min: A long ball down the inside right. Kone shepherds it out of play, but not without needlessly handling Payet into touch. On another day, a referee’s pointing to the penalty spot. It would have been a soft one, but you’ve seen them given. Not this time, though. And seconds later, Sunderland have the ball in the net up the other end! But it won’t count. Kirchhoff slide-rules a gorgeous pass down the right to release Yedlin into the box. Yedlin reaches the byline and pulls it back for Rodwell on the penalty spot. Rodwell opens his body up, and sidefoots powerfully towards the bottom left. But Adrian sticks a boot out to make a marvellous save! The rebound clanks into Rodwell’s hanging arm. Rodwell spins and dispatches the ball into the unguarded right-hand portion of the net, but having handled, it’s never going to be given. Sunderland so close. 72 min: Khazri - who has been Sunderland’s greatest threat today, although that’s not saying a whole load - takes the free kick. He gets it up and over the wall, but without pace. As the ball sails towards the bottom left, Adrian scuttles over to catch the gently dropping effort. 71 min: N’Doye powers down the middle before playing a clever reverse pass down the inside-left channel for Defoe. Yellow card magnet Byram bundles Defoe over. That’s his 10th booking of the season, and he’ll miss the next two matches. And this is a free kick in a dangerous position. 69 min: Moses cuts in from the left and sends a low shot towards the bottom-left corner. It’s weak and easily gathered by Mannone. Sunderland go up the other end through Yedlin, who makes ground on the right but can’t find anyone in the area with his pull-back from deep. 68 min: Antonio gets on the end of a Carroll knock-down, just inside the Sunderland area on the right. He crosses, hits O’Shea on the chest, and claims a penalty kick. No dice! The ball breaks to Payet, to the right of the D. He sends a screamer over the bar. He’s been uncharacteristically off today, Payet. Still plenty of time to do something jaw-dropping, of course. 66 min: Rodwell is immediately into the action, battling Ogbonna and Kouyate as he bustles down the left wing. He nearly gets past the West Ham pair, but not quite, and runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. But this is an attacking substitution by Allardyce. Sunderland really need something from this match. Sunderland really need something from every remaining match. There’s little room for error. 65 min: Lanzini can’t complete 90 minutes on his comeback. He’s withdrawn in favour of Moses. Meanwhile Sunderland make their first change, swapping Cattermole for Rodwell. 63 min: Payet tries to free Lanzini on the left. Sunderland are woefully light at the back, but for once the West Ham midfielder plays a poor ball. Stop the press! 60 min: Space and time for M’Vila, 25 yards from goal in a central position. He looks to curl one into the top right, but his effort is weak and wide. He grabs at thin air in frustration. “Not being a top, top reader I misread Sunderland’s gesture as them giving free shirts to West Ham fans,” writes Ian Copestake. “As a result I wasn’t sure why they were being praised other than for bringing sarcasm back into the game.” It’s an idea, though. And people thought half-and-half scarves were the living end. 59 min: Bilic, aware his team need jolting into action, replaces the invisible Emenike with Carroll. 58 min: Defoe is going nowhere 25 yards from goal, just to the left of the West Ham goal. He’s needlessly upended by Noble. A free kick in a very dangerous position. But N’Doye blasts it witlessly into the West Ham wall. No Philippe Coutinho he. However, West Ham can’t keep carrying on like this: they’ve been asleep since the restart. A more confident team than Sunderland would have equalised by now. 55 min: Khazri and Byram get involved in a playful shoving match as Van Aanholt prepares to throw into the area. All good natured, though the crowd don’t think so. West Ham appear distracted, as Khazri and Van Aanholt combine to spring the latter into the box. Van Aanholt, who owes his team something today after his part in the West Ham goal, blasts a wild shot over the bar from 12 yards. A chance to get something on target at the very least. 52 min: Sunderland have come out with renewed purpose. Khazri, who has been lively today bordering on excellent, nearly Cruyff Turns his way between two men down the left. He then floats a deep cross dangerously towards the far post, but neither Defoe nor N’Doye can rise to meet it with a header from close range. 51 min: Lanzini makes off down the left and earns a corner off Cattermole. Payet and Noble attempt the old Beckham-Scholes routine, but Payet’s ball is too floaty, Noble can’t meet it with a volley, and Kirchhoff comes out to block. 49 min: Defoe misses another sitter. Khazri skitters in from the left, draws a couple of claret shirts, and slips a ball down the inside-left channel to release Defoe into the box. Defoe’s low curler across Adrian sails wide right. He should have scored. His blushes are spared when the offside flag goes up, though only in strict theoretical terms, because not for the first time, it’s an incorrect decision by the linesman. 47 min: A quiet start to the half suddenly explodes when Collins misjudges Cattermole’s basic lump down the inside-right channel. Defoe is free on the edge of the area, meeting a dropping ball! But he pulls it woefully wide right of goal, to the audible joy of the home support. West Ham set the ball rolling for the second half. Sunderland now have the worse defensive record in the 2015-16 Premier League: 51 goals conceded. But they have scored in 10 of their previous 13 away games, so there is hope. Half-time reading: Hats off to Sunderland for this. Every little helps, as some rather more rapacious capitalists once said. An entertaining half comes to an end. Sunderland were, on the whole, containing their hosts, but Van Aanholt’s mistake and Antonio’s fine run and finish has tipped the balance in West Ham’s favour. Sunderland need a response in the second-half. They found one against both Manchester City and Liverpool, with varying results. Can they do it again here? We’ll find out soon enough. 44 min: Kirchoff, playing at quarterback, tries to release Yedlin down the Sunderland right. Not quite, but full marks for ambition. Otherwise, there’s a general sense that both teams will be happy to hear the half-time whistle: West Ham to put their feet up after a job well done, Sunderland so they can re-inflate their spirit. 42 min: Allardyce refuses to give the ball to Cresswell, as West Ham prepare to take a quick throw. All good-natured, and performed in the comedic style. Both manager and player enjoy the moment and a good laugh, but the home crowd aren’t so enamoured with their erstwhile boss, and a few boos ring out. It had to happen at some point. 40 min: Byram, who likes a basic challenge every now and then, bowls N’Doye over on the Sunderland left. From the free kick, Van Aanholt romps down the wing and wins a corner. It’s hit deep by Khazri, but Defoe can’t rise to connect at the far post. Adrian gathers. That’s a little better from Sunderland, who have looked rather deflated since spoiling all their good early work. 37 min: M’Vila floats an easy-to-intercept crossfield ball to the Sunderland right. Payet steps in and romps down the West Ham left. He earns a corner off Kone. From the set piece, the ball’s shuttled to Antonio out on the right. He’s got his back to goal, 25 yards out. He flicks it up, spins, and unleashes a dipper towards the bottom right. Memo to Adrian: that’s how to make like Le Tissier. Mannone gets down to turn the ball around the post for a corner. A marvellous save, and the corner comes to nothing. What an effort from Antonio, though! 35 min: Lanzini jinks down the middle of the park, and looks for the top corner from 25 yards. Nope! 32 min: Big Sam slumps back in his chair, hands forced into his coat pockets. He’s chewing quite a lot. I wouldn’t fancy being Van Aanholt at half-time, though I’d pay ready money to be a fly on the dressing-room wall. West Ham score out of nothing! A hopeful punt down the right touchline should be dispatched into the stand by Van Aanholt. But the Sunderland full back attempts a clever flick back up the wing. It’s intercepted by Antonio, who squeezes past a couple of neon-green shirts and into the box, before carefully passing one across Mannone and into the bottom-left corner! A glorious finish, but what on earth was Van Aanholt thinking there? And Sunderland looking pretty comfortable too. 29 min: Sunderland have done well so far, restricting West Ham to that long-range Noble bash. The crowd have gone a little quiet. And having said that ... 27 min: Sam Allardyce is out on the touchline screaming “Long throw! Long throw!” Yedlin launches it into the West Ham area. Head tennis. It’s eventually cleared by the home side, but they didn’t look particularly comfortable there. On another day, that might have fallen to the lurking Defoe. It’s almost as though Allardyce knows exactly what he’s talking about, isn’t it. 25 min: Cresswell is rather foolishly upended by N’Doye as he makes good down the left. A chance for West Ham to load the box now, and for Payet to take one of his trademark free kicks. He curls it in with menace, but it’s cleared by O’Shea. It’s not the highest quality match you’ll ever see, but since when has quality been the be-all and end-all? This is good end-to-end fun right now. 23 min: ... Khazri hits the bar! He loops one direct towards the top left, with everyone expecting the common-or-garden cross, the box loaded with players. He nearly catches Adrian out. Not quite, but it twangs off the top of the crossbar. That’s one each, then. 22 min: Sunderland earn a corner on the left. Van Aanholt fires it into the side netting. But from the goal kick, the ball’s played back to Adrian, who suddenly decides to showcase his Le Tissier flick-up skills. What nonsense. He’s charged down by Khazri, and the ball nearly balloons back into the net. Instead, it breaks to the Sunderland right, where Cresswell upends Kirchoff in a challenge for the loose ball. Free kick, to the right of the West Ham box. From which ... 20 min: West Ham hit the bar! Lanzini sashays in from the left, drops a shoulder to skate past a couple of challenges, then lays off to Noble, powering down the inside-right channel. From 25 yards, Noble creams a rising shot towards the top right. It’s going in, but Mannone gets a fingertip to the ball, and pushes it onto the underside of the bar. The ball bounces out. Emenike can’t follow up with a header, and he’s offside anyway. 19 min: Antonio Rory Delaps a throw into the Sunderland box from the right. The ball’s allowed to drop into the six-yard box. Penny for Sam Allardyce’s thoughts. Yedlin eventually hoofs away from danger. 17 min: Cresswell has been West Ham’s most dangerous threat so far. The full back again strides down the left, and whips a low cross into the six-yard box. Mannone makes a nine-course tasting menu of gathering, but gather he does, eventually. 16 min: It’s all gone a bit scrappy. Then, suddenly, Kirchoff sticks a boot in to dispossess Kouyate in the centre circle. Cattermole latches onto the loose ball and slide-rules Defoe clear down the middle! Defoe takes a step into the box and pokes straight at Adrian, who smothers. The flag goes up for offside anyway, though it was an incorrect decision: the striker was level with the last defender when the pass was played. So close to the opener. 13 min: Cattermole charges down Ogbonna’s clearance. Kirchoff picks up the loose ball, but his first-time pass forward for Defoe is too strong. Then Sunderland come again at the Hammers, Cresswell misjudging a bouncer down the right wing. N’Doye would have been through on goal had he not slipped over while Cresswell was making his mistake. 11 min: Kouyate goes on a purposeful stride down the middle, before sliding the ball down the inside-left channel for the ambitious Cresswell. The resulting pass inside, meant for Emenike, isn’t up to much. West Ham are slowly asserting themselves here. 9 min: A couple of long balls nearly come off. First Cresswell is sent scampering after a hoof down the West Ham left. He cuts inside but is harried off it by Kone. Then up the other end, Defoe very nearly latches onto an agricultural hoick down the middle, but the ball is carried on a fairly strong wind back to Adrian. 7 min: After a bright start, Sunderland are having a little difficulty staying on the ball. West Ham knock it around the back awhile, maybe with a view to staying warm. It’s very cold in east London. 5 min: Van Aanholt rather clumsily and needlessly gives away a corner down the West Ham right. From the set piece, Payet dribbles around on the wing and earns another. That one’s hooked clear by M’Vila. Both teams are showing a fair bit of ambition in attack. Positive mindsets. Meanwhile, it transpires that a job lot of free away shirts have been distributed among the Sunderland travelling support, hence the preponderance of that particular neon garment. That’s a stylish move by Sunderland, at least in one respect. 3 min: But West Ham only half clear that second corner, and Khazri is soon bursting into the box down the right. Fortunately for the home team, there’s nobody but Collins in the six-yard box, and the big West Ham defender can blooter clear. 2 min: A bit of space for Cattermole down the right. He looks to hook the ball into the area, but it comes off Cresswell for the first corner of the match. And then there’s another corner as Ogbonna heads behind. Emenike clears that one. Jermain Defoe - a fair bit more unpopular round these parts than Sam Allardyce, after chipping off to Spurs with extreme prejudice in 2004 - gets the ball rolling. It’s soon sent sailing out of play on the right. The teams are out! A marvellous atmosphere at Upton Park, with bubbles flying around like billy-o. That machine’s forever blowing them. West Ham are bedecked in the Victorian splendour of their claret-and-blue kit. Sunderland are in nuclear-power-plant-incident green. Tradition’s not the be-all and end-all. And in fairness, that shirt seems popular with the travelling support: the away end is a verdant pleasure. We’ll be off in a minute or two! Sam Allardyce was interviewed on tape earlier. He’s hoping to get a good reception today. “It’d be nice.” All the news that’s fit to print. Slaven Bilic speaks! “It is a special game for Sam, he was a very long time here. They don’t need special motivation because of their league position, though. And they will be very confident after their last couple of results. Any team in the world would have taken those results, Liverpool away and Manchester United at home. So we are expecting a very difficult game. We have to be direct, but at the same time patient. They are organised and dangerous. But our form is good and we are confident. It was difficult to leave Pedro Obiang and Victor Moses out, because they were playing well but it is good that we have options. Manuel Lanzini is one of our key players.” This week marked the 23rd anniversary of Bobby Moore’s passing. It’s the last time the West Ham and England legend can be remembered at the old ground he graced between 1958 and 1974, so respectful tributes are in order. Some of the heroes of the 1960s will take to the pitch at half time in order to commemorate the great man. The fans meanwhile have already been doing their thing outside Upton Park... West Ham make three changes to the team that routed Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup last weekend. Adrian, Sam Byram and Manuel Lanzini are in; Darren Randolph, Pedro Obiang and Victor Moses all drop to the bench. Sunderland name the same starting XI that beat Manchester United a fortnight ago. Hey, if it ain’t broke. West Ham United: Adrian, Byram, Ogbonna, Collins, Cresswell, Kouyate, Noble, Lanzini, Antonio, Emenike, Payet. Subs: Randolph, Song, Carroll, Obiang, Moses, Henry, Oxford. Sunderland: Mannone, Yedlin, Kone, O’Shea, Van Aanholt, Kirchhoff, N’Doye, Cattermole, M’Vila, Khazri, Defoe. Subs: Jones, Larsson, Rodwell, Borini, Pickford, Kaboul, Toivonen. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). A point for West Ham United will propel the Hammers into the European places; a point for Sunderland will see the Mackems rise above the relegation waterline. A big match this, then, for both teams. Yet it’s really all about Big Sam, isn’t it. You can make a case that Sam Allardyce saved West Ham United. He rescued them from the Championship, then consolidated their status as a Premier League team. No thrashing around helplessly in the lower reaches a la Middlesbrough, Fulham, Leeds, Wolves or Sheffield Wednesday for the Hammers. That achievement is undeniable, and in its own way the product of a brilliant mind. Then again, football fans pay vast quantities of cash money for their tickets - it’s easy for writers to spin intellectual beauty out of pragmatic football when they get into the stadium for free - and are therefore permitted to dream. West Ham fans self-identify as connoisseurs of fantasy football, which is fair enough. Allardyce called them “deluded”, but under new boss Slaven Bilic the Hammers are suddenly playing their prettiest stuff since the mid 1980s, harbouring dreams of European football next season, maybe even a first FA Cup for 36 years. Some delusion. As usual, the truth is almost certainly somewhere in the middle. Bilic is adamant that he couldn’t be doing any of this had Allardyce not built solid foundations. He thinks West Ham fans should applaud their former boss today rather than giving him the bird. “Sam did a great job here. He left me an organised training ground, some key players, he made my job a bit easier, and I appreciate it.” So it’ll be interesting to see what reception the big man receives. Ten pee says it’s a light smattering of indifferent applause and a total non-story. Forget I said anything. The Hammers will be favourites this afternoon. They’re coming off the back of a 5-1 FA Cup statement win at Blackburn, and in Dimitri Payet boast the player of the season. But Allardyce is doing his ship-steadying thing once more: Sunderland were desperately unlucky to lose at home to Manchester City, came from two down to earn a point at Liverpool, and hustled Manchester United out of it at the Stadium of Light for a crucial three points. There is hope! Another good result here - at a ground where Sunderland haven’t won since 2011 - and Sam will be heading back to Wearside with a great big grin spread across his boat. Of course, he’d only be thinking about the points in the context of Sunderland’s survival bid. Of course he would. Big Sam’s up for it. And it, ladies and gentlemen, is on! Kick off: 12.45pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theguardian/2013/dec/18/howard-clark-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-18T15:28:22Z","webTitle":"Howard Clark obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/18/howard-clark-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2013/dec/18/howard-clark-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Howard Clark obituary","bodyText":"Our friend Howard Clark, who has died suddenly aged 63, was a radical pacifist and full-time peace activist, organiser and researcher. As a student at the University of East Anglia from 1968 to 1971, he co-founded the UEA peace group and was a well-known figure on campus, always carrying a bundle of Peace News to sell. Born in Bath into a Methodist family, Howard was educated at the city's Kingswood school. After graduating from UEA, he joined Peace News as a co-editor. During this time he helped to launch a number of campaigns and organisations including London Greenpeace, the British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland Campaign, Campaign Against Arms Trade and the At Ease organisation, offering counselling for members of the armed forces. In 1976 he moved to York, where he threw himself into local community activities and grass-roots campaigning against racism and sexism. He also became involved in anti-nuclear power campaigning, and in May 1979 he was one of the coordinators of nonviolent training for the occupation of the Torness nuclear power site, near Dunbar, by the Torness Alliance. After relocating to Bradford in 1980 he worked with the Alternative Defence Commission, which produced the report Defence Without the Bomb. Then in 1985 he landed his dream job – working with War Resisters International (WRI) from their London office. Howard was an amazing networker – he listened to people, he remembered names and faces. Indeed, many of his friends feel that with his death they have lost part of their memory bank. During his time with WRI, he worked closely with nonviolent activists from around the globe: the End Conscription Campaign in South Africa, the peace and human rights groups in the Warsaw Pact countries of eastern Europe, citizens movements in South Asia and anti-conscription groups in South America. In 1994 he was one of the founders of the Balkan Peace Team and began his long involvement with nonviolent activists in Kosovo – resulting in the publication of his book Civil Resistance in Kosovo (2000). In 1996 Howard moved to Madrid with his partner, Yolanda. Their son, Ismael, was born in 2000 followed by their daughter, Violeta, in 2002. They all survive him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/23/outsourcing-ministers-resign-privatisation-nuclear-royal-mail","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-23T12:53:15Z","webTitle":"No wonder ministers love outsourcing.

It means never having to resign","bodyText":"When Lord Saatchi writes an article for the Daily Mail conceding the possibility that Marx may have been right about unbridled capitalism being doomed to fail, you know the ground is shifting. He does so as a helpful intervention to the debate about energy prices. At their core, his suggestions (and those of John Major more recently) contain an implicit acceptance that free-market theories of competition yielding efficiency, lower prices for customers and unfettered profit for providers don't quite work when applied to atypical oligopolies. B does not always follow A. This is nothing new to business. For at least a decade all manner of industries have started to take a long hard look at whether outsourcing is always the cheaper and better option, even when it comes to IT projects – the holy grail of outsourcing. Farming projects out is no longer the tacitly accepted automatic choice. So, why does privatisation persist as the automatic choice for a capitalist state? The government last week announced a deal for EDF to build a nuclear plant for the UK. The rationale is that the private sector is better at delivering such projects. However, as George Monbiot points out, we are getting outdated technology at the worst price imaginable, despite having better options on the table. And how can this project possibly be described as \"private sector\"? EDF is a company 85% owned by the French state. The bulk of the money behind the deal comes from companies owned by the Chinese state. The return on their investment is guaranteed by the British state. What a deal like this announces is not that we don't trust state-owned companies to undertake such projects. Just that we don't trust ourselves. The wholly illogical sale of a profitable Royal Mail at way below value; the refusal to consider leaving East Coast Rail in public management , despite consistent profits and record customer satisfaction; the lack of any discussion as to whether Royal Bank of Scotland would be better off nationalised. These are all examples of the shifting of public property into private management, and ultimately private ownership, at considerable cost to the public purse and with hugely uncertain results. It is easy to dismiss these as evangelical adherence to Thatcherite ideology, or as \"the nasty party\" creating profitable opportunities for its friends in the City. That is not to say these factors don't feature – I believe they do. Prominently, but not exclusively. Otherwise the involvement of the Liberal Democrats in these decisions is difficult to explain, as is the Labour leadership's refusal to commit to a reversal of any of these policies, despite recent polls showing it would be hugely popular with voters. There is an additional factor at work. Privatisation seems to have gone from dynamic ideological choice, to route of least resistance for the state to abdicate its responsibility in a variety of policy areas. Anything difficult and measurable – problem schools; elderly care; waste disposal; big infrastructure projects – is left to private capital. In exactly the same way that outsourcing has evolved for private enterprise, it has become an expensive way of getting rid of problems to which those in charge have no solutions. Not, I suggest, for reasons of efficiency any more – that ideological boat sailed with soaring energy bills, the fiasco of Railtrack, airport charges and bank bailouts. The prominent feature that privatisation has retained, and that must be nearly irresistible to career politicians, is plausible deniability. The last secretary of state to resign under the strict doctrine of ministerial responsibility was Lord Carrington, in 1982. Others have resigned since then, of course, for personal impropriety or because they were under pressure and couldn't perform the role or to spend time with their families. But Lord Carrington was the last one, so far as I am aware, to stand up and accept that although the mistake had nothing to do with him, it happened on his watch in his department, and therefore he had to go. Privatisation is an undeniable part of that landscape of shifting responsibility and protecting one's career, convenient to all politicians, to the left or right of centre. For which career politician would want to be in charge of the building of a nuclear plant and all that could go wrong with it? It is much easier to close a free school than to explain why a state school has gone disastrously wrong. It is much more comfortable to condemn a private care home for abusing the elderly than to explain mid-Staffs. We all pay over the odds for these privatised services so that the minister responsible has someone external to sack, instead of having to resign. From hallowed flamberge which was supposed to slice through the fat of inefficiency, privatisation has become a limp, cynical, middle-management way of adding the fat of personal insurance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/nov/08/iran-diplomancy-nuclear-solution-us","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-08T15:54:05Z","webTitle":"Iran foreign ministry: diplomacy the only way to solve nuclear tangle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/08/iran-diplomancy-nuclear-solution-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/nov/08/iran-diplomancy-nuclear-solution-us","fields":{"headline":"Iran foreign ministry: diplomacy the only way to solve nuclear tangle","bodyText":"Ahead of the resumption of talks between Iran and six world powers over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme, Iran’s deputy foreign minister said on Saturday his country saw no alternative to a diplomatic settlement and believed both sides were resolved to reach one. The deadline for a deal over Iran’s nuclear programmes is 24 November. Talks – the full version of which involve Iran, the UK, Germany, France, the US, China and Russia – will resume in Oman on Sunday. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, European Union envoy Catherine Ashton and US secretary of state John Kerry will attend, before a full resumption of talks in Vienna on 18 November. “No middle solutions exist and all our thoughts are focused on how to reach a settlement,” Abbas Araghchi, deputy foreign minister and Iran’s chief negotiatior, told the state news agency IRNA. “No one wants to return to the way things were before the Geneva agreement. That would be too risky a scenario,” he said, referring to the preliminary accord reached a year ago under which Iran has curbed some sensitive nuclear activity in exchange for limited relief from international sanctions. However, an influential US thinktank said on Saturday that Iran may have violated last year’s interim agreement by stepping up efforts to develop a machine that could enrich uranium much faster. In Beijing, on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting, Kerry said there was no link between nuclear talks and the US-led fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, and refused to comment on a letter reportedly sent by President Obama to Iran’s religious and political leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suggesting that diplomacy over the nuclear issue might presage a broader rapprochement. The letter, written in October and reported by the Wall Street Journal, reportedly referenced a shared interest between the US and Iran in combating Isis militants. “The nuclear negotiations are on their own, they’re standing separate from anything else, and no discussion has ever taken place about linking one thing to another,” Kerry told reporters. “I’m confident I’m aware of what the president has been doing and saying with respect to this issue.” Kerry said on Wednesday that negotiations would get more difficult if the 24 November deadline were missed, and the powers were not – for now – weighing any extension to the talks. His remarks seemed aimed in part at raising the pressure on Tehran to agree to the deal, which would include tougher United Nations inspections to verify Iran is complying with its provisions. A decade-long standoff over western suspicions that Iran has covertly sought to develop the means to build nuclear weapons – something it denies – has raised the risk of a wider war in the turbulent Middle East. “Both sides are aware of this, which is why I think a deal is within reach. We are serious and I can see the same resolve on the other side,” Araghchi was quoted by IRNA as saying. The stickiest unresolved issues are Iran’s overall uranium enrichment capacity, the length of any long-term agreement and the pace at which international sanctions would be phased out, according to western diplomats involved in the negotiations. Iran says it is enriching uranium solely for a future network of civilian nuclear power stations and to yield isotopes for medical treatments. But if processed much further, refined uranium could be turned into the explosive core of a bomb, which the West fears may be the country’s latent goal. Western officials were not immediately available to comment on an allegation by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security (coincidentally, also known as Isis), which closely tracks Iran’s nuclear programme. There was no immediate comment from Tehran. Isis, whose founder David Albright often briefs US lawmakers and others on nuclear proliferation issues, cited a finding in a new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about Iran. The confidential document, issued to IAEA member states on Friday, said since the UN agency’s previous report in September Iran had “intermittently” been feeding natural uranium gas into a single so-called IR-5 centrifuge at a research facility. The IR-5 is one of several new models that Iran has been seeking to develop to replace the erratic, 1970s vintage IR-1 centrifuge that it now uses to produce refined uranium. But unlike other advanced models under development – IR2m, IR-4 and IR-6 – at a research site at its Natanz enrichment plant, Iran had until now not fed the IR-5 with uranium gas. “Iran may have violated [the interim deal] by starting to feed [natural uranium gas] into one of its advanced centrifuges, namely the IR-5 centrifuge,” Isis said in an analysis of the IAEA report. “Under the interim deal, this centrifuge should not have been fed with [gas] as reported in this safeguards report.” Another Washington-based group, the Arms Control Association, said it did not believe Iran had violated the deal. “The latest IAEA report says clearly that no enriched uranium is being withdrawn from the machine,” the research and advocacy group said in an email. Under last year’s deal with the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain, Iran can continue its “current enrichment R&amp;D [research and development] practices”, language that implies it should not expand them. The text of the publicly released agreement did not elaborate on this point, potentially leaving it open for interpretation. It was one of the thorniest issues to resolve in the negotiations on the temporary accord – which was designed to buy time for talks on a permanent settlement by a 24 November deadline – and is expected to be a key issue also in any long-term deal. Experts say Iran has made limited progress so far in developing new centrifuges. “Because enrichment in these centrifuges is intermittent and not continuous, questions arise whether any of the advanced centrifuges work well,” Isis said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/jun/02/sundays-poll-could-upend-turkish-politics-and-weaken-the-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T15:05:05Z","webTitle":"Why Turkey's elections could upend its politics – the Guardian briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/02/sundays-poll-could-upend-turkish-politics-and-weaken-the-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jun/02/sundays-poll-could-upend-turkish-politics-and-weaken-the-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Why Turkey's elections could upend its politics – the Guardian briefing","bodyText":"What’s happening? Turkey holds its parliamentary elections on Sunday 7 June. In Turkey’s last parliamentary elections, in 2011, 43 million of the country’s 50 million eligible voters came to the polling station. On Sunday, a similar number are predicted to turn out to elect 550 people to form the 25th parliament of Turkey. The parliament is known as the grand national assembly. Turkey is an emerging democracy and has an interesting electoral system, which will be tested during this election. The president is hoping his party will gain a “super-majority” in the parliament, allowing it to make changes to the constitution without holding a referendum, and thus enabling it to introduce stronger presidential powers and change the shape of Turkish politics. What’s the background? Turkey has a president and a prime minster. The prime minister is the leader of whichever party wins a majority in parliamentary elections, such as those being held on the weekend. The president used to be appointed by parliament, but a referendum in 2010 changed that to allow for direct presidential elections, the first of which was held last August and won by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Erdoğan had been, until that point, prime minister of Turkey and leader of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). Erdoğan claims the current parliamentary system is ineffective and is calling for Turkey to move to a strong presidential system of government, which he believes necessary to turn Turkey into a world power. In order to strengthen presidential powers, the ruling party would need to change Turkey’s constitution, which can happen in different ways depending on how many seats the ruling party wins. A party needs to win 276 seats to form a government, but if it wins 330 seats it can call referendums on proposed constitutional changes throughout its rule. If it wins 367 seats – a two-thirds majority – it can change the constitution without calling a referendum, giving the ruling party an enormous amount of power. Despite a constitutional requirement that the president should remain impartial during parliamentary election campaigns, Erdoğan has been touring the country campaigning for the AKP, in the hope that his party will win 367 seats and make the constitutional changes to presidential powers that he would like. In the 2002 parliamentary elections, the AKP won almost 60% of the country’s seats and was just four seats shy of the 367-seat threshold that would have allowed it to make constitutional changes without referendums, despite winning only 34.3% of the vote. The reason for this discrepancy is Turkey’s electoral system, which reallocates the seats won by small parties if they do not receive a certain percentage of the national vote. Erdoğan is hoping this electoral quirk will work in his party’s favour again this year, though polling suggests he will be disappointed, with the AKP predicted to win the election, but not the super-majority Erdoğan is hoping for. How does the voting system work? Turkey is broken into regions that can elect a certain number of MPs based on population. However, Turkey employs the D’Hondt voting system, which requires a party to win a certain percentage of the national vote in order to take up any seats it has won. The D’Hondt method is used in other countries such as Denmark, Spain, Israel, Poland and Russia, but Turkey has the highest threshold of any country in the world, requiring a party to receive 10% of the national vote before any of its elected representatives can enter parliament. What this means is that if a party wins 40 seats but receives only 9.55% of the national vote, as the True Path party (DYP) did in the 2002 Turkish elections, it forfeits those 40 seats, which are then reallocated to larger parties. This system gives larger parties an obvious advantage, as they often end up with bonus seats, allowing the ruling party to increase its parliamentary majority dramatically. To put the Turkish system in context, if a 10% threshold applied in the UK, the current parliament would be made up of Conservative, Labour and Ukip MPs only, with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Greens and all other parties forfeiting their seats. Under the Turkish system, the Conservatives would have gained 28 bonus seats, Labour would have gained 49 and Ukip would have increased the number of seats it won from one to 10. The 10% threshold does not apply to candidates who run as independents, and some parties use this to their advantage. For example, in the 2011 elections the Peace and Democracy party (BDP) received only 5.67% of the vote across the country, but 35 of their members were elected as independents – and then rejoined the BDP after the election. Who are the parties? Founded by politicians of various existing conservative parties in 2001, the Islamicconservative Justice and Development party (AKP) has ruled Turkey since it won in landslide elections in 2002. In the last national elections the party gathered 49.8% of all votes. The former foreign minister Ahmet Davutoğlu became party leader and prime minister after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected as president of Turkey in a popular vote last year. He also stands as the party’s top candidate on 7 June, despite his often criticised and only thinly veiled support for the AKP, when as president he should be impartial. One main target for the AKP is to win a twothirds majority – or 367 seats in parliament – in order to change the current constitution and introduce an executive presidential system without a referendum. This seems to have become an unattainable goal. While it is pretty much certain that the AKP will emerge as the winner from the elections, recent polls suggest that they might lose up to 10 points – which would put a referendum, for which the party needs a three fifths majority, or 330 seats, out of reach. The AKP faces a number of serious challenges in this year’s elections. Internally the party is more divided than ever before. Furthermore, an important number of AKP voters show little support for the party’s executive presidency plans. Foreign policy troubles, a stalling economy and the government’s increasing authoritarianism might drive an important number of former AKP voters to cast their ballots for one of the opposition parties. Established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, in 1923, the Republican People’s party (CHP) is the oldest party and represents the main opposition. The party leader and its top candidate is Kemal Kiliçdaroglu. In the last parliamentary elections, the CHP was able to garner 25.98% of all votes. The CHP’s election manifesto is centred on economic and labour issues: the party promises to introduce higher pensions, to tackle the current unemployment rate of 11.2%, and to improve employment among young people. It also promises to increase the minimum wage from 950 lira (£235) to 1,500 lira a month, whereas the work week is not to exceed 40 hours. The CHP supports the reform of the current constitution, introduced by the military junta after the 1980 military coup, but opposes the AKP’s plans of an executive presidency. The CHP is the only party that organised primaries for the candidates standing in the 7 June elections and the election manifesto was written over a period of eight months and in cooperation with unions, trade chambers and other civil society groups. While the party has certainly changed under its current leader, many voters, especially Kurds and the religiously conservative, still distrust the CHP as a dogmatic and elitist party, making an election victory highly unlikely. The far-right Nationalist Movement party (MHP), informally known as the Grey Wolves, will likely retain its place as the third largest group in the Turkish parliament. In 2011, the party got 13.01% of all votes, and runs again under the leadership of Devlet Bahçeli. While the MHP supports a certain degree of Kurdish and minority rights – the party promises in its manifesto that Cemeviler, Alevi houses of worship, will receive state support – they are against the peace process between the government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), arguing that the Kurds need to accept the authority of the Turkish state. They promise to end all ongoing negotiations should they come to power. Therefore the MHP draws their support mainly from a non-Kurdish base and is likely to generate MPs in all major Turkish cities. The MHP is expected to improve their vote count this year but has no traditional stronghold anywhere in the country. Polls suggest they will take votes both from the ruling AKP as well as from the main opposition CHP, from Turks who do not agree with the peace negotiations or who long for a return to more Turkish-nationalist government policies. Lately both Erdoğan and AKP candidates have criticised Kurdish politicians and the peace process in campaign speeches, well aware that the MHP might eat into their nationalist voter base. Often described as Turkey’s answer to Greece’s Syriza and the Spain’s Podemos, the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP) arguably has the highest stakes in this year’s national elections. In order to enter parliament after 7 June, it will have to garner at least 10% of the national vote to get over the election threshold. Should it succeed, it will secure at least 50 seats, but if it fails all of these seats will go to the other parties and might hand the AKP a huge majority. Founded in 2012 and led by chairman Selahattin Demirtaş and chairwoman Figen Yüksekdag, this democratic-socialist party will stand the first time as a party. In 2011 the HDP’s MPs stood as independent candidates since Turkey’s election threshold of 10% only applies to political parties. It is the only political party in Turkey that has a 50% women’s quota. The HDP centres its election programme on minority rights, the rights of women and LGBTs and aspires to end ethnic, religious and gender discrimination. The party promises to drive forward the Kurdish peace process and to introduce mother-tongue education. It also plans to abolish obligatory (Sunni) religious lessons in schools in favour of electives that correspond with pupils’ religious beliefs. The HDP describes itself as an environmentalist and anti-capitalist party that opposes nuclear power and vows to improve workers’ rights. What are the issues? An Ipsos poll conducted earlier this year found that the most significant issue for Turkish voterswas the condition of the economy, closely followed by unemployment. The AKP has campaigned strongly on these issues, claiming credit for the financial growth experienced by Turkey, which is now the world’s 17th-largest economy. The CHP, however, claims that the financial growth Turkey has experienced has led to greater inequality between rich and poor and has pledged, if elected, to tackle youth unemployment, which sits around 20%. A key issue in the campaign is rights for the 14 million Kurdish people in Turkey. The AKP originally promised they would increase rights for Kurds by establishing Kurdish-language media and university departments, but the party seems to have changedits mind on these issues, with Erdoğan claiming earlier in the campaign that there was “no longer a Kurdish problem”. The AKP’s refusal to engage on Kurdish issues could see it lose support and bleed seats to the pro-Kurdish BDP. Both main parties have promised that, if elected with a sufficient majority, they will make changes to Turkey’s constitution, which was written in 1982 by the military leaders who ruled Turkey. The AKP promises a completely new constitution, focused on the individual and freedom, though opponents fear the changes are to consolidate Erdoğan’s power. The CHP promises to change the constitution to introduce press freedoms - Turkey is currently ranked 148th in the world for journalistic freedom by Reporters Without Borders - a reduction in the electoral threshold to 3% and greater rights for minority ethnic groups.

Half of the big six energy firms have already abandoned their nuclear plans as too costly, but Hinkley is backed by the most pro-nuclear of them, EDF, which is 83% owned by the French state. Replacing the UK's ageing nuclear plants is central to coalition plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions while keeping the lights on. EDF was seen as the most committed company, with France getting 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Reports of rising reactor costs and the election of François Hollande as French president, with promises to cut back on nuclear power, have dented confidence. UK energy company bosses have stressed the need for ministers to ensure planned energy market reforms, set out in the Queen's speech, make building nuclear power stations an attractive investment. Work to move millions of cubic metres of soil and rock at the Hinkley site was due to begin in August, according to West Somerset council's planning department. But EDF staff have been told the work will now start in 2013. Crispin Aubrey of the Stop Hinkley campaign said: \"This is very good news. We've always argued that it's appalling vandalism to destroy more than 400 acres of Somerset countryside before they even have permission to construct the proposed reactors. This is yet another sign that the UK's dangerous nuclear enterprise is stumbling.\" EDF is expected to get the government's go-ahead to build the reactors within the next year. \"We aim to start the earthworks as soon as practicable and all necessary steps are being taken to ensure that work can start in good time,\" said an EDF spokesman. Some preparatory work had begun since planning permission was granted in February, he said, including cutting hedges and demolishing old buildings. Internally, EDF blamed the delay on cost overruns on the preparatory work. One source involved in the project told the Guardian the work so far had been a \"farce\". The £100m earthworks contracts were awarded to construction companies Keir and BAM Nuttall in February, days after David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy agreed a wide-ranging nuclear power deal. Both firms declined to comment on the delay. The delay comes at a highly sensitive time as EDF and other companies negotiate with the government over the financial support that will be available to nuclear and other low-carbon energy sources, such as wind and solar power. On Friday, the chief executive of Centrica, which has a 20% stake in EDF's nuclear plans, issued a warning to ministers. \"The investment case for nuclear has yet to be proven,\" Sam Laidlaw told investors. Earlier, EDF's chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said: \"It is absolutely critical that the government continues to make steady, tangible progress with its electricity market reform plans.\" EDF has been criticised as being too close to government, providing full-time staff to work within the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Energy minister Charles Hendry will be questioned by MPs on the nuclear challenge on Tuesday. A DECC spokeswoman said: \"It is for energy companies to construct, operate and decommission nuclear power stations. EDF's application for development consent for the nuclear power station itself envisages operations starting in 2019.\" \"The flagship nuclear project in Britain is now surrounded with confusion and is going nowhere fast,\" said Doug Parr, Greenpeace chief scientist. \"It's time for the government to admit that the economics of nuclear power just don't stack up. Only blank cheques from the taxpayer will keep the show on the road.\" The cost of the two nuclear plants EDF intends to build in Somerset was reported last week to have risen by 40% to £7bn each. Peter Atherton, an influential energy analyst at Citigroup, said in a report: \"If construction costs are indeed anything like that, then an already very challenging programme may be reaching the point of impossibility.\" An EDF spokesman said: \"Information about costs will be made public in due course, taking account of all the relevant factors. We remain committed to delivering the first new nuclear plants in the UK for 20 years at Hinkley Point. The decision depends on having the correct market framework that will allow an appropriate return on the massive investment required.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/oct/22/first-look-environmental-entrepreneur-paul-hawkens-long-awaited-new-book","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-22T14:17:00Z","webTitle":"First look: environmental entrepreneur Paul Hawken's long-awaited new book","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/22/first-look-environmental-entrepreneur-paul-hawkens-long-awaited-new-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/22/first-look-environmental-entrepreneur-paul-hawkens-long-awaited-new-book","fields":{"headline":"First look: environmental entrepreneur Paul Hawken's long-awaited new book","bodyText":"Ten years ago, in a landmark article in Science Magazine, Princeton professors Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow wrote, “Humanity can solve the carbon and climate problem in the first half of this century simply by scaling up what we already know how to do.” They identified a series of so-called climate stabilization wedges – among them efficient cars and buildings, increasing solar, wind and nuclear power, and reducing deforestation – that if adopted would eventually maintain atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at about 500 parts per million (ppm), a level they said “would prevent most damaging climate change.” At the time, atmospheric concentrations stood at about 375 ppm. A decade later, annual emissions continue to grow and atmospheric concentrations have topped 395 ppm – and they are rising steadily. The situation appears grim. It is not, argues pioneering environmentalist, entrepreneur and author Paul Hawken. Climate solutions abound, he said, and today, at the opening plenary of the big Greenbuild conference in New Orleans, he will unveil Project Drawdown – a new compendium of climate solutions that are designed not just to stabilize, but to reduce the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “Stabilization at 450, 500, 550 ppm is chaos,” Hawken said. “Our goal should be drawdown.” Project Drawdown will begin as a lavishly illustrated book and online database, to be released late next year. Its purpose is to re-frame the climate debate, by showing that solving the climate crisis will bring, not sacrifice, but “more security, more prosperity, more jobs, more well-being and better health,” Hawken said. “Drawdown is about technologies and solutions that are in place, understood, measured, documented and growing,” Hawken told me by phone. “This is a path to opportunity and wellbeing, as opposed to a tax or a loss.” Ordinarily, the announcement of a new book would not by itself be newsworthy, but Hawken has had so much influence over corporate sustainability in the US that his work merits attention. His books, The Ecology of Commerce and Natural Capitalism, the latter written with Amory Lovins and L Hunter Lovins, were among the first to point the way towards a sustainable global economy. He has advised CEOs at Ford, Walmart and Interface, the carpet company. At Greenbuild, which attracts 23,000 people, he’ll interview billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer and Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, key allies in the climate debate. But as I asked Hawken: Don’t we know what to do about climate change? The climate wedges are, after all, alive and well at what is now the Carbon Mitigation Initiative at Princeton, where they’ve even been made into a board game. The problem with the wedges, Hawken replied, is that their solutions tend to be technology-driven and some “are not practiced, affordable or running,” like capturing carbon from coal plants, which is expensive, or extracting hydrogen gas from coal.” “They were almost all top down,” Hawken said, “and a lot of them could only be accomplished by big utilities and energy companies. It was, like, wow, does our fate rest in the hands of these boards of directors? It was not an empowering document. It made me pessimistic.” By contrast, Project Drawdown will encompass a broader set of solutions and include those that can be carried out by individuals, communities, building owners, companies and local governments. It aims to inspire as well as inform. As Amanda Ravenhill, the executive director of Project Drawdown put it: “We’re trying to say the solutions are everywhere – sometimes in surprising places.” Businesses, for example, can invest in video conferencing technology to reduce travel. Ranchers can adopt rotational grazing, which stores carbon in soil. LED lights for homes and offices are ten times more efficient than incandescent bulbs, and increasingly affordable. Educating girls is not ordinarily seen as a climate strategy, but a draft of the book notes that, with seven or more years of education, a girl in the developing world will marry four years later and have 2.2 fewer children. Fewer people means fewer emissions and, of course, educating girls has incalculable other benefits. For each technology, Project Drawdown will calculate upfront costs and savings over time, climate benefits and other advantages and obstacles, drawing from the best academic research. The project has a long list of prestigious partners and advisers. A number of companies, including Interface and Autodesk, have signed up to back Project Drawdown, either directly or through their foundations. Others are enthusiastic. Rao Mulpuri is the chief executive of View, which makes dynamic, intelligent glass for windows – a potential climate solution. “Much like transition sunglasses, it adjusts the condition of the window glass based on location, angle of the sun, cloud cover, inside and outside temperature,” Mulpuri told me. “It’s a giant smart skin for the building.” Smart glass costs more than conventional glass, of course, but it reduces heating, cooling and lighting costs in a typical commercial building by 20%, he said. More important, he said, “We can elevate the quality of life and feeling of well-being.” View glass has been sold to office buildings, schools, hospitals and hotels. Hawken said that the crowd at Greenbuild understands the climate opportunity as well as leaders of any industry. They’ve seen the rapid growth in efficient building technology, LEDs and solar power. “We’re waging an incredible effort” to curb global warming, and it deserves a brighter spotlight, he said. “The idea is to really change the zeitgeist around climate change.” The sustainable living hub is funded by Unilever.

In the first paper, a UK-wide team of expert academics retracted their earlier warnings that an independent Scotland would be unable to afford to hit its target for 100% renewable electricity by 2020 without substantial UK subsidies. In a serious blow to Ed Davey, the UK energy secretary, the academics said because of the energy market reforms and the hefty subsidy for new nuclear power, Scotland's consumers would get cheaper electricity if it had an entirely independent energy policy without UK subsidies. In the second report, economists at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) challenged claims that Scotland's economy would suffer after independence because its population is ageing more rapidly than the UK's, putting a greater burden on public spending. NIESR said the analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) last month had over-estimated the financial impact of an ageing population, as Scotland would need to bear those costs regardless of independence. While Scotland would be worse off, the overall burden of ageing would be only slightly greater and would be manageable. It stated: \"This difference should not be a major consideration when taking the decision about independence.\" The first report by five academics from the universities of Cardiff and Birmingham, Queens in Belfast and Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen had warned that Scotland's green energy revolution would be unaffordable without UK subsidy – a position shared by investment banks. But Dr David Toke – an expert in energy politics who worked on the report while based at the University of Birmingham but is now based at the University of Aberdeen – said that since then the UK government's new energy policies had significantly changed the economics of energy investment for Scotland. The extra subsidy given to nuclear power – which is being guaranteed for 35 years – and the cuts in offshore wind and marine energy subsidies meant it that would be cheaper over 20 years for Scottish consumers to go it alone. Toke said their new findings actually contradicted the proposals in Salmond's white paper on independence last week, which called for the continuation of a UK-wide energy market and continued UK subsidy of Scottish renewables investment after independence. Toke said that by 2018 this would not be necessary, since Scotland would have met about 67% of that 100% green electricity target by then, greatly reducing the necessity for hefty UK subsidy of new investment. Scottish consumers would pay lower subsidies if it was not tied into the UK system, so Scotland should actually seek greater independence on electricity policy, not less. \"We don't fully understand what the white paper is trying to get at,\" Toke said. \"I see it as a negotiating position: it's not a final structure. A final structure is either going to be complete consolidation or independence, and I think it's more likely to result in independence because they're going to get a better deal that way.\" There was a contradiction in the Scottish government's proposals because having a UK-Scotland deal on energy co-operation after independence meant Scotland would be helping fund new nuclear power while having a policy opposing new nuclear investment. He added: \"I can't see how the Scottish government is going to work in reality because they can't have it both ways. They can't not pay for nuclear power and then [expect to] get the renewables incentives under the same contract.\" Tom Greatrex, Labour's shadow energy minister at Westminster, said Toke was now ignoring his previous report's evidence that Scotland's renewables investment was heavily dependent on UK subsidy. Scottish power firms get a third of overall UK support for renewables despite having 8.5% of the UK population, so after independence electricity bills would soar or investment would need to be cut. \"This confusion seems to run right through the report. It is highly misleading, cherry-picking statistics and twisting the facts to produce an image of a separate Scotland that is far from realistic,\" Greatrex said. In its report on an ageing Scotland, the NIESR analysis, which used different models and population data than the IFS, said that at its worst the extra burden on Scottish finances would be about 1.4% more on average income tax in 2035. The authors, Katerina Lisenkova of NIESR and Marcel Mérette at the University of Ottawa, calculate that the costs of Scotland's old age population would be greater than the UK's from 2022 until 2060. The pro-UK Better Together campaign said NIESR had pointed out that Scotland's economy would be heavily influenced still by North Sea oil income, borrowing costs and the wider economy. But on the single issue of old age, NIESR concluded: \"The difference is non-negligible, but is much smaller than the overall effect of population ageing itself.\" • This article was amended on 5 December 2013. The earlier version stated that Dr Toke had said that Scotland would have met about 67% of its 100% green electricity target by 2016. Also, the picture caption on the earlier version described Dr David Toke as \"senior lecturer in energy policy at the University of Birmingham\"; the article itself, which did not say which institution he was with, has been amended to clarify that he worked on the report while at Birmingham but is now at the University of Aberdeen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/aug/03/ttip-what-why-angry-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-guide","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-03T17:15:52Z","webTitle":"What is TTIP and why should we be angry about it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/ttip-what-why-angry-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-guide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/aug/03/ttip-what-why-angry-transatlantic-trade-investment-partnership-guide","fields":{"headline":"What is TTIP and why should we be angry about it?","bodyText":"“Sometimes,” says a character in David Foster Wallace’s novel The Pale King, “what’s important is dull. Sometimes it’s work. Sometimes the important things aren’t works of art for your entertainment.” It is worth bearing that in mind as we consider TTIP, the most boring thing we’re supposed to get angry about since – ooh … was it PFI schemes that nobbled hospitals, eviscerated schools and left Britain £222bn in debt? Or was it the asymmetrical constitutional ramifications inherent in the West Lothian question? Or George Osborne’s incomprehensible pension changes involving auto-enrolment annuities, tax wrappers, pots and draw-downs? Christine Lagarde’s last press conference about the Greek debt crisis? Maybe it was your last mobile phone bill. Add up the boredom you experienced on each of those occasions, multiply the result by the international coefficient of tedium (which, as you know, is 27.5) and that’s how bored the international trade deal known as TTIP will make you. The Guardian’s expert on obfuscation by bureaucratese and acronym, Steven Poole, recently argued that TTIP could be a conspiracy to pull some very thick wool over our eyes. We live in an age when we’re so accustomed to being entertained that we haven’t the temperament to do the difficult work of penetrating the wool of boring. So we’re going to take that wool, roll it into a ball and leave it for the cat to play with. No, don’t look at the cat. Look at me. Focus. So, what is TTIP? Remember when acronyms starting with two TTs were lovely things such as TTFN (ta-ta for now)? TTIP isn’t like that. It stands for Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Last month, the European parliament voted to allow the European commission to continue negotiations with the United States to create the world’s largest free-trade zone, which is what TTIP is all about. Conservative trade spokesman Emma McClarkin said: “I welcome the fact that, following weeks of parliamentary ping-pong and attempts by socialist and protectionist MEPs to derail the process, we finally have a clear backing for TTIP.” Right, stop thinking how much fun parliamentary ping-pong sounds, particularly if a cat joins in. What McClarkin is looking forward to is greater regulatory harmonisation and a consequent boost for business, some of it, incredibly, British. Today, for instance, the US and EU have different regulations testing the safety of cars, drugs and soft furnishings. That imposes costs on transatlantic exporters of cars, drugs and soft furnishings – especially, you would think, on exporters of upholstery for drug dealers’ cars. One possible consequence of harmonisation could be a boost for British car exports. Imagine: one day Americans will be driving trim little Nissans made in Sunderland rather than ludicrous Hummers concocted in the bowels of hell. There are other projected benefits. US ambassador to the EU Anthony L Gardner argues that TTIP is, if you’ll pardon the expression, geopolitically pertinent, and that it would “provide an economic equivalent to Nato” that would settle “the rules of world trade before others do it for us”. Think about it this way: right now, Vladimir Putin can, if he chooses, strip to the waist for a photo op in which he turns off the gas pipe from Russia to Europe. That’s not good enough. Instead of being dependent on nasty Russian gas and oil, then, as a result of TTIP, the EU might become dependent on lovely American and Canadian gas and oil. That’s one reason behind the EU’s call for a dedicated chapter in TTIP on energy and raw materials. Instead of Russia isolating the EU, the EU could isolate Russia. Sweet. We have been invited to pronounce TTIP “tea tip”. Don’t these knuckleheads have any sense of history? The world’s most famous tea tip was in Boston in 1773, and that resulted in the marvellous era of transatlantic cooperation known as the American War of Independence. TTIP is not to be confused with TPP, which is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving 12 countries including the US, Australia and Brunei, and which, like TTIP, is still under negotiation. There is also, incidentally, something called Ceta, which stands for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. It is like TTIP but for Canada and Europe and, so far as I understand it, means that Europeans will soon bathing in maple syrup while reading Margaret Atwood novels. Which is probably nicer than it sounds. Ceta is due to be ratified by the European parliament later this year but the document is currently undergoing a process of what is called “legal scrubbing”, which sounds like the sort of thing Americans do to their chickens, but in fact is another species of the kind of gobbledegook rampant in modern life and means minimising the document’s exposure to legal action. But that’s not all. There is also Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was established in 1994 and, proponents of TTIP think, demonstrates the kind of inspiring benefits and harmonisation of standards that might result if TTIP comes into force. Think of it this way. Just as, thanks to Nafta, for the past 21 years Americans have been saying “aboot” and forming their own mariachi bands, Mounties have been wearing sombreros and Mexicans putting maple syrup on their quesadillas, so in the future, thanks to TTIP, Americans might drink coffee from cups the size of thimbles, while Europeans might wear 10-gallon hats even though, on average, we’ve only got six-gallon-sized heads and so would look ridiculous. But seriously. How is TTIP going to affect me? TTIP will hit Europeans like you in the pocket, critics argue, so you need to pay attention. While the European commission estimates that, by 2027, TTIP could boost the size of the EU economy by £94bn or 0.5% of GDP, an economic study by Jeronim Capaldo of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University argues that the commission’s econometric modelling is jejune and that, in fact, TTIP will clobber Europeans. Capaldo predicts 600,000 European job losses as a result of TTIP, a net fall in EU exports, declining GDPs for EU member states and a fall in Europeans’ personal income. Why people are so angry about TTIP? Because Americans are, with all due respect, disgusting slobs always chasing a fast buck and thus very different from us fragrant Europeans who are, like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way. One worry is that the main goal of TTIP is to remove EU regulations that stop its citizens being poisoned, killed or subject to rampant pollution so that more profits can be made by corporations on both sides of the Atlantic. For instance, critics argue that if TTIP involves, as the EU hopes, a commitment that would guarantee automatic licences for all future US crude oil and gas exports to Europe, that would result in a boom in US fracking to keep Europeans powered with shale gas, not to mention greater exploitation of oil from Canadian tar sands. Such developments, argue critics, would undermine not just the EU’s fuel quality directive but ruin what is left of the planet worth ruining. Consider one aspect of TTIP that is giving European critics the particular pip. It involves another acronym, so steel yourselves. That acronym is ISDS, which stands for “investor-state dispute settlement”. This procedure would allow companies to sue foreign governments over claims of unfair treatment and to be entitled to compensation. Similar provisions in other treaties have allowed, for example, tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris to sue Uruguay and Australia for enacting anti-smoking legislation, and a Swedish energy company to take legal action against Germany for phasing out nuclear power. Critics say ISDS provisions undermine the power of national governments to act in the interests of their citizens. According to John Hilary, the executive director of War on Want, leaked documents show that medical and health services, social services, education, post, finance, telecommunications, transport, energy, water, environmental and cultural services are all on the table in TTIP, meaning that American corporations may have full access to them. That is why there is a big banner outside the US embassy in Berlin that says (try saying this in the whiniest German voice you can muster): “Demokratie ist keine Handelsware,” which means democracy is not for trading.. Of course there is. It is also why there is some unacceptably unfunny graffiti in Malmö that depicts Barack Obama grinning oleaginously as a wooden horse marked TTIP is dragged into Europe. In the UK, there are fears that ISDS could threaten the NHS because it might allow private firms running hospital services to sue the government if it chose to return the services to the public sector. The French government has already negotiated its film industry’s exemption from these provisions, so why can’t the NHS be, critics ask? But the idea that ISDS is subverting democracy in favour of wicked corporations is a conspiracy theory, argues the European Policy Information Center, which – unforgivably – is already spelling “centre” the American way. Epicenter (as this group is acronymically known) is made up of groups, such as the UK’s Institute of Economic Affairs, that are in favour of TTIP. It argues that we shouldn’t worry about ISDS provisions. Why? Because the clause is a time-honoured means whereby corporations protect their investments, and does not undermine EU or member states’ right to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Or consider food regulations. While the EU has an impressively alliterative “farm to fork” strategy, for instance, regulating each link in the food chain, Americans pump their cattle and pigs with growth-promoting hormones banned in the EU. As a result, most US beef can’t be sold in the EU. Worse, Americans use 82 pesticides banned in the EU. They wash their chicken in chlorinated water to kill bacteria. Ninety per cent of their soya, cotton and corn is genetically modified, while the EU allows member states to ban GM production. France, for instance, has banned GM, and Gauloises-smoking, beret-wearing toughs now patrol French fields to ensure that the excrescence of GM never sullies la belle France again. So how could we possibly abandon these glorious European standards? The spectre of what lavishly moustachioed French farmer/anti-globalisation activist José Bové calls la malbouffe Americaine (rubbish American food) lurks behind the fears of this trading alliance. “Yeah?” retort Americans. “So how come you dumbass Europeans got mired in a horse-meat scandal in 2013 if your food regulations are so darn tootin’?” Which, you have to admit, is a good comeback. Or consider data privacy rights. Don’t Americans realise that us Europeans don’t care to be snooped on by the NSA or have Google peer 24/7 into our very souls? MEPs are worried that TTIP might undermine EU data protection laws, and that’s why they have called for an “unambiguous, horizontal, self-standing provision” in it to guarantee citizens’ right to privacy. Can something be horizontal and self-standing at the same time, you ask? It seems, I concede, unlikely. Who is angry about TTIP? Groups as disparate as War on Want and Ukip are united in anger about TTIP, though for different reasons. The Institute of Economic Affairs and the Conservative party are united in not being angry. The Labour party is – surprise! – conflicted. Let’s consider Labour first. Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling, while arguing that ISDS is a “para-judicial and opaque system of private arbitration [that] allows companies to sue governments at great cost to the taxpayer”, also says that TTIP “could present us with a unique chance to regulate globalisation and to promote EU standards”, as well as “providing a much-needed boost to local economies, support to SMEs and new and exciting jobs and training opportunities”. As for Ukip, Farage and his chums oppose TTIP because they think it’s a smokescreen. It’s not about trade, stupid, it’s about promoting “the political pretensions of a wannabe European superstate” and “setting up a parallel system that undermines national courts and national legal systems”, as the party’s international trade spokesman William Dartmouth MEP said in the European parliament last month. After the vote went against Ukip’s stance last week, Dartmouth said that the only way citizens can defeat TTIP now is to vote to leave the European Union. But that’s Ukip’s answer to everything. As for War on Want, its views are more typical of the pressure groups, unions, charities, NGOs and environmentalists that oppose TTIP. There are, for example, 480 such groups affiliated to the Berlin-based Stop TTIP campaign, whose supporting organisations include trade unions like the NUT, NGOs such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace and, my personal favourite, the Pirate Parties of Greece, Germany, Slovenia and the Netherlands, which have no leaders but a splendid flag. The campaign has a 2.3 million-signature petition calling on the EU to “stop these sinister trade deals”, by which it means both TTIP and CETA. One of War On Want’s major concerns is that TTIP is being negotiated in secret. And with good cause: what nobody seems to have pointed out yet is that if TTIP negotiations do continue, as expected, until next year at the earliest, often in secret with (I suspect) all sorts of complicated car switcheroos, dead letter drops and tooled-up security johnnies in shades talking furtively into their wrists, the costs of negotiations might outweigh any supposed benefits of what they’re negotiating about. But are TTIP negotiations being conducted in secret? Giacomo Lev Mannheimer of Istituto Bruno Leoni argues that is another conspiracy theory. And, indeed, he points to the dismal truth that there are lots and lots and lots of TTIP-related documents about its benefits, impact on public services, food and agriculture rules. Mannheimer makes a good point, though critics argue that the real meat of negotiations takes place elsewhere and ordinary European citizens don’t get a say in them. What Mannheimer doesn’t consider is the more disturbing truth that there is an inverse relationship between the number of funny videos on YouTube and the user traffic on European commission websites relating to TTIP. Indeed, if TTIP is about liberalising the parameters of boring, there are some of us who are prepared to fight back. And when I say “fight back”, I mean kick back on a sofa watching kittens get tickled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2014/oct/03/met-office-space-weather-forecast","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-03T18:14:44Z","webTitle":"Met Office launches space weather forecasting service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/oct/03/met-office-space-weather-forecast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2014/oct/03/met-office-space-weather-forecast","fields":{"headline":"Met Office launches space weather forecasting service","bodyText":"After a bright start to the morning, the day will turn gloomy as the solar wind lashes Britain with energetic particles and an enormous ball of magnetised plasma slams into Earth bringing a few days of geomagnetic storms. The day when weather bulletins might be like that moves a little closer next week when the Met Office’s space weather forecasting service will make its public debut with the official opening of the UK’s Space Weather Operations Centre in Exeter. There is a growing need for the information and, from next week, the outlook from the edge of space will be publicly available on the Met Office website. A full suite of forecasts, alerts and warnings will appear – informing viewers of impending aurorae, solar flares and potentially damaging events such as coronal mass ejections – hefty eruptions of magnetised plasma that can take days to reach Earth but carry the power to knock out power grids when they arrive. Space weather is an umbrella term for the subatomic particles and electromagnetic energy that reaches Earth from the sun. The solar wind is a stream of particles, mostly protons and electrons, that waxes and wanes with the sun’s activity. Solar flares are sudden bursts of electromagnetic waves that travel across space at the speed of light. Together with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), they can disrupt radio communications, damage satellites, cause electronics and GPS systems to go awry, and produce such high levels of radiation that aircraft must fly lower to shield themselves, or reroute to avoid riskier polar regions. “There’s no doubt that the impact of space weather is becoming ever more important the more reliant we become on technology,” said Catherine Burnett, the Met Office’s space weather programme manager. Developed on the back of £4.6m from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills last year, the national space weather forecasting system has provided early warnings of extreme space weather for the past six months to government and key organisations such as the national grid. The potential threat from solar activity was hardly on the government’s radar until the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland grounded scores of planes and left thousands of passengers stranded. The crisis prompted a rethink of natural hazards that might affect the nation. A year later, space weather was added to the UK’s national risk register. To provide the service, the Met Office has partnered with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which has an established space weather prediction centre in Colorado. Under the arrangement, Met Office experts will pore over images and solar activity data recorded by UK and US satellites and ground-based instruments. The Met Office has adopted Noaa’s cutting-edge space weather model, WSA-ENLIL, to calculate risk levels for different space weather events. “We’ll be analysing sun spots to see how complex they are,” said Chris Bulmer, a Met Office space weather forecaster. “We know that certain sunspot groups are very unlikely to produce coronal mass ejections, whereas others are highly likely to. So we can forecast an elevated risk of a big solar flare or one of these CMEs happening.” Space weather prediction is not a mature science. While forecasters might see a coronal mass ejection lift off the sun and head for Earth, its potential to cause damage can only be ascertained by one satellite that can give 20 to 30 minutes’ notice. It is the clash of the CME’s magnetic field with Earth’s that causes geomagnetic storms. According to Bulmer, the state-of-the-art in space weather forecasting is where normal weather forecasting was around 20 to 30 years ago. In part, the lag comes down to technology and the need for more multimillion dollar satellites to study the sun. Though Met Office space weather forecasts will first appear as written reports illustrated with pictures of solar activity, the organisation has an eye on forecasts fronted by a presenter who speaks to an enormous map of the sun. “We are experimenting with how it might look if Chris stood in front of a green screen and did a space weather forecast,” Burnett said. But a major unknown is whether the British public’s fascination with weather will extend beyond the atmosphere. Space weather is technical and unfamiliar to most people. The implications of events can be unclear. Does an imminent proton pulse or persistent fluctuations of Earth’s magnetic field call for an umbrella, wellies or a foil hat? “We’ll be limited in what we show because people’s understanding is generally quite low compared with their understanding of terrestrial weather. We’ll be very much focused on showing the potential impacts,” Burnett said. Extreme space weather events have caused disruption on rare occasions in the past. In 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused knocked out a power grid in Quebec, leaving six million people without electricity for nine hours. The same storm damaged a transformer in the Salem nuclear power plant in New Jersey, and two transformers on the UK grid. Astronauts on the Apollo 16 and 17 missions in April and December 1972 respectively came close to being exposed to severe levels of radiation from high energy protons released when three solar flares erupted on the sun in August that year. In the Halloween solar storms in 2003, the crew on the International Space Station was forced to take shelter in a shielded compartment until the radiation risk had passed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-08T15:35:12Z","webTitle":"Justine Greening responds to urgent Commons question on grammar schools - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/08/grammar-schools-theresa-may-plans-for-inclusive-grammar-schools-slammed-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Justine Greening responds to urgent Commons question on grammar schools - Politics live","bodyText":"The Scottish National party has criticised the plan to spend £4bn renovating parliament because the option of moving the Commons into a brand new alternative building has not been considered. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, said: The report on the restoration of the Houses of Parliament lacks credibility. It does not put all options on the table - it does not consider a new build parliament when it must scrutinise all possible options - and it is based on figures which were proposed in 2014. The UK government will effectively be asking taxpayers to pay a Westminster premium to crowbar a modern parliament into a Victorian building at a time of austerity when Tory policy is hitting some of the poorest in society, and political uncertainty when this UK government has no plan for the UK outside the European Union. Today’s report publication is just the start of the process, parliament and the public now have the opportunity to debate whether spending billions of pounds to keep parliament in a palace is the right thing to do, when it is clearly not a good use of taxpayer’s money. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has announced that the autumn statement will take place on Wednesday 23 November. Guy Verhofstad, the former Belgian prime minister, has been appointed lead Brexit negotiator for the European parliament, as the other 27 EU member states gear up for the complex negotiations ahead. That’s all from me for now. Later I will be covering Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith at the BBC Question Time hustings on a new blog. The programme starts at 9pm, and I will launch the blog at about 8.30pm. You will be able to find it here. The New Statesman’s Stephen Bush has written a good blog about grammar schools. He says it will be particularly interesting to see what Michael Gove, the former education secretary, says about Theresa May’s proposals. Here’s an extract. The re-creation of grammar schools is a significant repudiaton for the Gove agenda that every school should achieve excellence, and if the former Secretary of State lends his voice, that will embolden MPs on the Conservative left to vote against the measure. Gove’s incentive to do so would be personal as well as political. There is no love lost between he and May, who as well as disagreeing on substantial matters of policy have wildly divergent approaches to politics. But – and this is one of the wider difficulties for the Osborne-Gove tendency, purged en masse when May put her government together – although being defeated over grammar schools won’t have anyone opening the champagne in Number 10, being the architect of that loss would near-certainly bring about the end of Gove’s slim hopes of a return to the top table of politics. The Sutton Trust, the social mobility education thinktank, has released a briefing paper on grammar schools. Here is an extract. Less than 3% of entrants to grammar schools are entitled to free school meals – an important indicator of social deprivation – whereas almost 13% of entrants come from outside the state sector, largely believed to be fee-paying preparatory schools. The average proportion of pupils entitled to free school meals in selective areas was 18% when the research was done, and is higher on average in other areas (those without fully selective systems) where grammar schools are located. By contrast, just over 6% of 10-year olds are enrolled in independent fee-paying schools nationally. The research also shows that in local authorities that operate the grammar system, children who are not eligible for free school meals have a much greater chance of attending a grammar school than similarly high achieving children (as measured by their Key Stage 2 test scores) who are eligible for free school meals. For example, in selective local authorities, 66% of children who achieve level 5 in both English and Maths at Key Stage 2 who are not eligible for free school meals go to a grammar school compared with 40% of similarly high achieving children who are eligible for free school meals. The Commons education committee has announced that it will take evidence from Justine Greening, the education secretary, next Wednesday. Neil Carmichael, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: The new secretary of state has joined a department with increased responsibilities and which is already engaged in an ambitious and challenging programme of reforms. As a committee, we will press the secretary of state on her views on the role and potential expansion of grammar schools but also pick up on a wide range of issues facing schools, further education, higher education, and children’s services. My colleague Sally Weale has written an analysis looking at whether it is possible to have inclusive grammar schools. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is currently giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. He has just announced that the autumn statement will take place on Wednesday 23 November. When Theresa May was in China a photograph was published (above) showing her at a summit meeting alongside a confident-looking chap with a long beard. An uninformed person looking at the picture may have concluded that he was in charge and that the woman beside him (Theresa May) was some sort of aide. His name is Nick Timothy, he is May’s co-chief of staff and, on the basis of today’s grammar school news, you could be forgiven for thinking he is running the country. Timothy used to be May’s chief of staff when she was home secretary and during that period he did not have a media profile. But then he left to work as head of the New Schools Network and, during that time, he spoke to the media and wrote a regular (and very good) column for ConservativeHome, which means we know a great deal about what he thinks. Two of the most surprising announcements to come from May since she became prime minister can be directly traced to his thinking. The last-minute decision to delay agreeing the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station? Timothy set out the thinking behind that in a ConservativeHome column last October, The Government is selling our national security to China. And extending grammar schools? Timothy proposed exactly that in an interview with the Daily Telegraph last November. So what else in on Timothy’s agenda? Here are five policies that he is likely to be pushing, based on what he has said in the past. 1 - Introducing tighter curbs on student visas. (Timothy wrote about that here.) 2 - Making it easier for faith schools to expand. In a ConservativeHome article Timothy wrote: The government should abolish its admissions rule for faith-designated free schools – which requires a school, when it is oversubscribed, to limit the number of pupils it accepts on the basis of faith to fifty per cent – and replace it with a more effective approach. The existing rule fails according to its own objective: it does little to increase the diversity of Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Hindu schools, because for now at least they are unlikely to appeal to parents of other faiths. But the rule is effectively discriminatory for Roman Catholics: it prevents them from opening new free schools because it is almost certainly against canon law for a Catholic Bishop to set up a school that turned away Catholic pupils on the basis of their Catholicism. Given that there is growing demand for Roman Catholic schools, which are more likely to be ethnically diverse than other schools, more likely to be in poor areas, more likely to be rated Good or Outstanding by Ofsted, and more likely to provide what parents want, the rule should be replaced by a legal duty on faith schools to ensure that their pupils mix – perhaps through sport, performing arts, or school visits – with children of other backgrounds. 3 - Making welfare more contributions-based. In another article Timothy said one problem with the Conservative election defeat of 1906 was that it led to plans for contributions-based welfare backed by his hero Joe Chamberlain being shelved. In 1906, MPs behaved as though their identities as free traders and tariff reformers were more important than as Unionists, and the consequences of their defeat continue to be felt even now. The Lloyd George ‘People’s Budget’ of 1908 introduced a non-contributory pension system – unlike the contributions-based proposal made by Chamberlain that was rejected by Salisbury and Balfour – and our welfare state to this day remains non-contributory (a fact that is, coincidentally, relevant to the debate about EU nationals claiming benefits in Britain). As my colleague Heather Stewart has already reported, May’s new director of policy, John Godfrey, is also interested in social insurance systems that create stronger links between what individuals pay and the welfare they get. 4 - More housebuilding. In another ConservativeHome article Timothy wrote: Often – on aspects of welfare reform, the increase in the minimum wage, and the investment in the Northern Powerhouse and the (excruciatingly badly-branded) Midlands Engine – the Government has got these calls right. But when it comes to energy policy, house building, high immigration, cuts to tax credits, the protection of pensioner benefits, and the profile of spending cuts, it has not. 5 - A full inquiry into Orgreave. The Home Office is still considering calls for a full inquiry into Orgreave, but Timothy said in a ConservativeHome article he was in favour of a proper inquiry. The economy needed to be reformed, the unions needed to be faced down, and unprofitable pits needed to be closed. But if the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know. And here are two ideas that Timothy strongly supports - but which May is much less likely to back because they would involve abandoning Conservative party manifesto promises. 6 - Getting rid of the “triple lock” that ensure state pensions rise every year in line with growth or inflation or by 2.5%, whichever is higher. 7 - Abandoning plans to lift the inheritance tax threshold to £1m. In one ConservativeHome article Timothy wrote: [The chancellor] could redistribute the welfare cuts to take the pressure off low-paid, working people. But the obvious alternative is already off the table: pensioner benefits are protected and so is the “triple lock”, which means that the state pension goes up by the highest out of the growth of wages, inflation or 2.5 per cent. Another option – to demonstrate that the Government really does value hard work above all else – is to stop the inheritance tax cut for estates valued between £650,000 and £1 million. But that policy is not only a manifesto promise but a totem for the Conservative party. Sam Freedman, who used to be a policy adviser to Michael Gove when Gove was education secretary and he is now executive director at Teach First, the organisation that gets high-powered graduates into teaching, has put out a statement strongly criticising the plans to extend grammar schools. He said: The prime minister has said that she wants to create a country that works for all, but education experts are united that the evidence shows grammar schools harm social mobility. Every child deserves the best education and our country needs all young people supported to succeed. Our focus should be on raising standards across the board to end the scandal of disadvantage determining destiny. UPDATE: I’ve corrected the post above. Freedman was a civil service policy adviser to Gove, not a special adviser as originally stated. Justine Greening, the education secretary, has told MPs that the government believes that selective grammar schools can play a role in the education system but does not want to see a “return to the past” of mass 11-plus tests. Donald Tusk, president of the European council, has said Britain should begin formal negotiations on leaving the European Union as soon as possible. The Houses of Parliament are at risk of a catastrophic crisis that could destroy them unless MPs and peers are evacuated for six years to allow £4bn of restoration works, a report said. You can read the report here. Big companies should be forced to publish their tax returns as part of efforts to clamp down on avoidance and evasion, an independent review commissioned by Labour has recommended. As the Press Association reports, the first stage of the review of HM Revenue and Customs said related documents and calculations should also be publicly available. Parliamentary committees should be empowered to examine sensitive tax information, with MPs and peers deciding whether scrutiny of documents and practices should be conducted behind closed doors, it said. The review by Professor Prem Sikka of the University of Essex also called for the creation of a supervisory board for HMRC to “act as a bulwark against corporate capture and inertia”, accountable to parliamentary committees. That board should also protect tax whistleblowers, the report said. The NHS is missing so many of its key performance targets that it has entered “the perpetual winter of Narnia”, a medical leader has said, after figures revealed the highest ever number of patients on waiting lists. The number of UK workers on zero-hours contracts has leapt 20% in a year to more than 900,000, indicating that insecure employment is becoming a bigger feature of the jobs market. The UK’s new flood defence plans anticipate significantly higher extreme rainfall, after new research was published as part of the government’s National Flood Resilience review. In the comments getoutofmydreams asks how many MPs went to grammar school and private school. I can’t find grammar school figures quickly, but here are the figures for private/state schools, by party. They are from this House of Commons library note (pdf). UPDATE: Thanks to bastu BTL. S/he has posted a link to this Sutton Trust report which says 19% of MPs in the 2015 intake went to grammar school. Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister who oversaw government policy when David Cameron was prime minister and who is now a backbencher, sounded rather non-committal on the World at One just now when asked about grammar schools. Cameron was opposed to opening brand new grammar schools. Letwin said that he personally was “perfectly content” to see the government explore the idea of expanding them, but he also said he was “completely agnostic” about whether one type of school was necessarily better than another. Ministers are often hauled to the Commons to answer an urgent question (UQ) when the government has floated a policy idea in the media but has not yet made a formal announcement. That is exactly what happened today, when Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, was granted a UQ on the back of the Telegraph splash. Normally the minister just turns up and tells MPs to wait until the formal policy paper is published, and in many respects that’s what Justine Greening, the education secretary, was doing today, but these sessions can be nevertheless be quite illuminating and today’s certainly was. Here are five things we learnt. 1 - Theresa May’s plan to “bring back grammar schools” is popular with Conservative MPs - but only up to a point. Most of the Tory MPs who spoke expressed support for grammar schools. But the very first backbencher to be called, and arguably the most important on this issue, Neil Carmichael, the Conservative who chairs the Commons education committee, expressed strong reservations. Telling Greening that the UK was well down the table in international literacy and numeracy league tables, he went on: It is absolutely necessary for any discussion about grammar schools to not distract us from that fundamental task that we have of improving social mobility and making sure that we have the best use of all of the talent across the whole country and not just talk about the few. Sir Desmond Swayne, a former PPS to David Cameron and certainly no Tory leftie, told Greening that he would not fancy having to face parents in his constituency who could not get their children into a local grammar school. (See 11.14am.) And Lucy Allan, another Conservative, demanded an assurance that there would be no return to the days of the 11-plus. (See 11.07am.) 2 - Greening herself seems to sceptical about championing a grammar school renaissance. Some Labour MPs said they thought Greening sounded distinctly lukewarm about the policy she was supposed to be defending and they were right. Greening kept stressing the importance of having an open mind on the matter of educational reform and she said nothing to suggest that she is a grammar school enthusiast (while, quite cleverly, also avoiding sounding disloyal to May.) In fact, Greening even seemed reluctant to use the term “grammar school”, instead preferring to talk about selection. 3 - A full return to a grammar school system seems to be off the table - although the government is considering letting more grammar schools open and extending the principle of selection in state education. Greening was not specific about much, but she did make it very clear that the government was not planning a full return to the grammar/secondary modern era. She said: There will be no return to the simplistic, binary choice of the past where schools separate children into winners and losers, successes or failures. This government wants to focus on the future, to build on our success since 2010 and to create a truly 21st century schools system. And when asked if she would return to the days of the 11-plus, she replied: I can assure you that there will be no return to the past. This is about moving forward. This is about having a 21st century approach to our school system, precisely not one that is rooted in the 1960s and 1970s. But Greening did say: “We do think selection can play a role.” It could be that May is keen to talk about grammar schools is because the phrase is popular with the public. (See 10.08am.) But whether the government’s proposals really do involve a large number of new grammar schools, in the traditional meaning of the word, remains to be seen. 4 - Labour is remarkably united in strongly opposing grammar schools. By my count only one Labour MP expressed some support for the government’s idea (Kate Hoey) and otherwise it was striking how MPs from all wings of the party spoke out very strongly against the idea. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, was particularly effective. She told Greening: Can you tell the House what evidence you have to support your belief that grammar schools will help disadvantaged children and close the attainment gap? At a time when our schools are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, with the thousands taught in super-sized classes and schools facing real-term cuts to their budget for the first time in nearly two decades, pushing ahead with grammar schools shows a dangerous misunderstanding of the real issues facing our schools. This makes it all the more surprising that Jeremy Corbyn chose not to raise the grammar school issue at PMQs yesterday. Perhaps he chose to avoid the subject because his son attended one, and his head of strategy and communications Seumas Milne sent his children to grammar schools. Given that Corbyn’s second marriage broke up because he did not want his son to go to a grammar school, he could argue that his opposition to grammar schools is so strong and sincere that it has led to great sacrifice. But it is understandable why someone very reluctant to discuss his family in public may have decided it was a subject best avoided at PMQs. 5 - The Tories will try to turn this into an issue of what works versus ideology. Greening did not really engage with the arguments raised about grammar schools and social mobility. Instead, she just argued that it was sensible to have a debate, and she accused Labour of being dogmatic. It would be wrong to discount how we can improve prospects for those children, especially the most disadvantaged, purely because of political dogma. If Labour is not willing to ask itself these difficult questions, how can it possibly come up with any of the solutions? Here is my colleague Heather Stewart on Justine Greening’s UQ. And this is from Freddie Whittaker, political reporter for Schools Week. The grammar schools UQ is now over. I will post a summary shortly. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, asks if Greening backs the Tory manifesto commitment to allow all good schools to expland. Greening says she does support that. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says there were no new announcements of policy at the Conservative backbench 1922 committee last night. He would be the first to object if there had been, he says. Greening says, when the new policy is announced, she will make a statement to the Commons. Labour’s Clive Efford says investment in early years education does more for social mobility than anything done at 11. Does the government regret closing 800 Sure Start centres. Greening says it is not a matter of either/or. The government can focus on both. Labour’s Chris Matheson says you cannot have selection and parental choice. So has the government abandoned parental choice? Greening says Matheson should wait until the proposals are actually published. David Nuttall, a Conservative, says grammar schools will not survive if parents do not choose them. But poorer parents should have the same choices as richer ones. Greening agrees. It would be wrong to take something off the table because of “political ideology”. Labour’s Tom Blenkinsop asks how bringing back grammar schools will help the government’s industrial strategy. Greening says education is critical to the government’s industrial strategy. Labour’s Kate Green says that her constituency has grammar schools, but that parents of children with special needs feel their children are excluded from them. Greening says this is an incredibly important point. Kevin Foster, a Conservative, says there is nothing radical about extending grammar schools. Greening says she wants a practical debate not an ideological debate. But Ukip’s Douglas Carswell has tweeting in favour of grammar schools. Here is Labour’s Yvette Cooper on Greening’s statement. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw says he has not heard Greening explicitly back Theresa May’s policy. Is Greening aware of any evidence that shows grammar schools improve attainment across the board or social mobility? Greening says the government’s plans have not been published. She quotes Sutton Trust report saying selective schools did not damage other schools around them. Chris Philp, a Conservative, says he went to a London grammar and owes his place in the Commons to that. He asks Greening to back a new grammar in his constituency. Greening say she wants to give good schools more freedom to expand. Labour’s Nic Dakin says Margaret Thatcher said 11 was too early to make decisions that determine a child’s entire future. Greening says Dakin should wait for the policy options being published by the government. Gareth Johnson, a Conservative, says schools can select on ability in performing art, art or music but not maths. How can that be right? Greening says Johnson is right. John Pugh, the Lib Dem, says the biggest problem in education is under-performing boys. How will grammar schools help? Greening says her department has more than one policy for tackling under-achievement. She says the Sutton Trust has done some good research on what can be done to improve boy’s academic performance. Labour’s Vernon Coaker says bringing back grammar schools means bringing back secondary moderns. How can that be right? Greening says she does not accept that. Some secondary moderns did not enter any pupils for exams. The education system has changed enormously, she says. She says this is about a modern approach to education. Greening says government’s plan will not involve bringing back secondary moderns. Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, says grammar schools will not suit every area. He says he would not welcome telling parents in some towns in his constituency that, if their children do not get into the grammar school, they will have to be bused elsewhere. Greening says local communities will have to be involved in these discussions. Labour’s Pat McFadden says where there is failure and disadvantaged, the answer should not be “this festival of bring-backery”. Instead the government should focus excellence in all schools. Greening urges McFadden to wait until the government’s plans are published. But Labour are opposing all change, she says. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, says he attended a grammar school with a mostly working-class intake. Why is it acceptable to nurture sporting excellence but not academic excellence? Greening says parents should be able to find not just a good school, but a good school for their child. Labour’s Kevin Brennan asks Greening if Sir Michael Wilshaw was being ideological when he said the idea that grammar schools boost social mobility is “tosh”. Greening says people will have different views. But we should have a debate, she says. She says it is important to do more to raise attainment. Lucy Allan, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that there will be no return to the 11-plus. Greening says there will be “no return to the past”. The government wants a system suited to the 21st century. Greening rules out return to the old 11-plus system. The Labour MP Kate Hoey says that she went to a grammar school and that the government is right not to rule out extending grammar schools. She says Greening should visit Northern Ireland, where grammar schools are extremely popular. Greening thanks Hoey. She may visit Northern Ireland, she says. She accepts that this is a very emotive debate. But she is keen to look at all the options. The government will be setting out its plans shortly. The Labour MP Chris Bryant also thinks Justine Greening does not sound very enthusiastic about bringing back grammar schools. The Labour MP Hilary Benn says the best thing we can do for young people is to encourage them. He says grammar schools are divisive. Why does Greening think it would be good to go back to a situation where children are told they have failed at 11. Greening says the last Labour government left a legacy of grade inflation and other problems with education. The Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who used to chair the education committee, says Greening should listen to the evidence, which shows that grammar schools do not help disadvantaged pupils. Look at Kent, he says. Greening says Kent is trying to get more disadvantaged pupils into grammar schools. But Sheerman objects to grammar schools on principles, she says. She says it is better to focus on the practicalities. This is from Lucy Powell, the Labour MP and former shadow education secretary. Greening says Rayner seems to be criticising the status quo, while wanting to keep it. She says Rayner reminds her of the voices she heard on education when she was growing up. To complain about the school system, but then to object to a debate about reforming it, is illogical, she says. She says Labour is being ideological. She says the government is interested in practical solutions. It would be wrong to avoid considering selection because of dogma. We do believe selection can play a role. The government will set out its plans, she says. MPs can then debate them. Greening says “selection can play a role” and criticises Labour for rejecting it on the grounds of “dogma”. Angela Rayner says the cat is out of the bag; we now know the government’s policy. She says the evidence shows that grammar schools do not help disadvantaged pupils. This policy will not help social mobility but will entrench inequality and social disadvantage. She says Theresa May promised to lead a one nation government, she promised to follow the evidence, and she promised to govern in the interests of the many, not the few. But this policy fails on every measure. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, asks for an urgent question on grammar schools. Justine Greening, the education secretary, says education is at the heart of the government’s plans to create a system that works for everyone. But Labour left the education system in a poor state, she says. Since then, standards have risen, she says. She says she is “open-minded” on selection in schools. But there will be no return to the “binary choice” of the past, where pupils are divided into winners or losers. The government is looking at a range of options, she says. Greening says government looking at “a range of options” and that she is “open-minded” about selection. She says there will be no return to the “binary choice” of the past, where pupils are divided into winners or losers. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has also condemned Theresa May’s reported views on grammar schools. In a statement he said: Theresa May’s argument for grammar schools is so flawed that it does not stand up to the most basic scrutiny. A postcode lottery is not fixed by creating a different discriminator I assumed that grammar schools were the obsession of a few on the right of the Tory who party who seem to want to stop the world as they want to get off, but it seems this thinking has seeped into Number 10. You can see clearly that without the Liberal Democrats to restrain the Tories they are showing their true colours: divisive and uncaring. We need to make every school excellent, support every child and make sure every young person has the aspiration to succeed. If Theresa May suddenly cares about inclusive education she should extend Liberal Democrat achievements in the coalition such as free early years education, the pupil premium and free school dinners. In the Commons Liam Fox has just said he will have an open, international competition to find a new official to head the new international trade department. Fox says he would consider hiring foreigner to head international trade department. In the House of Lords yesterday Lord Nash, an education minister, answered a private notice question (the Lords equivalent of an urgent question) on grammar schools. He did not give many details away about the government’s policy, but he made two interesting points. Nash claimed there was “no clear evidence” to support the anti-grammar school views of Sir Michael Wilshaw, the outgoing Ofsted chief. I am a great fan of Sir Michael Wilshaw and he has done an excellent job as chief inspector. He is right to pinpoint the great transformation in London schools, started under a Labour government through their London Challenge and academies programme, which we have sought to continue. In fact there is no clear evidence to support his views but, as I have said, we are keeping an open mind. We are aware of the strength of grammar schools and would like more free school meals pupils going to them. He said the government was trying to make the 11-plus tests “less susceptible to coaching”. As always, the noble baroness makes a very good point, relating to coaching for tests. We are working with the Grammar School Heads Association to see whether we can develop tests that are much less susceptible to coaching. Some 66 grammar schools now prioritise free school meals applications. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, has put out a statement about Theresa May’s reported comments about grammar schools. (See 9.10am.) She says that, if May is talking about introducing “an element of selection” in state schools, she does not understand how the system works. Keates said: There is already more than an ‘element’ of selection in the system. Selection is deeply rooted and the warnings on the adverse impact on social mobility are too late. The education policies of the previous coalition government, continued by this one, premised on extensive and excessive autonomy for schools and the obsessive pursuit of deregulation, have rapidly increased covert selection, often targeted at pupils from materially deprived backgrounds. Sending out strong advance signals to prospective families that if their child obtains a place at the school they will be expected to make significant financial contributions to school funds, requirements to purchase uniforms from expensive sole suppliers and charging for educational activities are all strategies of covert selection. It is now a reality that access to education for some children and young people is based on their parents’ ability to pay. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is taking questions in the Commons for the first time now. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem MP, has just asked about the trade negotiators Fox’s department will be forming. Brake said that he had been speaking to a headhunter recently - prompting laughter from MPs who thought he might be contemplating an alternative career. That was not what he meant, Brake said. Fox did not give details of how many trade negotiators he would be hiring, but he said he did not want to create a big army of bureaucrats. The Polling Digest website has published a helpful analysis of what the public think about grammar schools, based on two recent polls. It is worth reading in full, but here is the conclusion. The basic conclusion from the recent polling data is that grammar schools generally receive more support in the polls than proposals to stop building grammar schools or close them down. However, it is certainly interesting to note that public opinion is quite nuanced; when people were confronted with two counterarguments to grammar schools, support was in some cases strong. What does this mean for the overall stance of public opinion? It could mean two things: first, it could suggest that public opinion is malleable and that if parties opposed to new grammar schools exploit that malleability, the voters may be turned away from grammar schools. Alternatively, though, it could suggest that while voters are clearly aware of the counterarguments to grammar schools – and have some degree of affinity with them – this is already baked in to the polling numbers; in other words, that voters know the problems with grammar schools but feel overall that grammar schools should still be opened. Polling Digest also says that people “overwhelmingly agree that grammar schools help academic success and increase social mobility”. This is interesting because it is the exact opposite of what people who are experts in social mobility have been saying, like David Willetts here, or Alan Miliburn here. (Put more bluntly, the public are wrong.) My colleague Sally Weale has written a very good article about what it is like for parents in Kent where children are sitting the 11-plus to see if they can get into grammar school. There is an urgent question on grammar schools in the Commons at 10.30am. The speaker takes a dim view of ministers announcing policy on the front page of the Telegraph and not in the House of Commons chamber. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, is meeting Theresa May in Number 10 this morning. Tusk is saying Britain should start its Brexit negotiations with the EU “asap”. He seems to be referring to triggering article 50, the formal process that starts the two-year withdrawal process. But May has already said she will not do that until early in the next year. It is not clear whether or not Tusk is suggesting that that timetable needs to be accelerated. Theresa May addressed the Conservative backbench 1922 committee last night and she used the session to explain her plans to bring back grammar schools. According to today’s Telegraph splash, she told her MPs that she wanted a new generation of “inclusive” grammar schools. According to sources at the meeting, she answered critics by saying: “We have already got selection haven’t we – it’s called ‘selection by house price’” .... She will publish a green paper and give a major speech after telling MPs last night that she wants a new generation of grammar schools to be “inclusive and not exclusive”. Mrs May said she wanted an education system that “catered for the different needs of all children” and indicated that grammar schools have a role to play. She suggested that some of the government’s 500 new free schools, announced by David Cameron shortly before he stepped down, could be grammars. “She said she didn’t want a situation where parents wanted a selective school only to be told they couldn’t have one,” a source at the meeting said. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has been defending the government’s plans this morning. But Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and former Lib Dem leader, and Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, have both used interviews this morning to criticise the plans. Clegg said: I know they talked about grammar schools in their manifesto. They didn’t talk about extending selection to free schools and so on, which seems to be now what they intend to do. This is the danger of having a new government with new leadership and new priorities, not elected by the people, now foisting their own evidence-free prejudices upon us. There’s no evidence at all that that is the answer to many of the problems in our education system. And Balls said: To tell a kid at 10 or 11, you’re second best, they then have to arrive at that school and the teachers have a huge task to persuade them, you can still do well, you’ve still got talent, you’ve still got ability. You shouldn’t do that to kids at 10 or 11. My colleague Jessica Elgot has a full update here. I will post more on this as the debate moves on. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: NHS England publishes the latest hospital waiting figures. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on zero-hours contracts. 10am: Liam Fox, the new international trade secretary, takes questions for the first time in the Commons. 11.15am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, publishes plans to reform HM Revenue &amp; Customs. 3.30pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. Later, at 9pm, Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith will be taking part in a BBC Question Time hustings. I will be covering that on a separate blog.

In response to a freedom of information request, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), an arm of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), said errors by senior fire officers in a preparedness exercise at Sellafield \"could have led to delays in responding to the nuclear emergency and a prolonged release of radioactive material off-site\". The criticism is revealed at a critical time for the nuclear industry, which is trying to build public confidence after the crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plant while drawing up plans to construct a new generation of atomic power stations in Britain. It is also an embarrassment to Nuclear Management Partners, the private sector consortium which runs Sellafield and is part-owned by Areva, the French engineering company that has prepared the design for a proposed reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The initial report from the ONR led to an improvement notice being issued to the Cumbrian site, ordering it to improve its training and wider preparedness to deal with emergencies. Two HSE fire specialists had watched a safety exercise in December 2011 which tested the Sellafield fire and rescue service's ability to search for two people after a fictional accident that led to the spillage of radioactive liquid and an aerial release of radioactivity. Although the exercise presented \"simple scenarios under ideal conditions\", the service's \"resources were stretched\" and \"there were insufficient numbers of firefighters to achieve the objectives\", according to the HSE report. A spokesman for Sellafield said the successful introduction of an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) had subsequently led to the improvement notice issued in February 2012 being \"closed out\" by the ONR. \"This IRMP is the first of its kind for Sellafield Ltd and ONR has asked Sellafield Ltd if it would be happy to share it as good practice with other operators. A number of key improvements are being progressed to achieve the implementation of the IRMP, including enhanced training for SF&amp;RS [Sellafield fire and rescues service] firefighters and officers,\" he added. The inspectors found evidence of \"significant deficiencies around availability of resources, frequency and quality of training, competency and operational preparedness\". The report, obtained by the website NuclearSpin, also said that Sellafield had already \"identified the need to improve arrangements in this area [but] no effective remedial action was put in place\". The service is a critical part of Sellafield's management of nuclear safety and the HSE found it in breach of its licence conditions and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. This is not the first time the plant has been criticised by the HSE. A report in 2010 disclosed a number of safety problems at the site and the HSE ordered the closure for safety reasons of a plant for solidifying highly radioactive liquid waste. The executive also refused to endorse a \"lifetime plan\" outlining schedules for decommissioning the site over the next 110 years. Sellafield was also recently under fire from the House of Commons public accounts committee over soaring project costs, large salaries and continuing risks. One committee member, the Great Grimsby MP Austin Mitchell, described Sellafield as \"the biggest nuclear slum in Europe\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/nov/04/british-government-leading-gunpowder-plot-democracy-eu-us-trade","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-04T20:16:41Z","webTitle":"The British government is leading a gunpowder plot against democracy | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/04/british-government-leading-gunpowder-plot-democracy-eu-us-trade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/04/british-government-leading-gunpowder-plot-democracy-eu-us-trade","fields":{"headline":"The British government is leading a gunpowder plot against democracy","bodyText":"On this day a year ago, I was in despair. A dark cloud was rising over the Atlantic, threatening to blot out some of the freedoms our ancestors lost their lives to secure. The ability of parliaments on both sides of the ocean to legislate on behalf of their people was at risk from an astonishing treaty that would grant corporations special powers to sue governments. I could not see a way of stopping it. Almost no one had heard of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the US, except those who were quietly negotiating it. And I suspected that almost no one ever would. Even the name seemed perfectly designed to repel public interest. I wrote about it for one reason: to be able to tell my children that I had not done nothing. To my amazement, the article went viral. As a result of the public reaction and the involvement of remarkable campaigners, the European commission and the British government responded. The Stop TTIP petition now carries more than 750,000 signatures; the 38 Degrees petition has 910,000. Last month there were 450 protest actions across 24 member states. The commission was forced to hold a public consultation about the most controversial aspect, and 150,000 people responded. Never let it be said that people cannot engage with complex issues. Nothing has yet been won. Corporations and governments – led by the UK – are mobilising to thwart this uprising. But their position slips a little every month. When the British minister responsible at the time, Ken Clarke, responded to my first articles, he insisted that “nothing could be more foolish” than making the European negotiating position public, as I’d proposed. But last month the commission was obliged to do just this. It’s beginning to look as if the fight against TTIP could become a historic victory for people against corporate power. The central problem is what the negotiators call investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). The treaty would allow corporations to sue governments before an arbitration panel composed of corporate lawyers, at which other people have no representation, and which is not subject to judicial review. Already, thanks to the insertion of ISDS into much smaller trade treaties, big business is engaged in an orgy of litigation, whose purpose is to strike down any law that might impinge on its anticipated future profits. The tobacco firm Philip Morris is suing governments in Uruguay and Australia for trying to discourage people from smoking. The oil firm Occidental was awarded $2.3bn in compensation from Ecuador, which terminated the company’s drilling concession in the Amazon after finding that Occidental had broken Ecuadorean law. The Swedish company Vattenfall is suing the German government for shutting down nuclear power. An Australian firm is suing El Salvador’s government for $300m for refusing permission for a goldmine over concerns it would poison the drinking water. The same mechanism, under TTIP, could be used to prevent UK governments from reversing the privatisation of the railways and the NHS, or from defending public health and the natural world against corporate greed. The corporate lawyers who sit on these panels are beholden only to the companies whose cases they adjudicate, who at other times are their employers. As one of these people commented: “When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign states have agreed to investment arbitration at all … Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.” So outrageous is this arrangement that even the Economist, usually the champion of corporate power and trade treaties, has now come out against it. It calls investor-state dispute settlement “a way to let multinational companies get rich at the expense of ordinary people”. When David Cameron and the corporate press launched their campaign against the candidacy of Jean-Claude Juncker for president of the European commission, they claimed that he threatened British sovereignty. It was a perfect inversion of reality. Juncker, seeing the way the public debate was going, promised in his manifesto that “I will not sacrifice Europe’s safety, health, social and data protection standards … on the altar of free trade … Nor will I accept that the jurisdiction of courts in the EU member states is limited by special regimes for investor disputes.” Juncker’s crime was that he had pledged not to give away as much of our sovereignty to corporate lawyers as Cameron and the media barons demanded. Juncker is now coming under extreme pressure. Last month 14 states wrote to him, privately and without consulting their parliaments, demanding the inclusion of ISDS (the letter was leaked a few days ago). And who is leading this campaign? The British government. It’s hard to get your head around the duplicity involved. While claiming to be so exercised about our sovereignty that it is prepared to leave the EU, our government is secretly insisting that the European commission slaughter our sovereignty on behalf of corporate profits. Cameron is leading a gunpowder plot against democracy. He and his ministers have failed to answer the howlingly obvious question: what’s wrong with the courts? If corporations want to sue governments, they already have a right to do so, through the courts, like anyone else. It’s not as if, with their vast budgets, they are disadvantaged in this arena. Why should they be allowed to use a separate legal system, to which the rest of us have no access? What happened to the principle of equality before the law? If our courts are fit to deprive citizens of their liberty, why are they unfit to deprive corporations of anticipated future profits? Let’s not hear another word from the defenders of TTIP until they have answered this question. It cannot be ducked for much longer. Unlike previous treaties, this one is being dragged by campaigners into the open, where its justifications shrivel on exposure to the light. There’s a tough struggle to come, and the outcome is by no means certain, but my sense is that we will win."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/dec/05/waste-management-problems-sellafield","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-05T21:00:04Z","webTitle":"Mixed reactions to waste management problems at Sellafield | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/05/waste-management-problems-sellafield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/dec/05/waste-management-problems-sellafield","fields":{"headline":"Mixed reactions to waste management problems at Sellafield","bodyText":"GMB has been hugely critical of the way the Sellafield contract has been managed by Nuclear Management Partners (Report, 5 December). The people at the sharp end of this mismanagement are the 10,000 ordinary working men and women on the site. Our members employed there work in some of the most hazardous known environments, dealing with what is, in large part, a cold war legacy. Seemingly against the odds, NMP was recently awarded a contract extension. Did ministers ignore the recommendations of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority? Was it for ideological reasons, because the only viable alternative to a contract extension was to bring the work back in-house? We must not lose sight of the fact that there is a huge stockpile of plutonium on the site. As a society we will have hard choices. The only sensible thing to do is to use it for something socially useful – producing electricity. Gary Smith GMB nNational secretary, GMB commercial services section • You outline the extensive costs as a consequence of failure to produce a comprehensive cradle-to-grave plan when the original nuclear plants and the Sellafield site were built. As the UK begins a new generation of reactors, spent fuel and radioactive waste management must remain a priority. The UK's stockpile of plutonium was planned to be reused as fuel in fast reactors, but we ended our fast-reactor research programme in the late 1990s and instead opted for indefinite storage of the stockpile. However, security and cost make this an unacceptable long-term option. Other technically mature options, such as reusing the plutonium as new mixed oxide (mox) fuel in reactors, must be explored. Planning for the long-term, the government must keep open the full range of options for using the stockpile and managing future waste by reconsidering its participation in international fast-reactor research programmes. Professor Roger Cashmore Chair, Royal Society report Fuel Cycle Stewardship in a Nuclear Renaissance • Your article says that I \"leaked\" the KPMG report on Sellafield mismanagement to the Commons' public accounts committee. I did not leak the report, as I had legitimately obtained it via a freedom of information request from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority three days before the first hearing of the PAC on Sellafield mismanagement last month. When I learned of the hearing, on the morning it was due to take place, I decided that the parliamentary committee charged with overseeing the value-for-money of the expenditure of our taxes by public bodies should be aware of this report before it held its hearing with NDA and Department of Energy and Climate Change witnesses, so I emailed it to the chair, Margaret Hodge MP, and the clerk to the PAC. The distinction is a very important one. Dr David Lowry Stoneleigh, Surrey • I'm pleased that, after parliament's inadequate scrutiny of the exorbitantly expensive Hinkley Point nuclear reactor project, we are going to see proper consideration of UK nuclear new build by the European commission (Report, 2 December). Our organisation has joined with parliamentarians and other groups to sign a letter to the EU opposing the deal. It notes that \"in terms of competition within the EU, state aid for nuclear power in the UK is entirely at odds with the coming single market for electricity in the EU and with the principle that there should be free movement of goods and services throughout the region. It is bad for the development, throughout Europe, of effective alternatives – renewables and energy conservation – which are ready to go, cheaper than nuclear power, and very much quicker to build.\" . That is why Germany, Austria and other EU states oppose nuclear power and why the deal should be rejected by the European commission. Rather than cutting more than 10,000 jobs from the energy efficiency sector, we should be investing further in sustainable energy.

People are eating sandwiches, popping in for a chat or to read the paper. So far, so normal. But the view from the window tells a different story. The cafe overlooks a square full of boarded-up shops and homes. Graffiti covers almost every available surface, including a forlorn children's playground. In the neighbouring streets, row upon row of vacant and abandoned houses are covered in eye-poppingly colourful doodles or large murals by street artists. To add to the dystopian feel of the place, every so often a large pile of rubble shows the spot where a house once stood, and the giant smoke-billowing cooling towers of Belgium's first commercial nuclear-power station loom on one side. This is Doel, a 400-year-old village north-west of Antwerp that has been at the heart of a political battle for survival for over two decades. A state-funded corporation is seeking to raze it to make way for the land-hungry port of Antwerp. But members of the ever-dwindling local populace are fighting to keep their homes and the village alive. They say a second container dock isn't necessary since the previous one, which opened in 2005, is being used to less than a fifth of its capacity (the corporation disputes this figure). What's more, they argue, the riverside village has lush nature, culture and heritage in abundance – plus the first stone-mill in Belgium and a listed early 17th-century house that belonged to Peter Paul Rubens's family. From a population of around 1,300 in the early 70s, there are now only 25 inhabitants left. But they are a brave and well-organised bunch. A 52-year-old named Marina Apers is their unlikely champion. She lives in a house emblazoned with banners announcing that she and her husband will \"leave Doel over our dead bodies\". \"Every time the government succeed in something, we start legal procedures against them – and mostly, we win,\" she says. So far, the EU's strict environmental laws have been on the villagers' side: Doel is, among other things, home to one of Europe's largest swallow colonies. Apers moved here in 1991 after being employed as a cleaner at the nuclear power station. She and her husband, Guido, were assured that buying there was a safe bet, but after they renovated their home, rumours started to surface that Doel \"was going to have to disappear\". The decline hasn't happened overnight, though the majority of inhabitants left just before 2000 when they were offered cash premiums to sell up voluntarily. \"They threatened that if people didn't do that they would be expropriated,\" she says, \"and if you are expropriated, you get very little money.\" By 2007 there were 350 people left and squatters had started to move in, making some of the deserted houses habitable again. That year, Apers helped set up the campaigning group Doel 2020. One of the ways it planned to ensure the long-term survival of Doel was to turn it into a haven for artists. \"In the beginning it was good. The idea was that it would become an open-air museum,\" she says. World-renowned artists such as Luc Tuymans and Michelangelo Pistoletto took part. Soon the village attracted street artists from across Belgium and abroad who left their mark. \"In the early days the murals related to the message the residents had, which was 'don't take our village away',\" says the Brussels-based photojournalist Virginia Mayo, who has been visiting Doel since 1998. \"But later, other artists came and just used all the buildings as wall canvases for their work, probably because there was little police presence.\" Of all the street art adorning Doel's abandoned walls, it is the internationally famous Belgian muralist ROA's haunting oversized rat, crow, headless boar and upside-down rabbit that have become the village's most memorable. But other well-known street artists from Belgium, Holland and France have also left a trail of weird and wonderful cartoon-like figures – a moody mural of Barack Obama as the Joker by Amsterdam's Ives.One and some robot aliens by the Brussels-based artist Resto are notable examples. It's a surreal place, strewn with hundreds of abandoned buildings, including schools, petrol stations and a now-silent town hall, and the constant hum of high-voltage power lines intensifies the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Some houses still have furniture and toys lying around in rooms and gardens. As Mayo writes in her book of photos of the village: \"Doel feels like Chernobyl without the accident.\" Against its will the place has become a tourist attraction, with thousands of urban-decay enthusiasts, photographers and tourists visiting every year. Some don't even get out of their cars, choosing instead to drive down the empty streets, windows open, camera phones aloft. The waitress at the cafe says her customers are chiefly employees from the nuclear plant and the hordes of tourists. \"People come here because it's so bizarre,\" she says. A few buildings have remained free of graffiti, including the 11 homes still in private hands, the church, the cemetery and the house once belonging to Rubens's family, which the corporation has promised will be dismantled and rebuilt brick by brick in a neighbouring town. Signs stating that Doel is inhabited are intended to encourage good behaviour, but as Mayo says, \"respect for the town has diminished and for some it has became just derelict rather than a curiosity\". Vandalism and looting is commonplace, agrees Apers, as are illegal raves in the village's dilapidated barns, despite stepped-up police patrols and neighbourhood watch schemes. \"Last night I got to sleep at 2am because I could hear people racing down the streets in their cars,\" she says. Another of Doel's remaining inhabitants, the larger-than-life 80-year-old Emilienne Driesen, has lived in the village all her life and is now the only resident on her road. She keeps her home in excellent condition yet, poignantly, has had to put a sign in her window reminding passersby that dit huis is bewoond (\"this house is inhabited\"). At night she takes sleeping and anti-anxiety pills to block out the noise of vandals, but is adamant she will never leave. The Doel 2020 activists and remaining inhabitants are acutely aware that this widespread destruction and deterioration only strengthens the port's case. \"They have done it on purpose,\" says Apers, who refers to it as 'demolition politics'. \"There are over 400 families who would like to come and live here because they work nearby.\" But the corporation argues that Doel is unsafe and uninhabitable. How much longer Apers and her fellow campaigners can hold out is unclear, but their fighting spirit remains. Whether the town survives or not, it is unlikely the murals will. They stand as transient artefacts in a town whose fate is utterly in limbo. • Travel was provided by Visit Flanders. • This article was amended on 9 June. It originally stated that the village of Doel was 700 years old. Though the area was inhabited beforehand it was not a proper village until the 17th century. This has been changed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"artanddesign/2015/may/10/stephen-walter-artist-map-maker-london-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-09T23:05:07Z","webTitle":"Artist Stephen Walter: ‘My maps are all about human residues and traces’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/10/stephen-walter-artist-map-maker-london-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2015/may/10/stephen-walter-artist-map-maker-london-interview","fields":{"headline":"Artist Stephen Walter: ‘My maps are all about human residues and traces’","bodyText":"I meet Stephen Walter outside the Aquatics Centre at the Olympic Park in east London, in order to walk back to his studio near Fish Island on the River Lea just beyond the perimeter fence.

The Island, about to be published in book form, is part oral history, part folklore, part personal homage, and was completed in 2008, when this park was still being cleared. Walter denoted the site as a set of Olympic rings between the football pitches of “hack ’em down” marshes and an ironic “end of the world” line that marks the border with Newham (“worst life expectancy – female”) and competing associations of “McGrath Waste Management: a terrace of clank and dust, hear the noise and feel it in your eyes”, “paint, glue and parafin[sic]” works, “African mirical [sic] believers” and “new city pads?”. If he were to redraw his Island now – and he has plans to do maybe two or three more versions in his lifetime – then it would include one or two different magnifying-glass impressions of the place he has experienced since then, which he annotates in conversation as we walk. For a start, a revamped map might record that those “paint glue and parafin” factories had been compulsorily purchased. And that in their place had come the stadiums and the Olympic Village, sold off as the “city pads” he prophesied, the Westfield shopping centre, landed from Oz, what he calls by turns a “modernist utopia seen through a corporate prism”, “a consumption theme park for somnambulists”, “a monolith of organised fun”, and a “futurist battleground for West Ham and Millwall fans”. Walter’s studio has been on the margin of this site throughout the transformation. He remembers when the blue fence went up around the Olympic Park and construction began. He is an inveterate urban adventurer – for his subsequent subterranean version of his Island map Walter occasionally wandered old sewers with his friend, the celebrated “place hacker” Bradley Garrett, (motto: explore everything), who, he says, treats “the whole urban landscape as if he were a curious child”. In this sense, to Walter, a cheerful trespasser, the blue fence was fighting talk. “I broke in and started walking around the Olympic construction site on a Friday afternoon,” he remembers. “There was no one around except a few bods in yellow jackets. I was just exploring the abandoned factories. Litter-strewn, stripped out, the titty calendars still on walls. I love that idea of ruin – it is food for the curious brain. Anyway, I was wandering around and this security car pulls up and an eastern European skinhead guy got out and pointed a machine gun at me.” The full-on Olympic experience, I suggest. What happened? “I was like ‘Easy – I just got lost.’ Fortunately he had a colleague with him, a London Rasta, who calmed him down and asked me quite politely to leave.” We walk along the wide post-Olympic avenues, with their insistent flags still flapping three years after the event: “Discover. Share. Enjoy.” We are the only people in evidence. “It was odd here before,” Walter says. “Almost like a borderland, quite creative. It was tacky, but things were being made. Quite big factories, and a mix of small business and design studios. I don’t know whether it will ever be properly used now, it will always be becoming something. Still, there is an Apple Store at Westfield, so I can’t really complain.” I suppose you could say that Walter works in the same tradition or space as Iain Sinclair or Peter Ackroyd, London’s psychogeographers, but what he does is both more visual and freer in spirit. His studio, when we get there, exists in that developers’ limbo between warehouse – it was part of the Percy Dalton salted peanut factory – and loft apartment. The rent is due for renegotiation in five years at which time, Walter imagines, the artists and makers will be priced out, having served their hipster purpose, and the buildings will become asset-class residential opportunities. In the meantime, the space is the perfect home for his site-specific one-man industry. The walls are lined with fastidious works in progress in Walter’s two chosen forms – firstly, semi-abstract landscapes and wildernesses, each one intensely finely detailed, full of recurrent hand-drawn natural details, and secondly, maps and plans. He is working on the first draft of a commission from a charity called Flash of Splendour Arts, which works particularly with autistic and refugee children. The commission is to update the maps that accompanied Poly-Olbion, John Drayton’s epic poem of the counties of Britain, published in two parts in 1612 and 1622. Walter’s early outline views Britain – topically – spreading out from Edinburgh; he is using nuclear power stations as his orienting features. On a nearby work table is a comparable project, just completed: a beautiful map of Sir Thomas More’s Utopia, 500 years after it was first conceived, with all the imagined history since inked in. In Walter’s version the passage of time has not been kind to the original communalist paradise. A capitalist revolution has occurred in about 1900 and the resultant island state is now an edgy holiday destination, a “leisure island”: “There is a mass tourist part, here,” he says, talking me through it, “a sunset coast, the Costa Del University of the Third Age. This is where the proletariat still live. There are some Utope separatists. MoD lands, inevitably. A surfing spot. It has all become ghettoised, branded, a land grab, basically…” Walter, 39, grew up in New Barnet. His father was a policeman, his mother an émigré German originally from the Black Forest region. Barnet is the northernmost suburb – or coastal town – of his original London Island. “If you went to the end of my road you could see the woods on the edge of the city,” he says of his childhood home. He has, as a result, he suggests, always subsequently gravitated inwards to the urban centre, or outwards in search of wilderness. As a student his art was quite expansive, gestural; he was drawn to search out little utopias, haunted forests. He had the idea that immersing himself in them might put a bit of “William Blake magic back into a society that has become very formulaic – anyway, that was the idea.” At the end of one day at the Royal College of Art working on screen prints, he watched as the technician who had been helping him collected the excess ink that had been used and poured it into great big containers. Walter asked him what he was doing. When the technician explained that the waste ink was collected in lorries and taken to a toxic waste site, it got him thinking. “I am a consumer of the world’s resources as much as anyone else,” he says now, “I don’t claim any virtue or anything, but on the other hand I do think trees are sacred things. It did hit me that in trying to capture that fact, one of the main things I was actually creating was this toxic waste…” One response to that was for Walter to embark on a drawing that wasted nothing, and “literally took me two years”. It was a multilayered pencil street map, one sheet on top of the other, of places that were important to him. “The only environmental damage in that was to my hand and elbow and my time and my eyes,” he says. That was the beginning of his “slavish” current methods, building up sign and symbol over hours and weeks and months. It is tempting, Walter suggests, as the scope of his work has increased, and prints of his maps have become coveted, to employ assistants to help in some of it. He tries to resist that impulse. “I go into art shows and see these vast works that other people have made for the artist,” he says. “With my subject matter, though, it is all about human residues and traces that have often taken a long time to come about and settle in the geography, so I think you have to do that process justice in your own methods somehow.” Walter, as a child, always loved that leap you have to make from looking at maps to imagining what the landscape they represented was like. He would pore over Tolkien’s Mordor. He starts working on a new map now as he might begin plotting a novel: going through audio archives, reading books, interviewing people – and of course poking around in corners of the city. He has, in the past, done work towards comparable maps of Liverpool and Manchester and Berlin, but it is to London he has returned, partly because it is home, and partly because it understands itself through his kind of accreted historical layering. As well as elevating the handmade, the maps are a melting pot of all those stories, the theatre of them. “Some stories stick to places,” Walter says. “In the etymology of place names you are probably going back thousands of years, way past written history.” Those places still in Walter’s imagination retain traces of their original meaning – the comforts of Homeystead (Hampstead), the pagan origins of rough and ready Seven Sisters. That is why, he suggests, something like the Olympic park seems so alien. “It is a very broad eraser through what was there before.” When Walter’s Island was displayed alongside the early hand-drawn maps of London at the memorable British Library show Magnificent Maps: Power, Propaganda and Art of 2010 it became clear that any map is, as he says, “always a projection of the views and opinions of its maker”. Some of his own projection is quietly comic, the obsessive city dweller’s mind map. But it is, also, an act of reclamation, reminding us that the built space is ours to live within, refusing the A-Z of ownership and statute, and reaffirming the thing that really binds the city: the stories all of its citizens share in their heads. I wonder at one point if Walter has any interest in ley lines and those who would divine in London a new Jerusalem. He laughs. “I don’t buy geomancy,” he says. “I am much more interested in Alfred Watkins, who wrote The Old Straight Track in 1925. The ley lines were the most direct routes for getting from A to B to trade or whatever. That history has enough magic for me. I don’t need dowsers to find that past wonderful.” Stephen Walter’s The Island: London Mapped is published by Prestel at £22.50.

Wednesday's vote, by councils in Cumbria on whether to move forward with plans for deep underground storage of waste in the area, is the perfect illustration. But let's start at the beginning. Is burying nuclear waste deep within bedrock necessary? Yes is the answer of most experts, though only because it is the least worst option. Over 25 countries with significant waste piles have opted for deep disposal as the ultimate solution. The perils of floods, terrorist attacks and earthquakes mean long-term surface storage poses even greater risks than entombing the waste in a rock sarcophagus. As for blasting it into space, as some have suggested, does placing tonnes of radioactive waste on top of hundreds of tonnes of high explosive sound smart? So is deep disposal safe? The answer is no-one knows, because despite 60 years having passed since the nuclear age began, no-one has ever done it. Sweden has the most advanced plans, with an experimental deep disposal facility, but no nuclear waste has yet been consigned to its depths. In the US, vast amounts of money was spent over many years but ended up with plans for deep disposal at Yukka Mountain in Nevada being abandoned in 2010. The situation is uncomfortably similar in the UK. In the 1980s a nationwide search for a suitable burial site was undertaken. In a process described by Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh, as \"mysterious and which no-one understood\", the site selected was conveniently very close to the epicentre of the UK nuclear industry at Sellafield in Cumbria. The government then spent £400m on 22 boreholes investigating the Longlands Farm site but a 65-day public planning enquiry ultimately rejected it because the site was technically unsuitable, as well the proposed project having severe impacts on the surface. They key problem that has to be solved with deep disposal is ensuring, for millennia, that radioactive waste does not leak out into groundwater which is then brought to the surface. The UK is fortunate not to suffer serious earthquakes but the site chosen had extremely complex geology, riven with fractures, meaning there was an unacceptable risk of radioactive waste being washed back to the surface. Extraordinarily, after all that time and money was spent in ruling out that site, it is back in the running under the plans the councils are voting on. Prof Haszeldine is scathing about how this has happened: \"This is a very short-sighted policy, run by driving local councils into volunteering for the wrong reasons: financial inducements. Many of the statements being made by the authorities [about the site] are misleading to wrong.\" In fact the situation now is even worse than in the 1980s. The proposal now would see spent fuel and high-level waste buried, rather than only intermediate level waste. The former is much hotter than the latter, which would hugely accelerate the circulation of groundwater, according to Prof Haszeldine. \"The waste exists and deep geological disposal is by far the best solution,\" said Prof Haszeldine. \"But we should have a genuine national search for technically qualified sites. Ultimately, do we believe in evidence-based policy or political opportunism to exploit communities with limited economic opportunities?\" A number of worrying conclusions can be drawn from all this. First, the process of choosing a deep disposal site appears more concerned with burying political problems than finding the right geological site. Asking local communities for their assent is of course essential, but getting that assent by burying geological problems under layers of cash will only see those problems rise, zombie-like, from the grave in future. Second, after half a century of nuclear power and its ever-growing waste pile, isn't it astonishing that no-one anywhere on the planet has demonstrated a permanent way to deal with it? All the while, the costs to the public of keeping this toxic legacy safe on the surface continue to spiral out of control. Yet, despite only having sticking plaster solutions to the waste problem to hand, the UK government and others are dead set on building a new fleet of reactors. Perhaps most worrying of all is that whatever the result of the votes in Cumbria, ministers will undoubtedly keep digging themselves deeper into the nuclear hole. Dealing with legacy waste is unavoidable but adding to this apparently unsolvable problem is not. Phasing out nuclear power is challenging in terms of energy policy, but a breeze compared to the long-term waste problem. The backing of new reactors once again shows the triumph of the short-term political fix over the genuine long-term solution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2014/nov/18/tony-abbott-and-narendra-modi-share-high-hopes-for-bright-trading-future","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-18T01:18:32Z","webTitle":"Tony Abbott and Narendra Modi agree to hold regular joint military exercises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/18/tony-abbott-and-narendra-modi-share-high-hopes-for-bright-trading-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2014/nov/18/tony-abbott-and-narendra-modi-share-high-hopes-for-bright-trading-future","fields":{"headline":"Tony Abbott and Narendra Modi agree to hold regular joint military exercises","bodyText":"Joint Indian and Australian naval exercises will become regular events and defence chiefs and ministers will meet more often under a “security co-operation framework” agreed by Tony Abbott and Narendra Modi. Details of the agreement were not released, but in a statement the prime ministers said it would include defence, counter-terrorism, cyber policy, disarmament and non-proliferation and maritime security, as well as research and defence-related industries. Modi and Abbott had agreed to “extend defence co-operation to cover research, development and industry engagement. They agreed to hold regular meetings at the level of the defence minister, conduct regular maritime exercises and convene regular navy to navy, air force to air force and army to army staff talks,” the statement said. The defence minister, David Johnston, said Australia and India had already agreed to hold a joint naval exercise by the end of next year – this was announced two years ago – and he would discuss further co-operation with his Indian counterpart early next year. The two prime ministers also predicted a pickup in the lacklustre trade relationship between Australia and India – particularly for Australian exports of coal, uranium and services – as the Indian prime minister addressed the Australian parliament. “There are few countries in the world where we see so much synergy as we do in Australia. India is a nation of more than a billion seeking development. Australia a developed country of a few million people and vast resources,” Modi said. “I see Australia as a major partner in every area of our national priority, providing skills and education to our youth, a roof over every head and electricity in every household … energy that does not cause our glaciers to melt, clean coal and gas, renewable energy and fuel for nuclear power … India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities. “The economic climate in India has changed. I believe it will be a lot easier to convert opportunities into concrete outcomes.” With two-way trade between the countries currently at just $15bn and falling, Abbott set a late 2015 deadline for a new free trade agreement. “If all goes to plan next year, an Indian company will begin the development of Australia’s largest coal mine which will light the lives of 100 million Indians for the next half-century,” he said. “And if all goes to plan Australia will export uranium to India under suitable safeguards, of course, because cleaner energy is one of the most important contributions that Australia can make to the wider world. “By the end of next year we will have a free trade deal with what is potentially the world’s largest market. And I want to make this declaration here in this parliament: there are two can-do PMs in this chamber today and we will make it happen.” Abbott hailed India as “the emerging democratic superpower in Asia” and said the Australian government wanted to “crank up” the trade relationship between the two countries with “a comprehensive economic partnership agreement”. “This is our moment – Narendra and I [are] determined to absolutely make the most of it,” he said to the Indian prime minister ahead of his address to the parliament. The coal mine Abbott referred to is the $16.5bn Carmichael mine in Queensland’s Galilee basin, proposed by Indian company Adani. Low coal prices have led many analysts and major investment banks to cast strong doubt on the project’s viability. On Monday the Queensland government signed an “infrastructure enabling agreement” with Adani to provide an unspecified amount of money, somewhere in the “hundreds of millions”, to help the company build a 388km railway line between the mine and the Abbot Point port. And Adani announced it had secured from the State Bank of India a credit facility of up to US$1bn “subject to the detailed assessment of the company’s mine”. Both agreements may help the company convince its would-be investors, but the director of energy finance studies for the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, Tim Buckley, said its future was still far from clear. “I have not spoken to a single person in finance who thinks this can proceed or that it is commercially viable. Eight major international banks have said they won’t go near it,” he said. On the subject of security, the two leaders issued a joint statement. “The framework demonstrates the unshakeable resolve of the two countries in combating and defeating terrorism, including the threat posed by foreign fighters joining extremist groups,” it said. In his address, Modi said Australia and India needed “to work together, and with others, to create an environment and culture that promotes the currency of co-existence and co-operation in which all nations small and big abide by international law and norms … even when they have bitter disputes”. Like the British prime minister, David Cameron, last week, Modi joked about Abbott’s now famous threat to “shirtfront” the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at last weekend’s G20 meeting. “[I am] the third head of government you are listening to this week. I do not know how you are doing this. Maybe this is PM Abbott’s way of shirtfronting you,” he said. Both leaders made the inevitable cricket references. “We celebrate the legend of Bradman and the class of Tendulkar together,” Modi said. Dr Meera Ashar, the deputy director of the south Asia research institute at the Australian National University, said the fact that both prime ministers and the Australian opposition leader resorted to hailing the virtues of democracy and the two countries’ love of cricket “shows that the relationship remains pretty superficial as it stands”. Australia and India signed an agreement to allow Australian uranium exports to India when Abbott visited India in September, but uranium shipments were not expected to begin for several years. India is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Abbott said that even in Australia Modi’s victory in May “inspired hope because Australians too believe in … doing things for love, not just for money, and in living our ideals”, and said both Gandhi and Mother Teresa’s teaching “taught that good words are next to nothing without good deeds”. Talking about increased cultural ties, Modi – a keen yoga practitioner – said he was aware that yoga was “enormously popular” in Australia. Modi is the first Indian leader to visit Australia in 28 years and the first ever to address the federal parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2014/jul/12/this-weeks-new-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-12T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"Boyhood, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Begin Again: this week’s new films","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/12/this-weeks-new-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/12/this-weeks-new-films","fields":{"headline":"Boyhood, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Begin Again: this week’s new films","bodyText":"Boyhood (15) (Richard Linklater, 2014, US) Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Lorelei Linklater. 166 mins The 12-year shooting schedule of this real-time coming of age is more than just a gimmick.

Roberto Adinolfi, the chief executive of Ansaldo Nucleare, was leaving his home in Genoa when a man wearing a motorcycle helmet shot him in the leg with a Tokarev pistol before escaping with an accomplice on a stolen black moped, which was later found by police. Adinolfi's right knee was fractured in the attack but was he not in a serious condition. Shooting victims in the legs was a speciality of the Italian Red Brigades, the terrorist organisation which sought to destabilise the Italian government with a series of kidnappings and murders, culminating in the snatching and killing of the former prime minister Aldo Moro in 1978. The group also shot at three executives at companies in the Ansaldo group and kidnapped another in the 1970s, raising suspicions that Monday's shooting was designed to send a message. \"It is like they wanted to say: 'Let's start again like 40 years ago',\" one source told Italian news agency Ansa, adding that the attack could be a signal to sleeper cells to launch their own operations. Genoa's chief prosecutor, Michele Di Lecce, said he could not rule out that the shooting was an act of \"terrorism\" but added that no one had yet claimed responsibility. Investigators were also quoted as saying they suspected far-left or anarchist groups, which are known to be active in Genoa and which recently advocated \"armed action\". \"We don't know who it was but I suspect it was a small group, possibly anarchists, rather than the Red Brigades, even if the continuation of the economic crisis increases the risk of the return to action of larger groups,\" Stefano Silvestri, a security expert at the Italian thinktank IAI, told the Guardian. In December an Italian anarchist group claimed responsibility for a letter bomb sent to the headquarters of tax collection agency Equitalia, which nearly blinded a manager. \"If [anarchists] have not yet killed someone it is just by chance,\" Italy's senior police officer, Antonio Manganelli, warned a parliamentary hearing in February. The shooting comes as the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, seeks to lower Italy's soaring debt by increasing taxes and cutting pensions, just as the country's unemployment figures soar. In the latest of a string of suicides linked to the economic crisis a 52-year old estate agent hanged himself in a playground near a primary school in Vicenza on Monday. Last week an armed man briefly took hostages at an Equitalia office near Milan in protest at taxes. Monday's attack was \"a worrying sign of growing tensions and violence\", in Italy, said Pier Luigi Bersani, head of the centre-left Democratic party. \"Light should be shed on this incident and democracy should be defended,\" he said, adding that Italy \"has already paid a heavy price in blood\". As Italy's welfare and employment minister, Elsa Fornero, seeks to loosen Italy's rigid employment laws she has been placed under guard following the murders by the Red Brigades in 1999 and 2002 of two government advisers who also sought ways to allow firms to hire and fire more easily. In 2003 two suspected Red Brigades members shot dead a policeman who asked for their documents on a train. Finmeccanica, the state controlled Italian defence company which has a majority stake in Ansaldo Nucleare, is seeking to increase efficiency at group level by reducing staff numbers, prompting protests during which employees have blocked roads and railways. Finmeccanica's chief financial officer, Alessandro Pansa, said the firm would not be \"intimidated\" by the shooting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/aug/03/bob-hawke-nuclear-waste-storage-could-end-indigenous-disadvantage","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-03T00:56:39Z","webTitle":"Bob Hawke: nuclear waste storage could end Indigenous disadvantage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/03/bob-hawke-nuclear-waste-storage-could-end-indigenous-disadvantage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/aug/03/bob-hawke-nuclear-waste-storage-could-end-indigenous-disadvantage","fields":{"headline":"Bob Hawke: nuclear waste storage could end Indigenous disadvantage","bodyText":"Australia could end the disadvantage endured by its Indigenous population by opening up traditional lands as dumping sites for nuclear waste from around the world, a former prime minister, Bob Hawke, has said. Hawke said he was confident that the answer to long-standing indigenous socioeconomic problems was to allow radioactive waste to be stored on Aboriginal land, and use the revenue to improve living standards. Speaking at the Indigenous Garma festival in the Northern Territory, Hawke said he had met Adam Giles, the territory’s chief minister, to discuss the idea and had got a favourable response. “We need to do something substantial to finally eliminate these disgraceful gaps in well-being and lifetime opportunities,” Hawke said. “I have no hesitation whatsoever in putting the situation in very specific terms because I believe I have the answer. “I’ve discussed this proposal with Adam Giles, who tells me he’s been approached by a number of elders who, like himself, are keenly supportive of the proposal.” Despite having some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world, Australia has maintained a long-standing opposition to nuclear power and storing radioactive waste from overseas. In June, traditional Indigenous owners in Muckaty Station, north of Tennant Creek, triumphed in a seven-year battle to stop domestic nuclear waste being dumped on their land. The site was officially nominated for radioactive dumping but four different clans claimed they had not been consulted and that the site was near a sacred area. The Northern Land Council, which made the nomination, relented amid a challenge in the federal court. Hawke, who was prime minister between 1983 and 1991, said any nuclear waste dumping would need Indigenous leaders’ full consent, but he stressed that the solution would give Australia “the capacity for substantial new expenditure on indigenous Australians”. He said that towards the end of his premiership in 1991, he asked the then chief scientist, Ralph Slatyer, to investigate the possibility of storing nuclear waste in remote locations in Australia. The report found that “Australia has the safest remote geological formations in the world for this purpose, in the Northern Territory and, to some extent, in Western Australia”, Hawke said. “Our friends in the environmental movement say the challenge of climate change is a global one requiring international co-operation, and they are right,” he said. “With Australia having the safest nuclear disposal sites in the world, we have a responsibility and obligation to make these sites available for this purpose. “In creating a safer energy cycle for a world threatened by global warming, we would not only be doing good for the rest of the world, we would be doing enormous good for Australia as the world would pay handsomely for this service. “In other words, we make the world a safer place, we earn an enormous amount of new money, and we use that money to help close these unacceptable gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.” Dave Sweeney, a nuclear-free campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Hawke’s proposal was a “bloody disgrace”. “Here you’ve got a privileged white man standing up saying this rubbish should be dumped on systematically disadvantaged people’s land,” he told Guardian Australia. “It’s offensive and it’s dumb. “For more than 20 years Aboriginal communities at multiple sites in South Australia and the NT have mobilised and defeated federal government plans for a national radioactive waste dump on their country, most recently at Muckaty. To think that they will accept an international dump is fanciful. “To put forward that the best way to address the shameful state of the economic and structural disadvantage of the world’s oldest continuing culture is through hosting the world’s worst industrial wastes is a profound and perpetual policy failure.” In his Garma speech, Hawke said he was “sick and tired” of the impasse in improving the fortunes of Indigenous people. He said he was saddened that he was never able to strike a treaty with Indigenous people while he was prime minister, but he said he fully supported the present move to recognise Aboriginal heritage in the constitution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2015/nov/14/babies-an-impossible-dream-the-millennials-priced-out-of-parenthood","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-14T10:30:49Z","webTitle":"'Babies?

An impossible dream': the millennials priced out of parenthood","bodyText":"Which rites of passage make an adult? Is it being able to live independently, without parental support? Having a stable career? Being married or making a lifelong commitment? Owning your own home? Or is it being responsible for the wellbeing of another human life – in other words, becoming a parent yourself? These are the traditional markers of adulthood; of stability, responsibility and independence. From an early age, most of us grow up thinking that we will achieve some, if not all, of these things. But if you asked me, a 28-year-old woman, whether I fulfilled most of these criteria, you’d have to deduce that I am, essentially, living a prolonged adolescence. I live in a shared, rented flat with my long-term boyfriend and another flatmate, where the rent will remain affordable only if the landlords decline to hike it again (last year we had a £300 a month increase). I have a freelance income that fluctuates wildly. I’m in no position to get a mortgage – not just in London, but anywhere in the UK (even if the latter were a possibility, I’d have to move to a part of the country where there is very little of the work I rely upon). Asking my parents for a deposit is not an option, nor is it for my boyfriend (and why should they give us money? I worry enough as it is about how they will get by in old age). As I approach my 30s, I can’t help worrying: what happens when I decide I want a baby? The average age of British mothers hit 30 for the first time in 2013. This is often framed as a result of women “choosing” to focus on careers before they decide to have children. Very little has been said about those women – or, indeed, couples – who want to have children, but whose circumstances prevent them from doing so. I have always known that I wanted children and, because of disabilities in my family, I was told it would be better for me to do it young (or, at least, before I was 30 or so). But I graduated into the recession and, following a number of unpaid internships and a couple of years spent establishing a still unpredictable freelance career, I only just feel as though I’m getting on my feet. The idea of having a baby in my current situation is unthinkable. For a start, I couldn’t afford to take maternity leave, and the state maternity allowance of £139.58 a week would nowhere near cover us. I long ago accepted that I wouldn’t own a house by the time I got pregnant, and was never prepared to let that get in my way. I was born into a shared house myself – but it was a big, alternative co-op and my parents lived in the attic. What single young professional flatmate is going to put up with a screaming baby in a tiny two-bed? Not one I know. These hurdles to the world of adulthood continue to be a great source of sadness and anxiety, and I’m not alone. For swathes of people in their 20s and 30s, who largely thought they would be at least a bit sorted by now, achieving the adult lives they want seems a distant fantasy. Spiralling property prices coupled with the fetishisation of housing as an investment – expressed through buy-to-let properties and often poor rental conditions – means secure housing is off the table for many of us as we continue to subsidise our much richer landlords. The average price for a starter home rose to £211,000 this year, requiring an average deposit of 17%, or £36,000. The recession, unstable and unreliable unemployment, low pay compounded by a pensions shortfall and an ageing population, have all led to a situation in which many members of my generation feel not only short-changed, but helpless when it comes to building some semblance of a stable family life. While our generational predecessors, the baby boomers, reaped the rewards of free university education and affordable property prices, we have been disproportionately affected by austerity. Andrea, 30, is a university administrator from Bradford. “I’d love to start a family,” she says, “but that’s just not going to happen and it really, really upsets me. I spend hours looking at Facebook at the photos of my friends’ babies, and making presents for them – I learned to knit a few years ago and have made various booties, hats and coats. I get a lot of compliments at baby showers. I hate baby showers. I do all this knowing that it can’t happen for me because of the hours I have to work in order to have a career, in order to have any kind of job security.” Andrea works a 45-hour week, commuting for three hours a day, but still feels home ownership is not a realistic prospect. “I’d probably get a mortgage, but where the hell are we supposed to find £10K-plus for a deposit from?” The challenges that young women like Andrea are facing when it comes to settling down are compounded, she says, by that perennial difficulty of balancing a career with having children. “Within my industry, the women in positions of power are either non-parents, or came to the industry after they had children. I don’t know one woman in the grades above mine who has young children.” Andrea’s situation is compounded by the media coverage of pregnancy statistics. “Those ‘Have a baby by 30 or you’re sterile, you selfish career-driven hussy’ headlines,” she says. Andrea wanted to remain anonymous, as did most of the people I spoke to, for various reasons. Generation Y are used to being accused of whining when we talk about our frustrations, and we are sensitive to that. We’ve been brought up in a somewhat status-obsessed society, too, so mentioning financial difficulties leads to feelings of shame. Some young women were concerned that admitting to the desperate desire for a child might harm their career prospects. But by far the most commonly cited reason is that they didn’t want to hurt their parents’ feelings by discussing how, in contrast to the parents of some of their peers, they are unable to give them that vital leg up. Everyone I spoke to wanted to stand on their own two feet, but they were aware that their parents shared their feelings of powerlessness and sadness. “It would kill my father to have this printed,” one woman said. “He’s a proud man.” On the whole, our parents’ generation is far better off. “The recent living standards squeeze has played out differently across the generations,” says Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation. “Younger people experienced the sharpest increase in unemployment and the biggest fall in pay, while employment among older people has surged. These shifts have been amplified by welfare changes, with cuts to working age benefits contrasting with protections for pensioners. But there was evidence of a divergence in experience even before the financial crisis hit. Rising housing costs have further widened the divide between Generation Rent and the baby boomers.” Jealousy towards baby boomers is an everyday occurrence. You’ll be sitting in a bar with friends and hear them lament the fact that their parents had bought a house by the time they were 27. “My mother had already had me and my sister by the time she was my age,” one friend said gloomily when the subject came up. Generation Y – or millennials, if you must – are still often portrayed as existing in a state of perpetual kidulthood; we’re Peter Pans who never want to grow up. Yet many of us are desperate to do so. Unaffordable housing and living costs are often portrayed as a “London problem”. “Why not simply move?” detractors say, as though career opportunity, family ties or personal finances are not an issue. Yet I spoke to people in their 20s and 30s from all over the UK, and many felt the same way: that their chances of getting to the point where they are stable enough to settle down and have children are slim to none. Many of them feel great sadness about this, not only because they look to their parents’ generation and see opportunities they’ve never had, but because a gulf is opening within our own generation – between those who can start a family or whose parents can help them get on the property ladder, and those who can’t. “The number of people who have said I should ask my dad for a deposit,” Andrea says. “As if his life doesn’t matter any more… My dad might live for another 20 years – I hope he does – and his care will cost. He needs his money.” While Andrea’s work life is relatively stable, Sophie, who is 26, feels her employment circumstances mean that having a baby is off-limits. “Since graduating, I’ve had a series of jobs that don’t equal a career. I’ve recently left my job, and am doing temp work and a vocational course that should get me to where I want to be, finally,” she says, adding that she wouldn’t have been able to do this without the support of her partner, who, at 37, is more established. “I would like reasonable maternity pay and a role to return to after having a baby,” Sophie says. “But that seems like an almost impossible dream.” She worries about her partner, too. “When I think about the time it might take me to be well established in a new career – four years? – I think about my partner’s worry that he will be an old father, and won’t have the time to be a good grandfather.” The more people I spoke to, the more apparent it became that this is not just about generational divides, but about class. Interviewees were forever mentioning friends or acquaintances who had been privileged enough to buy, while those from low-income backgrounds lost out. Ciara, 25, from a town in the south-east, graduated three years ago into an unstable work environment, where she struggled to find a job that wasn’t an unpaid internship. She now has one, but is saddled with enormous student debt and still lives at home, angry at the failure of politicians to support her generation. “My parents are hardcore Conservatives who can’t understand why I am so frustrated with this government, who, I believe, are deliberately limiting social mobility for working-class single people,” she says. “They blame a Labour government who ‘gave too much to too many’, while wondering why my younger sister, who is ex-military, and I haven’t moved out.” “I got pregnant, accidentally, two years ago. My boyfriend and I desperately wanted a child, but knew we had nowhere to live and no means to support it. Instead of living in fear of raising it in what could ultimately have been poverty, in a society that refused to help support us, we had no choice but to end the pregnancy. I’ve been in grief counselling for a year to come to terms with that decision.” Ciara is scared she won’t ever get the chance to have a family. “My mother reminds me that, at my age, she had been married for five years and had me for four. At 25, I can’t even imagine having a one-bedroom flat to myself, or a husband, or the baby I so badly want. I’m terrified that in the next five years I’ll still be no closer to that.” And that’s the worry: so many of us are fearful that, even as we become older and perhaps gain a bit more stability at work, or a leg up on to the property ladder, bringing up children will still be all but impossible. Steve, 37, lives with his girlfriend in a house near Cardiff that they were able to buy because of an inheritance; but despite them both being self-employed in marketing, and earning a regular salary apiece, he says that “long-term planning is impossible”. “Neither of us have pensions, sick pay, holiday pay, life insurance. Taking a summer break is nigh on impossible. There is no way we could have kids, despite both us of us wanting to. No way. We’d lose one salary, and even with welfare support, we could not give a child the right kind of environment to thrive. Let’s be honest, you need to give way more than just love.” Hiran, 37, tells of how his mother came to this country from east Africa when she was 19. “She earned £7 a week doing factory work. By the time she was my age, she had saved enough to get married, have two children of secondary school age, had bought her council house and mortgaged it to buy a shop.” In contrast, Hiran and his brother live at home, both earning less than £7 an hour. “If you are drowning in debt, it closes the door on going to bars and nightclubs, or spending money on hobbies that could lead to intimate relationships. With no money to socialise, we’re left playing computer games in our rooms. We might as well be 15. Marriage, kids, mortgage? No chance. Without our parents’ pension, we couldn’t eat. As they get older, their assets will have to be sold to pay for their care, and then my brother and I are likely to face middle age dependent on the state.” Some might argue that expectations are now simply too high. Thea, 26, certainly thinks so. “I come from a working-class background, so, while I have had some financial help from my parents when I’ve been desperate – I’m talking a couple of hundred quid a month – the onus has always been on me to achieve and get where I want to be in life. I’ve not had anything ‘handed’ to me, like a house or substantial amount of money that would help me settle down in future.” But it doesn’t bother her too much. “My upbringing and background have helped me accept my current situation. Despite not having much money as a kid – we never went abroad, for example – I never felt I missed out on anything. I do think my expectations of what constitute necessities – foreign holidays, owning a house or car – are lower than those of some of my peers who had more middle-class upbringings.” Thea has never wanted children and, as an only child, knows that she will inherit her parents’ house when they die. “I think the country, as far as wages, property, poverty and my generation actually being able to build secure finances, is in an absolute state and something undoubtedly needs to be done. But I also think part of the problem is that so many people go to uni now: it devalues a degree (I don’t have one) and doesn’t guarantee anyone a job. So you’re left with broke, unemployed twentysomethings in debt.” She has a point: those of my friends who had children young and didn’t go to university now have older children and are in a position where they can enter higher education or retrain. But that’s not to say it’s been easy – they have struggled financially, often as single parents. More flexibility in education would help but, as almost everyone I speak to says, and Jessica, 25, articulates, “The main thing the government needs to do is build more bloody houses.” “It’s sad,” Jessica adds, “because I’ve convinced myself I don’t want a marriage, mortgage or kids. But I genuinely see them as impossible, and that’s probably why.” She does think moving to London has been a factor. “Renting a room any bigger than about two metres wide, in a flatshare, is unattainable.” She feels she is being penalised for being ambitious. As Kirsten, a 32-year-old legal-aid lawyer specialising in human rights, says, “Why shouldn’t a professional woman in her 30s be able to afford to live in, not the centre, but even the very outskirts of our capital city?” She currently shares an overcrowded house with four others. “I’m an adult, but am not able to live like an adult. London’s housing market has trapped me – paying high rent that prevents me from saving anything towards a deposit for a flat. It would be hard for me to move out of London and find a similar job and, in any event, I feel resentful at that suggestion.” Besides, to suggest that being somewhere cheaper solves the problem is simplistic. Chloe is 29 and moved to London from the north-east a year ago due to a lack of jobs. “I’d like to have kids, but don’t really feel in a much better position to do so than I did when I was 20. The ‘one day’ seems to be stretching way in to my 30s, and that’s pretty concerning, especially when there’s so much talk about biological clocks. My 20s have felt like a very extended teenage period, in terms of financial circumstances rather than mindset. I remain optimistic and resourceful, and I don’t have crazy expectations, but I think that this might continue for a while yet.” In David Willetts’s book The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Stole Their Children’s Future, he describes Britain as the “first nuclear power”. He’s talking about the nuclear family, something he argues is a long-standing feature of Anglophone societies, in contrast to countries on the continent, where property is transmitted through larger familial networks. Because we are a nation made up of small families and focused on private property, we need the state more, because there is less to fall back on. It follows that when the system fails or gets into difficulty, the nuclear family suffers. Everyone I spoke to for this article felt a responsibility not to bring children into an environment that was economically precarious; but I wonder how long people are willing to sacrifice future parenthood because of this. If we all go ahead and have babies anyway, what will be the consequences for the state? It’s ironic that a government so ostensibly dedicated to notions of “family” is giving little help to those who desire nothing more. Communal living is already a reality for many people, as overcrowded houses and boomerang children demonstrate. Do we all just need to learn to live with other people’s babies? Moving abroad is one solution, as Eleanor, 30, explains. “I honestly don’t see a way that I will be able to raise children in the UK. If I look at my peers from school and university, most have left for Australia and the US, and I don’t blame them. They seem really happy elsewhere – wages are lower, but their standard of living is higher. I would like to have children in the UK, because my parents and my partner’s parents live here, but it would be too much of a struggle. And I can’t afford to live near my family, who might otherwise be able to help me if childcare was ever an issue. I am barely able to make ends meet as things are. It’s heartbreaking.” Andrea agrees: “There are days I wish I could just take the baby-brain out, when I just feel so sad about it. I don’t know if it’s because I’ve lost my mum, so don’t really have that unconditional love with anyone any more – but I just feel like my arms are empty.” She won’t feel complete until she has a baby. Until then, she says, “I’m not fulfilling what I’m supposed to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2014/nov/19/the-iran-nuclear-talks-too-big-to-fail","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-19T10:43:10Z","webTitle":"The Iran nuclear talks: Too big to fail? | Julian Borger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2014/nov/19/the-iran-nuclear-talks-too-big-to-fail","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2014/nov/19/the-iran-nuclear-talks-too-big-to-fail","fields":{"headline":"The Iran nuclear talks: Too big to fail?","bodyText":"Among all the rubble left by decades of distrust littering the road to a nuclear deal, there is one outsize boulder that dwarfs the rest. For domestic political reasons, the Obama administration needs to demonstrate that Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium has been radically shrunk by any deal signed in Vienna. The Rouhani government has to demonstrate the very opposite in Tehran. The fixation with the number of centrifuges is nonsensical on both sides. Iran does not need its existing enrichment capacity for its nuclear energy needs in the foreseeable future. Russia is contracted to supply the fuel for the Bushehr reactor until 2021, and ready to do so after that. The warranty on the Russian-built nuclear power station would be void if Iran used home-enriched fuel. It would be a dangerous thing to do. The contract for the two new reactors Moscow is going to build at Bushehr, with an option for six more, also envisages Russian-supplied fuel. The US fixation on centrifuge numbers is only slightly less absurd. The idea is that Iran’s ‘breakout time’ (the period it would theoretically take for Tehran to amass enough fissile material for a warhead) should be at least a year. That implies an enrichment capacity of less than 4,000 SWU (separative work units) roughly equivalent to 4,000 of Iran’s current, inefficient centrifuges. At the moment, Iran has about 10,200 centrifuges in operation (out of a total of 19,000 installed). The Obama administration has boxed itself in by making a year’s breakout the virtually sole measure of success at the talks. It seems to have drifted into it. Back in April, Secretary of State John Kerry was talking more vaguely of six to twelve months, but in subsequent briefings to Congress, state department officials seemed to have reverted to reverted to the single, higher target. This does not add up from an international security point of view. As many arms control experts have pointed out, if Iran wanted to make a bomb, ‘breaking out’ using its declared facilities is the least likely route. It would almost to be spotted long before making a single warhead, and provide a clear casus belli for its enemies. As James Acton at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and others have pointed out, the much greater risk is Iran ‘sneaking out’, constructing a covert parallel programme. So failing to agree a deal that would have entrenched greater monitoring and transparency, only because it fell short of guaranteeing a year’s ‘breakout’ time would be a loss for security and non-proliferation. As Kelsey Davenport, the director of nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association said: The centrifuge number has become symbolic of the deal itself. It’s being measured by a single metric. But if you have daily access to enrichment sites, and you can detect deviation within days, and you have months to respond. This blinkered vision is one reason for pessimism. The other is the complex interlocking nature of sanctions. Obama cannot lift sanctions imposed by Congress. He can only waive them temporarily. The EU can vote to lift its oil and banking embargoes, but the experience of the interim deal agreed last November suggests that a partial easing restrictive measures only has a limited and delayed effect. Banks are risk-averse and will not handle Iranian payments if they think they might be sanctioned later under US law, determined by a Republican Congress. The right to sell oil again is of limited benefit if Iran cannot get access to the revenue. Looked on from Rouhani’s point of view, he risks coming away from Vienna with paper concessions that shrivel up on his return to Tehran. In a meeting between Kerry and Zarif in Oman earlier this month, aimed at breaking the deadlock before this week’s Vienna talks, the Iranian delegation made an offer to ship almost all its stock of low-enriched Uranium Hexafluoride to Russia. This is significant because this UF6 gas is the form in which uranium can be enriched further, so it is the starting point of any bid to make high enriched uranium for a bomb. According to Davenport’s calculations, shipping out all the UF6 would double Iran’s ‘breakout’ time from three to six months, with its current stock of about 10,000 operating centrifuges. The Associated Press cites diplomats that Iran could be ready to come down to 8,000 centrifuges (or SWU equivalent). With near-zero UF6 stocks, that would stretch ‘breakout’ to eight months. But for those concessions, Iran would want something solid on sanctions. Zarif has argued that if Obama cannot permanently lift US sanctions, Iran should be freed of UN Security Council restrictive measures. That might be difficult for the arms embargo and restrictions on dual use technology, but possible for banking and other economic restrictions. The potential for this sort of creativity gives some room for optimism. A far more solid foundation for hope is the potentially catastrophic consequences of failure. A hardline US Congress, following the Republican capture of the Senate this month, is preparing to pass new sanctions that Obama would find it hard to veto, or at least sustain a veto, in the absence of a deal. New sanctions would in turn draw a response from Iranian hardliners in the Majlis. They would demand Iran shrug off the restrictions accepted as part of last November’s interim deal and resume production of ‘medium-enriched’ 20% uranium, for example. That would bring back the threat of military action from Israel. This prospect should keep all the parties in Vienna from declaring failure if there is no deal on November 24. They are more likely to ask for an extension and if possible come out with a piece of paper outlining a framework for agreement or a set of principles. But extension will not make it an easier to make a deal. It could instead make it harder as opponents of an agreement rally against what they will portray as diplomats playing for time. Failure would be a heavy setback for both Obama and Rouhani. But there are worrying signs that Rouhani is making preparations for a Plan B, that would help him to survive collapse in Vienna or its aftermath. That involves rhetoric, repeated by Zarif on arrival in Vienna, blaming the West in advance for ‘excessive demands’. It also involves signing deals and memoranda of understanding with Russia and China, as an alternative to the full reintegration in the global economy Tehran was hoping for. Such solutions remain a distant second-best for Iran, however. Rouhani won the presidency on the promise of fixing the country’s relations with the rest of the world. His plans for the economy are based on it. The Supreme Leader appears to share those economic goals. He appears well aware of the terrible consequences of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s mismanagement. With a little more creativity over sanctions and centrifuges, there are still precarious grounds for hope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/mar/16/tony-benn-tributes-tribune-of-left","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-16T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Tributes to a tribune of the left: Tony Benn | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/16/tony-benn-tributes-tribune-of-left","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/mar/16/tony-benn-tributes-tribune-of-left","fields":{"headline":"Tributes to a tribune of the left: Tony Benn","bodyText":"Your main coverage of the death of Tony Benn (Obituary, 15 March; Michael White, 15 March) was ungenerous, and did little justice to the man who was one of the most loved political figures in Britain today. Millions were inspired by his principles, his commitment and his unswerving support for many campaigns. He was president of the Stop the War Coalition right up to his death and helped initiate the People's Assembly in opposition to government policies of austerity and inequality. Far from having little influence on politics and change, Tony was in the forefront of opposing wars, apartheid, racism and sexism. In this he was often in advance of establishment opinion, but equally often in agreement with public opinion. He was loved precisely because he did articulate views shared by many outside the corridors of power. Your tendency to point-scoring about arguments dating back more than 30 years and refusal to seriously address his views perhaps demonstrates that they had more purchase than his opponents care to admit. Those who support trade unions, equality, peace and – dare we say it – socialism have little voice in the media or established politics. They have lost a great champion in Tony Benn. His political legacy will hopefully be measured by their future success.

It's difficult to imagine anyone better to puncture of the bubble of hagiography filling much of Saturday's coverage (the main obit and Michael White being honourable exceptions). It's hard to know whether Simon would have taken more delight pointing out how wrong Benn was on so many issues (nationalisation, the EU, Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Mao, Labour's election loss in '83, the miners' strike and many others) or in reminiscing about how Benn's extreme vanity blinded him to the damage he did to Labour in the 1980s. Perhaps it would simply have been enough to remember how much Benn hated those (like Simon himself) who saw through the cheap and easy platitudes that characterised his later career. Dr John McGowan Lewes, East Sussex • I was disappointed by the mealy-mouthed obituary of Tony Benn by Professor Brian Brivati. I was surprised you chose him to write such an important political obituary, as he is a member of the misnamed \"Progress group\" and a friend of leading New Labour so-called liberal international interventionists. Prof Brivati asserts that from the mid-1970s onwards, Benn had nothing new to say as a political thinker. This is certainly contestable. One example will suffice to demonstrate this inaccuracy. Tony Benn, who once was responsible for the British nuclear power programme, first when he when he was technology minister in the late 1960s, and later after he was \"demoted\" (in Brivati's interpretation), was asked a few years ago by the Times if he had made any political mistakes in his life. He responded: \"Nuclear power. I was told, when I was in charge of it, that atomic energy was cheap, safe and peaceful. It isn't.\" A serious problem for today's politics is that both coalition ministers and their Labour opponents have not learned from Benn's conversion on the road to energy sustainability, and support new nuclear. Dr David Lowry Environmental policy and research consultant • Your online report on the death of Tony Benn (14 March) attributed his defeat in the 1981 Labour deputy leadership to a late voting shift by a key union. I presume that this is a reference to NUPE, which in fact followed the clear verdict of a ballot of its members. Had Labour's largest union, the TGWU, showed similar respect for its members, Denis Healey would have won overwhelmingly. Benn's achievements and personality have attracted many tributes, but his campaign in 1981 was one of the most selfish and unprincipled in British political history.

Less than an hour previously, Moore and O’Brien had teamed up to win the Ribblesdale Stakes with Even Song, notching up a half-centurty of Royal Ascot winners for the Master of Ballydoyle. It is a remarkable feat the 46-year-old has achieved in less than 20 years as a trainer. Prince Of Lir, trained by Robert Cowell and ridden by Luke Morris, got the afternoon’s proceedings under way with victory in the Norfolk Stakes, before Godolphin secured their fourth winner of the meeting when William Buick and Hawkbill won the Tercentenary Stakes for trainer Charlie Appleby. Jamie Spencer got off the mark for this Royal meeting when he won the Britannia Stakes for trainer Jamie Osbourne after getting the leg-up on favourite Defrocked, while the final race of the day, the King George V Stakes, went to Primitivo and William Twiston-Davies, riding for Alan King. 1 Primitivo (William Twiston-Davies) 13-2 2 Platitude (R L Moore) 12-1 3 Harrison (S De Sousa) 8-1 4 The Major General (D O’Brien) 14-1 16 ran Also: 5-2 Fav Shraaoh Non Runners: 9,11 CSF: 82.79 Tricast: 641.64 Primitivo wins, but there’s bad news for the royal connections of Guy Fawkes, the Queen’s horse which suffered a bad fall in the early stages of the race. It looks like he’s suffered a fatal injury. They’re away and running in the final race of the day and royal runner Guy Fawkes has fallen. Jockey Pat Smullen is back on his feet, but it doesn’t look great for the horse ... Navajo War Dance leads them into the home turn, with Juste Pour Nous upsides him ... Primitivo leads them into the final furlong ... he wins it for trainer Alan King and jockey William Twiston-Davies. Primitivo wins the King George V Stakes.

Guy Fawkes (a son of Big Bad Bob) ran a really pleasing trial at Redcar but might not want any further rainfall today. Godolphin, Charlie Appleby and William Buick were the team that bagged this prize last year and they have the favourite this time, Lovell, who got going too late on his reappearance and could only get second but has scope to do better over this extra distance and looks well handicapped. Shraaoh (Sir Michael Stoute) has a bit to prove after winning just a maiden, a point that also applies to Point Of View. Primitivo, the winner of his last three, is much more experienced, getting better each time and versatile as to ground. 1 Defrocked (J P Spencer) 13-2 2 Abe Lincoln (Jim Crowley) 20-1 3 Chief Whip (S M Levey) 12-1 4 Arcanada (M Harley) 66-1 28 ran Also: 11-2 Fav Out And About Non Runner: 24 Withdrawn: 4 Tote: win 8.90 places 2.90 7.80 3.50 20.50 Tote Exacta: 339.30 CSF: 143.07 Tricast: 1640.72 No 4 Perkunas (50-1) was withdrawn not under orders. Rule 4 does not apply. Defrocked wins the Britannia under Jamie Spencer for trainer Jamie Osbourne! Abe Lincoln was second. Defrocked was lucky there; he hung very badly in the closing stages. The field sets off without Perkunas, who spread a plate down at the start and was withdrawn by connections. There are 28 left and Carrington was slowest away ... the field splits into two groups as Arcanada leads the near side group, while Out And About and Folkswood ... Defrocked hangs badly as Abe Lincoln comes through the centre ... it’s Abe Lincoln and Defrocked in a photo ... Out And About 11-2 Folswood 7-1 Defrocked 7-1 Garcia 8-1 Mustashry 12-1 Manson 12-1 Chief Whip 12-1 14-1 bar Order Of St George ran out an easy winner of the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot. The youngster sprang to prominence when winning the Irish St Leger by 11 lengths last season but had only been seen once since then against inferior opponents. Punters who had backed him into 10-11 favourite would have been panicking with half a mile to run, as Ryan Moore had nowhere to go when stuck in the pack. French raider Mille Et Mille was allowed to set his own pace in front and at one stage was nearly 10 lengths clear before slowing down and kicking clear again. Moore had to bide his time until finding a gap in the straight and as soon as the four-year-old was in the clear he stamped his authority on the contest. Luca Cumani’s Mizzou gave chase in vain up the rail to finish second, while Sheikhzayedroad eventually got in the clear to claim third. In winning a seventh Gold Cup, Aidan O’Brien once again proved he has no peers in training the stayers. “He’s a class horse and class horses win races,” said Aidan O’Brien. “He picked up very well and after two and a half miles, he was pouring it on at the end. PA Sport Like yesterday’s Hunt Cup cavalry charge over a mile, but restricted to three-year-olds. Garcia has, for me, the strongest form after his powerful finish at Haydock but it looks as though he may be drawn on the wrong side. Out And About, another Haydock winner, has a better berth towards the far side and should improve for the extra distance. Oh This Is Us, also drawn in single figures, is proven at a mile, though not on soft ground. Manson is also vulnerable on soft, though his power-packed finish at Sandown last time makes him easy to like. He has this to say about Olivier Peslier’s ride in the Ribblesdale: “I appreciate I’m a bit one-eyed on this, having tipped Queen’s Trust, but what a poor ride that was from Olivier Peslier,” he says. “OK, she didn’t break well, but he stuck her out the back of a big field and widest of all to boot and then stayed there long after it should have been clear that the pace was not strong. He didn’t make a move until the turn for home, at which point it was far too late. Of course, in a special act of cruelty, she then scythed through the field when it was just too late to reach a place. Ugh.” 1 Order Of St George (R L Moore) 10-11 Fav 2 Mizzou (Andrea Atzeni) 10-1 3 Sheikhzayedroad (M Harley) 40-1 17 ran Also: 33-1 Mille Et Mille 4th Non Runner: 2 CSF: 11.00 Tricast: 266.46 Mille Et Mille is really putting the hammer down with a punishing gallop, but comes back to the field as Max Dymnamite makes ground as they approach the final half-mile. The field is well bunched, with Mille Et Mille still in front ... Mille Et Mille from Flying Officer ... here comes Order Of St George ... Order Of St George win by three lengths from Mizzou. Order Of St George wins a punishing Gold Cup for Ryan Moore and Aidan O’Brien. There’s £226,840 in the winner’s purse as this massive Gold Cup field is sent on its way, with Order Of St George the 10-11 favourite. Mizzou, Wasir and The Twisler are all prominent. Mille Et Mille takes up the running from The Twisler as they pass the grandstand ... Mille Et Mille leads from six or seven lengths from The Twisler, who has two or three lengths on Fun Mac in third. Flying Officer is next and then Gririaz ... Order Of St George is well down the field ... Pallasator, a notoriously leery bugger when it comes to travelling down to the start and entering the stalls, has got down to the start, with Oisin Murphy giving him a tender ride with his feet out of the irons. In the parade ring, his trainer Sir Mark Prescott gives the horse’s stable lass all the credit, saying she’s found a way to get into her charge’s head. They’re loading the stalls, not long now ... Even Song justified heavy market support to give Aidan O’Brien his first ever winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes and in the process provide the master of Ballydoyle with his 50th Royal Ascot success. Sent off the 15-8 favourite, Even Song was not too far behind a steady gallop set by Ted Durcan on Shall We. Oaks runner-up Architecture ran keen from a wide draw under Frankie Dettori and gave herself little chance of going one better. Roger Varian’s maiden Ajman Princess had the perfect trip through on the rail and showed a determined attitude, keeping on gamely but she had no answer to Even Song’s turn of foot. Everything opened up in front of Ryan Moore and she soon put the race to bed when asked a question. Even Song powered a length and a half clear of Ajman Princess, with The Black Princess holding off the fast-finishing Queen’s Trust for third. Moore said: “She had a good turn of foot. We did go slow, but she relaxed well and was in tight quarters before we got a gap. “She’s a very good filly. Architecture had a rough trip backing up from the Oaks,” said Moore. “This filly, we thought it was a good spot for her and Aidan has trained her with this mind. Let’s hope he gets to 100 - that would be more special.” Order Of St George 10-11 Max Dynamite 8-1 Flying Officer 10-1 Clever Cookie 12-1 Mizzou 12-1 Pallasator 16-1 Scotland 25-1 40-1 bar Order Of St George is the big, young talent here and comes from the Aidan O’Brien stable that has won this race six times in the past 10 years with three different horses. But things could go wrong for him if, as expected, he is held up towards the rear for this first attempt at two and a half miles. Ryan Moore, who left his challenge too late on The Gurkha on Tuesday, could find himself trying to thread amongst a dozen rivals when it’s time to make his challenge here. A case can be made for a few of the others, especially as their odds are inflated by the market love for the favourite. Max Dynamite only needs to be forgiven his reappearance flop, when he surely needed the run. On his form from the second half of last year, he’s got a great shot. Mizzou has won two good races here and might have matured enough to improve on last year’s seventh. Flying Officer looks a very solid option, though this could be a bit far for him if they go a good gallop. Clever Cookie will have his chance, though the suspicion remains that he’s not quite good enough. So, Ryan Mooore rides Even Song to victory, making it 50 Royal Ascot winners for Aidan O’Brien. Asked if it’s a special moment, Moore says “I’d say it’ll be more special when he gets 100 up.” No51 could come within the hour, as the pair team up on the favourite Order Of St George in the Gold Cup. 1 Even Song (R L Moore) 15-8 Fav 2 Ajman Princess (Andrea Atzeni) 33-1 3 The Black Princess (W Buick) 8-1 14 ran Also: 12-1 Queen’s Trust 4th CSF: 85.72 Tricast: 439.80 They’re away and running and Shall We leads on the inside of Beauly, from Rocaverde ... Shall We continues to lead as they head into the final six furlongs, followed by Beauly as they gallop along at a steady pace ... Shall We continues to loll along in front from Beauly, Ajman Princess on the inside and Rocaverde ... it’s a slow pace ... they head for home and Even Song hits the front, passing Ajman Princess ... Even Song stretches clear to win under Ryan Moore for trainer Aidan O’Brien. Even Song wins the Ribblesdale. Hawkbill had too much pace for Prize Money to give Godolphin a one-two in the Tercentenary Stakes at Royal Ascot. Having enjoyed a a treble on Wednesday Sheikh Mohammed left Ascot a happy man but none of those winners were trained by his main Newmarket men. This time the race was dominated by Charlie Appleby and Saeed bin Suroor, with Appleby’s more experienced Hawkbill coming out on top under William Buick. Race Day, another Godolphin runner, set off at a tremendous gallop, with Prize Money keen in second and Hawkbill in third. Nothing else got into it as with two furlongs left to run the pacemaker dropped away and Hawkbill (11-2) quickened past Prize Money to win his fifth race in a row. Aidan O’Brien’s Long Island Sound stayed on from the rear to claim third but there were only ever two horses in it. “We always knew he was a nice horse, and it was a great ride by William Buick,” said Appleby. “Both myself and Saeed needed pace and Marin Lane did a fantastic job on the pacemaker. William was confident and he is a horse we feel will get a mile and a half. I said the best way to ride him was to ride him like the best horse in the race. “Turning for home, I know they were travelling well in behind, but he was travelling supremely well and he galloped all the way to the line, which he showed he can do at Newmarket.” PA Sport Even Song 9-4 Architecture 3-1 Sovereign Parade 9-1 Queens Trust 10-1 Chicadoro 12-1 The Black Princess 14-1 We Are Ninety 16-1 Olala 20-1 25-1 bar Can we talk about Sophie Wessex’s hat for a minute between races? Yesterday the royals at Ascot tried hard to out do each other with the hats which all seemed to be referencing some food theme -Kate (Middleton/Cambridge/Whatever) wore a pringle crisp in hat form. But today Wessex has opted for a Georgia O’ Keeffe flower reference. (I mean I took the higher cultural ground there and it could have gone either way). Her skirt is a nod to Christian Dior’s New Look which suggests she’s read some sort of A-Z of fashion, but it is her shoes which are really interesting. Hidden platform buttermilk court shoes are practically standard issue for the royal family these days thanks to Princess Kate. So I reckon that the subliminal messaging with this outfit is that yesterday’s Cambridge appearance was merely a blip and that it is Wessex who actually owns royal enclosure chic. Meanwhile we have an unexpected sartorial move from the Queen. But then she’s come over all brave new wardrobe (the neon) since her 90th. She’s usually all over the mono-toning but today she’s experimented with this complicated dual blue/orange thing. The fashion desk’s best guess if that she is, in the absence of actual summer time at Ascot, channeling a summer sky. Which is kind of noble and in the-service-of-one’s-country-ish of her, but also completely futile. Architecture is the obvious one, having run second in the Oaks a fortnight ago, when only the astonishing Minding was good enough to catch her. But that was a tough race on a taxing surface and we saw with A Shin Hikari yesterday that horses are not always able to run two good races on soft in quick succession. Aidan O’Brien fields Even Song, who was a bit unlucky in running when third in a Listed race last month but still has a bit to prove at this level. Newmarket appears to be bursting with promising young fillies, since John Gosden fields a couple, of which Sovereign Parade is the most interesting, while Sir Michael Stoute sends Queen’s Trust, who promises to relish this step up in distance. 1 Hawkbill (W Buick) 11-2 2 Prize Money (James Doyle) 4-1 Jt Fav 3 Long Island Sound (R L Moore) 9-2 9 ran Also: 4-1 Jt Fav Abdon, 12-1 Steel of Madrid 4th CSF: 27.75 Tricast: 107.35 They’re away and running with Race Day, Prize Money and Hawkbill making the early running ... Abdon is at the back of the field ... Race Day, from Prize Money and Hawkbill, followed by Royal Artillery and Steel of Madrid, they’ve less than four furlongs to go. Prize Money pegs back Race Day ... it’s Prize Money and Hawkbill ... Hawkbill edges clear and wins by a length from Prize Money in a Godolphin one-two. Hawkbill wins the Tercentenary under William Buick. One mile-and-a-quarter is the trip here with £51,039 the purse for the winning connections. Abdon and PRize Money are current 4-1 co-favourites, with Blue De Vega a 9-2 shot. Kieren Fallon rides that one in his first appearance at Royal Ascot in two years. Abdon 7-2 Prize Money 9-2 Blue De Vega 5-1 Long Island Sound 5-1 Hawkbill 6-1 Mulk 11-1 Steel of Madrid 11-1 Royal Artillery 12-1 Race Day 33-1 Tercentenary Stakes betting Prince Of Lir gave Luke Morris a first Royal Ascot victory in the Norfolk Stakes. Winner of his only start at Beverley prior to this race, trainer Robert Cowell had voiced concerns about his ability to handle the soft ground. In beating Mark Johnston’s The Last Lion, the Brocklesby winner from Doncaster, he confirmed the form from their previous meeting 19 days ago in the Brian Yeardley Trophy in winning by half a length. The favourite Global Applause appeared to have everything covered at halfway, but Frankie Dettori chose to go to the previously-favoured far side whereas the race unfolded in the centre of the track. The Last Lion briefly went clear but Silver Line and Peace Envoy came with a chance, only to be put in their place by the 8-1 winner. It was a third Royal Ascot win for Cowell, who had won two runnings of the King’s Stand through Prohibit and Goldream. “It’s a great buzz,” said Morris. “It’s what you work hard for. He’s only had one run and he’s just a bit inexperienced but he’s a very talented horse. He put the race to bed nicely.” Cowell added: “He’s a pocket rocket. He’s not very big but he’s very well formed and mature. He’s shown a lovely attitude. I’m delighted for the Swanns and family because they paid a lot of money for him and he’s repaid their faith.” PA Sport. Kieren Fallon has a live chance of Royal Ascot glory at the age of 51, having got the leg-up on Blue De Vega. This Irish raider was a fair third in the Irish Guineas, four lengths behind Galileo Gold who won a Group One here on Tuesday, and the extra quarter-mile here should help. Abdon comes from the Sir Michael Stoute yard and may be able to improve on his reappearance second, just the second start of his career, when he would have preferred a stronger pace. Godolphin’s Prize Money was also outpaced at the end of a slow-run race last time and can do better. He’s bred to be better on this wetter surface. In the same ownership, Hawkbill is on a winning run of four and beat Abdon last time but could do with drying conditions. Prince of Lir and Luke Morris got in front inside the final furlong and held on to win by half-a-length from The Last Lion and Silver Line for trainer Robert Cowell. 1 Prince Of Lir (L Morris) 8-1 2 The Last Lion (J Fanning) 20-1 3 Silver Line (James Doyle) 7-2 11 ran Also: 3-1 Fav Global Applause, 9-2 Peace Envoy 4th CSF: 161.51 Tricast: 534.21 They’re off and running the Norfolk Stakes, with Silver Line having made it’s way down to the start wearing earplugs to drown out the din before racing. Global Applause was last in, with big Time Baby and Plata O Plomo making the early running as the gates open. Plata O Plomo continues to make the running, with six or seven lined across the track ... Prince Of Lir takes the lead and holds on for the win under Luke Morris.

England and Wales are going toe-to-toe at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis in Lens in their Euro 2016 group game. You can follow the action here. Day Three kicks off with another of those two-year-old sprints, this one over the minimum distance of five furlongs and rated a Group Two. Global Applause has the best form, especially since Mehmas, the horse he beat at Sandown last month, ran second this week to the excellent Caravaggio. But will Global Applause like this ground? I’m guessing not, unless it dries up dramatically. Wesley Ward sends another of his speedsters and Red Lodge demands respect in light of what her stablemate did in the Queen Mary yesterday. Silver Line, representing Godolphin, won a small race easily at Nottingham. My preference is for Legendary Lunch, who clung on to win a Listed race at Epsom a fortnight ago and will be better back over this shorter trip. Reflecting on his win in yesterday’s Queen Mary Stakes, he says: “Lady Aurelia - I never rode a winner like it at Royal Ascot,” he says. “To quicken off like that, I could not believe it. When Wesley Ward brings horses like that over here ... look, I didn’t have to do much, really, just keep her in a straight line. To be able to enjoy the last 100m like that was just amazing.” On his chances today: “The first one [Global Applause] is probably my best ride,” he says. “The rest of them aren’t drawn so well but Ascot’s been very lucky for me so let’s hope the ‘lucky’ carries on.” The ground remains soft ahead of the third day of the Royal meeting after a dry night. Ascot clerk of the course Chris Stickels told the Racing Post: ““It’s still soft. I’ve had a walk of the whole track this morning and it feels much as it was. We’ve got quite a few races on the round course today and so we’ve opened up some fresh ground between the 1m4f start and the 1m2f start.” Warning: may contain the phrase “... even if lesser folks than royalty use the internal combustion engine”. 5.35: No9 Southdown Lad A mile and a half handicap for three-year-olds, this race features one of the oddities of this Royal meeting: a horse owned by The Queen who has been named after a terrorist plotter. Guy Fawkes (a son of Big Bad Bob) ran a really pleasing trial at Redcar but might not want any further rainfall today. Godolphin, Charlie Appleby and William Buick were the team that bagged this prize last year and they have the favourite this time, Lovell, who got going too late on his reappearance and could only get second but has scope to do better over this extra distance and looks well handicapped.

Primitivo, the winner of his last three, is much more experienced, getting better each time and versatile as to ground.

Another damp day under a threatening sky is in prospect at Royal Ascot, but headline writers won’t care about the mud if Order of St George, the even-money favourite, can take this afternoon’s Gold Cup, which is being run in honour of the Queen’s 90th birthday. And while at least some heads will be turned towards screens showing coverage of England’s match with Wales as the royal procession makes its way past the stands, the action in Lens will be done and dusted by the time the big race goes off at 4.20. It promises to be a suitably grand spectacle, with a full field of 18 due to go to post and a host of possible winners waiting to pounce if Order Of St George runs below form. If he is anywhere close to his performance in last season’s Irish St Leger, however, this is likely to be one-horse race. Order Of St George crossed the line 11 lengths ahead of Agent Murphy on good-to-soft ground, and while A Shin Hikari’s flop in yesterday’s Prince of Wales’s Stakes was another reminder that wide-margin victories should rarely be taken at face value, Order Of St George also stopped the clock in a very fast time under the conditions. Ryan Moore has ridden just a single winner so far this week, but Order Of St George will take some stopping and while Frankie Dettori, the new odds-on favourite to be the week’s leading rider, has some good opportunities today to add to his three victories to date, it is possible that the market has over-reacted in making the Italian a 4-6 chance. Moore, the 1-3 favourite at the start of the week, can now be backed at 2-1 with more than half of the meeting still to run, and his other rides today include Even Song and Out And About, the joint-favourite and favourite respectively for the Ribblesdale and the Britannia Handicap. Dettori is aboard Architecture, the other joint-favourite for the Ribblesdale, but Hugo Palmer’s filly needs to have recovered quickly after her second place in the Oaks less than a fortnight ago. He also has a solid favourite’s chance on Global Applause in the opening Norfolk Stakes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2014/jun/17/new-world-order-cameron-red-carpet-li-keqiang","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-17T19:14:45Z","webTitle":"In the new world order there are no more pandas for Cameron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/new-world-order-cameron-red-carpet-li-keqiang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jun/17/new-world-order-cameron-red-carpet-li-keqiang","fields":{"headline":"In the new world order there are no more pandas for Cameron","bodyText":"The double doors opened and in walked the most important man in Britain. Quickly followed by David Cameron. £14bn might be loose change to China, but it's a massive trade deal for Britain, and the prime minister had gone out of his way to give Chinese premier Li Keqiang the red carpet treatment. First he'd hastily fixed up a last minute cup of tea with the Queen – \"Do you want the Civil List or not, ma'am?\" – then he'd fast-tracked visas for Chinese millionaires. As the coup de grâce he had wheeled out several members of the cabinet for the signing ceremony in the Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen designed Grand Locarno ballroom in the Foreign Office. Li was clearly having a great time. He was relaxed and jokey, everything a Chinese leader is not meant to be. It was Cameron who was feeling the strain: spending a couple of days as tour guide and valet doesn't come naturally to him. He tried to summon one last smile. \"When Premier Li was first here four years ago, he gave my daughter Florence a toy panda,\" he said. \"Now she has grown and the relationship between our countries has grown.\" You won't hear a more blatant appeal than that. Gimme some pandas. Now. Three if poss, so that we've got one more than the Scots if they vote for independence. No pandas were forthcoming, so Cameron tried another tack. \"It is 30 years since we signed a declaration to hand over Hong Kong,\" he said. It is also 25 years since Tiananmen Square but he stopped short of announcing an issue of new stamps to commemorate that. Li responded graciously, as one might expect of a colonial governor bestowing largesse on his new dependency. He had much enjoyed meeting the Queen, he said, and was looking forward to \"creating huge energy\". Presumably a reference to the deal that the French-owned Hinkley Point nuclear power station was to be financed with Chinese money. Cameron was still just about holding his own until BBC correspondent Carrie Gracie asked Li a question about Chinese human rights abuses in Mandarin. At this point, the simultaneous headphone translation failed. Li was unbothered as he delivered a lengthy reply, but Cameron started to look around anxiously, before narrowing his eyes in a manner that suggested if he concentrated very hard he might just become spontaneously fluent in Chinese. Thereafter, there were long delays as the translators took centre stage. Despite speaking at breakneck speed, the Chinese translations of Cameron's remarks took far longer than the original English. \"I'm sorry everyone,\" the translator might have been saying, \"but this bloke keeps going on about the EU and other stuff we don't care about. Don't worry, though, hopefully the sales and marketing team from Burberry will be here soon.\" From then on the Chinese premier was on a roll. Which is more important to China? he was asked. France, Germany or the UK? To be honest, was the gist of his reply, you're all basically no more than local provinces to us. So why had China said Germany was more important last week, and the UK this? \"When you're in a local place, you sing local songs,\" he said. Or, in the immortal words of Midge Ure, \"you mean nothing to me\". As the conference wound up Cameron scowled while Li smiled and waved to the press.

Last week, Total announced it was taking a 40% share in shale gas exploration and drilling in the East Midlands. \"We clearly need a moratorium at the European level against fracking. If needed, I will come to be in front of the police in Britain. I fought against Total, I know them. They tried to frack in France but we defeated them. I am happy to resume the battle here,\" said the pipe-smoking sheep farmer who has twice been imprisoned following campaigns against GM food and McDonald's in France. Bove, who on Sunday visted the oil drilling site near the west Sussex village of Balcombe, was talking in London with three other European Greens at a US primary-style hustings event ahead of elections in June. He accused David Cameron of helping far right parties and extremists across Europe by trying to limit migration. \"Cameron is the best agent for the far right in Europe. He is a disgrace. We listen to him saying he wants to limit the rights of Europeans to migrate. It's like saying Californians should be banned from New York. To say that immigrants are costing more ... is totally unacceptable. They come skilled. They pay their taxes. They feed into the economy.\" Bove warned that the EC plan for a free trade agreement with the US would only benefit corporations which will be allowed to sue any government which tries to restrict imports. \"It is hugely dangerous. It threatens entire economic sectors by opening borders to all imports. It will pit region against region, because of the invitations to tender that will be required in law. The rules say that companies will be able to take governments to court. It opens to legal challenge [bans] against GMOs, shale gas, chemicals, anything. These bilateral agreements are slicing up democracy in favour of corporations.\" Bove and the other European Green party candidates lambasted Britain for backing nuclear power, describing it as \"anti-democratic\". \"Nuclear energy does not go with our ideas of democracy or local energy production. There is no sense of ownership with nuclear. It's not clean and [uranium mining] is creating terrible landscapes,\" said German MEP Ska Keller, a former spokesperson of the Federation of Young European Greens. Italian MEP Monica Frassoni accused commentators who backed nuclear power as a way to reduce emissions of \"cheating\". Without naming anyone, she said: \"They limit the discussions only to emissions, they forget how much it costs to build and to decomission plants, they try to win the argument by cheating. The nuclear business is exactly the opposite of sustainable energy.\" \"Hinckley B [the planned new nuclear plant in Somerset] is crazy. The more renewable energy there is, the cheaper it becomes. But we must not give all the advantages of low price energy to industry and load all the costs on to people,\" said Rebecca Harms, co-chair of the Greens in the European parliament. \"Nuclear is a high-risk energy model. We are going through a process of change, phasing out nuclear and fossil fuels and phasing in alternatives. The transition is difficult but you can see in Germany that it is working,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/jun/18/city-of-london-china-currency-trading","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-18T13:52:00Z","webTitle":"City of London boosted by China currency trading move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/18/city-of-london-china-currency-trading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jun/18/city-of-london-china-currency-trading","fields":{"headline":"City of London boosted by China currency trading move","bodyText":"London will be the base for the first clearing bank outside Asia for the Chinese currency, supporting Britain's push to be the leading western centre for offshore renminbi trading. People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, has appointed China Construction Bank as the UK's first clearing bank for renminbi. China, the world's second-biggest economy, is promoting the use of its currency in international trade and is expected to further liberalise the renminbi in the next few years. London is competing with New York, Paris and other financial centres to be the top offshore renminbi centre outside Asia. London, which dominates world foreign exchange trading, is the biggest offshore centre for renminbi payments. Outside China and Hong Kong, two in three payments take place in London, the UK Treasury said. The announcement concludes months of talks and coincides with a trade visit to the UK by China's premier, Li Keqiang. His first trip to Britain since becoming prime minister is expected to lead to about £18bn of deals. BP said on Tuesday it had signed a long-term deal to supply liquefied natural gas worth about £12bn to China. Rolls-Royce has agreed to co-operate with two Chinese nuclear reactor suppliers, SNPTC and CGN, on civil nuclear power projects. The currency deal between the UK and China follows the Bank of England's agreement in March with PBC to make London a hub for Chinese currency dealing. The Treasury said appointing a renminbi clearing bank was the logical next step and would support the City's efforts to expand its renminbi activities. George Osborne, the chancellor, said: \"Connecting British firms and markets to China's extraordinary expansion is a key part of our economic plan, because it brings jobs and investment to our country. Since I launched our drive to become a hub for offshore renminbi trading, the market has grown and grown and now almost two thirds of all renminbi trading outside of Mainland China and Hong Kong take place in London. \"Chinese bonds are now issued in Britain, Chinese assets are being managed here and now the first Chinese clearing bank outside Asia is opening in London.\" Osborne tweeted that making the UK a hub for the renminbi \"has been a personal priority of mine\". The government has been keen to build links with China as part of its efforts to get British companies trading with fast-growing emerging markets. Relations have improved since David Cameron led a 100-strong business delegation to China late last year. Then, Chinese state media dismissed the UK as \"an old European country\" and criticised Britain's stance on Hong Kong and Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama. Osborne hosted Li and other senior Chinese policy makers at the first financial forum between the two countries. Osborne said: \"We need to export to fast growing economies like China, and attract more investment to our shores. To do that we need to make sure China's currency, as it emerges onto the world stage, is used and traded here as that will not only be good for China, but good for UK jobs and investment too.\" Other measures announced at the forum included a licence for HSBC to invest directly into Chinese markets and the approval of renminbi loan guarantees by the UK's export credit agency, which could lead to the first renminbi transaction supported by the agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/16/wrong-investments-for-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-16T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"Letters: The wrong investments for Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/16/wrong-investments-for-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/16/wrong-investments-for-britain","fields":{"headline":"The wrong investments for Britain","bodyText":"So, Ed Davey is welcoming major energy investments from \"Japan and South Korea\", these investments to be in nuclear power (Report, 14 October). In Japan, Tepco is struggling to contain the worst nuclear power accident since Chernobyl. But Chernobyl was an on-site disaster while the Daiichi plant is a combination of inadequate design plus a natural disaster, followed by a cover-up by the firm concerned. The natural disaster can of course happen again. They are about to start removing the 300kg fuel rods, 400 tonnes altogether. The rods are probably cracked, possibly already burnt, are bent, and have been resting in sea water for 2½years so will be partly rusted. Should one break, or bump against others, you could get the nuclear reaction starting up again. With no control rods present it couldn't be turned off. As to thyroid cancers, they mostly affect children but what will be affecting the struggling workers is genetic damage. This accident needs to be treated as an international disaster, with the Japanese government taking responsibility and other nuclear powers assisting. Further, no more nuclear power plants should be started anywhere in the world and that includes here, where already we have plants in insecure places, for instance our east coast, where global warming will be raising the sea levels. Anna Cheetham Leicester CND • One can term this government's investment strategy as \"begging\" (Chancellor opens doors to rich Chinese, 14 October). Instead of British government creating British investment on the basis of a sound long-term strategy, it relies on attracting foreign companies to a cheap-labour, highly deregulated economy – strict with the vulnerable at home, relaxed with the comfortable abroad.

TV images showed deserted streets strewn with fallen trees on the main Okinawan island as residents heeded warnings to stay away from the coast and low-lying areas being battered by gusts of up to 155mph (250km/h) , storm surges and waves of up to 14 metres (46ft) high. Hundreds of flights were cancelled and the US military, which has a strong presence on the main island, called off all outdoor exercises. As of early afternoon local time there were reports of a handful of minor injuries, most of them to people who had not stayed inside. Further north, a man was reported missing after being swept overboard from his fishing boat. \"When the wind is at its strongest, it's impossible to stand. You have to hold on to something,\" Kei Shima, an Okinawa resident in her 30s, told Reuters. \"The lights are fading in and out, like the house is haunted. The rain is getting stronger and falling sideways.\" Officials had said that Neoguri could be one of the most powerful storms to hit Japan for decades, although it has since been downgraded from its original super-typhoon status. \"There is a risk of unprecedentedly strong winds and torrential rains. Please refrain from non-essential outdoor activities,\" said Satoshi Ebihara, of the meteorological agency. The storm is moving slowly and weakening in intensity, but experts warned that its reduced speed could increase the potential for major damage to homes and infrastructure. The worst of the typhoon was not expected to reach the more populated parts of the Okinawa island chain until Tuesday evening, before moving north to Kyushu by Thursday and the main Japanese island of Honshu by the end of the week. Although the typhoon is forecast to lose more of its power as it travels over land, it could create potentially dangerous landslides and flooding. Several typhoons a year strike Japan, but they usually develop later in the summer or in early autumn. The threat of flooding is particularly acute at this time of year, just as Japan emerges from its annual rainy season. In Tokyo, Keiji Furuya, the state minister in charge of disaster management, pleaded with residents to exercise the \"utmost caution\". The government is keen to avoid a repeat of the loss of life last October, when a powerful typhoon slammed into Izu Oshima island, killing 35 people. Then, local authorities were criticised for being too slow to take precautions. There are no nuclear power plants on Okinawa, but Kyushu, which is expected to experience violent winds and torrential rain on Thursday, is home to two atomic facilities. There is another on nearby Shikoku island. Nuclear plant operators say they have well-rehearsed measures in place all year round, while the typhoon is expected to have largely blown itself out by the time it reaches the north-east of Japan, where the Fukushima Daiichi plant is located. All of the country's nuclear reactors remain closed as a result of the triple meltdown in Fukushima just over three years ago. Kadena air base, one of the biggest US military installations in the region, was on its highest level of storm alert, while the Brazilian firm Petrobas said it had suspended operations at its oil refinery in Okinawa. Japan's meteorological agency said Neoguri would maintain its strength as it moved north, and was expected to brush Tokyo on Friday. \"But it will be weaker by then, so that Tokyo can mainly expect a lot of rain, and maybe some gusts of wind,\" an agency official said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2015/feb/09/merkel-obama-white-house-ukraine-russia-summit","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-09T18:39:48Z","webTitle":"Obama calls for resolution in Iran nuclear talks: 'They need to make a decision' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/feb/09/merkel-obama-white-house-ukraine-russia-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2015/feb/09/merkel-obama-white-house-ukraine-russia-summit","fields":{"headline":"Obama calls for resolution in Iran nuclear talks: 'They need to make a decision' – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap up our live coverage of the Obama-Merkel news conference. The two leaders have adjourned to a scheduled working lunch with vice president Joe Biden. Here’s a summary of the news conference: The US president said that sending “lethal defensive weapons” to Ukrainians fighting Russia-backed separatists was an option but that further diplomacy, sanctions and other efforts to isolate Russia were more immediately under consideration. German chancellor Merkel warned that the Ukrainian cease-fire talks planned for Wednesday in Minsk were not guaranteed to work, but said “I myself would actually be not be able to live without having made this attempt.” Obama discouraged speculation about a further extension of the Iran nuclear talks, saying that the P5+1 had offered Iran a unified deal that would allow it nuclear power but not nuclear weapons. “They need to make a decision,” Obama said of Iran. Obama pushed back at pressure from Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and the US congress to step up sanctions on Iran before nuclear negotiations were completed. “What’s the rush?” Obama asked. Obama said he had “very real differences” with Netanyahu on Iran. Asked about Netanyahu’s planned address to Congress next month, Obama said it would be unusual for him to meet with any world leader right before they faced an election. Israeli parliamentary elections are scheduled for 17 March. Both leaders voiced strong support for a new US-EU free trade deal. Binyamin Netanyahu has reaffirmed his intention to address a joint session of the US Congress next month on the subject of Iranian nuclear talks, despite opposition in both Israel and the US. Read our report from Tel Aviv: At his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu made no mention of the tensions with Washington but insisted he would “do everything and will take any action to foil this bad and dangerous agreement that will place a heavy cloud over the future of the state of Israel and its security”. He also told a group of French-speaking Likud voters on Sunday night that he would go anywhere in the world where he was invited to speak about the Iranian threat, not just as an Israeli but as a leader of all Jews. According to a poll by Army Radio published on Monday, 47% of Israelis believe Netanyahu should cancel the speech, scheduled for 3 March, and 34% think he should go ahead with it. However, a majority of 63% say the speech doesn’t factor in to their decision on whether to vote for Netanyahu in elections due later next month. Read the full piece here. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s twitter account was active during Obama’s remarks about his planned upcoming address to Congress and the Iran nuclear negotiations: The Russian foreign ministry’s English-language news page has this brief description: Russian-Egyptian talks will be held on February 10, with plans to address prospects for further developing the full range of bilateral relations, as well as current international issues. Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker flags an interview with a Le Monde journalist on the situation in eastern Ukraine: That’s a wrap. Obama encouraged a long view on the conflict in Ukraine and patience on Iran: “what’s the rush”? Merkel cautioned that there are no guarantees in negotiations with Russia over Ukraine but that it is essential to make every effort to achieve a diplomatic solution. Obama agrees that there are no guarantees in the Ukraine negotiations. As for potential lethal aid falling into the wrong hands in Ukraine, the question to be answered, he says, is, “Is it more likely to be effective than not.” “The United States and Europe have not stood idly by. We have made enormous efforts, enormous investments... in trying to resolve this situation. The Ukrainian people can feel confident that we have stood by them.” Just because we have not got the outcome that we want, you can’t say the “pressure over time” does not make a difference. “We’re going to have to keep trying different things to see if we can get a better outcome,” he says. Merkel on Greece: There will be a EuroGroup meeting on Wednesday and “what counts is what Greece will put on the table.” The German policy is to keep Greece in the zone, she says. “I will wait for Greece to come with a sustainable proposal and then we will talk about this.” Merkel is asked what she thinks of these calls in the United States for delivering weapons for the Ukrainians. Obama is asked why he’s so sure that weapons sent to Ukraine would not get into hands of rebels. Merkel answers first. She says the world must “try again and again” for a diplomatic solution. Then she draws an ominous analogy to the Middle East conflict. “We owe it to the people to explore every avenue.” No one, she says, for example, “would have dreamt of German unity,” but here we are at the 25th anniversary. “We have no guarantee” for the Minsk talks, she says, but it’s necessary to try. I don’t want to be coy,” Obama says. He and Netanyahu have very real differences around the Iran sanctions. “It doesn’t make sense to sour negotiations a month or two before they’re to be completed,” he says. “What’s the rush?” he asks, unless you believe any agreement with Iran is a nonstarter. Earlier, Obama said Russia was playing a “constructive role.” “This is an area where they’ve actually served a constructive role. And China’s served a constructive role. There has been no cracks on the P5+1 side of the table.” Obama turns to Netanyahu’s planned joint address before US Congress in March. “I talk to him all the time... we have a practice of not meeting with leaders two weeks before their elections. As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks before an election, she would not have received an invitation to the White House, and I expect she wouldn’t have asked for one.” Obama says “The issues now are sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified, that we’re at a point now where, they need to make a decision.” Obama says the P5+1 is presenting a deal to Iran that allows them peaceful nuclear power but ensures that they aren’t pursuing a weapon. If in fact their claim is true, Obama says, that they don’t want a weapon, “they should be able to get to yes, but we don’t know if that is going to happen.” “I don’t see a further extension being useful” if they have not agreed to a basic framework deal, he says. A question on Iran nuclear negotiations, which call for a rough deal to be agreed to by the end of March and a detailed agreement by the end of June. Obama answers first. He said everybody knew “it would take some time to work through” complicated issues “and a trust deficit.” “The good news is that there have been very serious discussions. That time has been well spent.” Obama says that nobody wants Russia to fail but on the contrary the hope is for Russia to be stable and grow. “Unfortunately, Russia has made a decision that I think is bad for them strategically, bad for Europe and bad for the world,” Obama says. “We can’t simply try to talk them out of it. We have to show them that the world is unified in imposing a cost for this aggression.” Obama turns to the question of government surveillance: “There’s no doubt that the Snowden revelations damaged impressions of Germans with respect to the US government and our intelligence cooperation.” He says he has “systematically worked through” these issues to create transparency. “We’ve taken some unprecedented measures” in awarding due process to non-US citizens, he says. #factcheckplease Merkel replies to a question about US surveillance of her phone and other spying in Europe. It sounds like there are no hard feelings. “If we look at the sheer dimension of the terrorist threat, we are more than” happy to cooperate with the US intelligence gathering, she says. “The institutions of the USA have provided us, still continue to provide us with important information... and we also don’t want to do without this,” she says. Merkel says, “What’s important for me is that we stand very closely together. ... Nobody wishes more for a success than the two of us here who stand side by side. The goal is not just a cease-fire but a new set of rules for observing territorial integrity. Merkel said the Russian side had failed to join direct-contact meetings with the Ukrainian side in violation of the last Minsk deal. “I can very well understand the ukrainian side on the territory,.. that they want to see that elections actually take place. .. Putin has [agreed]. A question from the German press for Merkel: what is red line across which the Ukrainian army must be armed? And what can the Nobel laureate Obama do more to defuse this conflict? Ouch. Merkel says she and HOllande have decided to “make one further attempt” to secure a diplomatic agreement. She says there’s a chance of a cease-fire and to create conditions to stop civilian deaths. “I myself would actually be not be able to live without having made this attempt.” “There is anything but an assured success in this,” she says. But the effort must be made. She doesn’t sound too optimistic. First question: The US is discussing sending lethal weapons to Ukraine. Do you two disagree on this, or is this good cop / bad cop? Obama: “The possibility of lethal defensive weapons is one of those options.” “It’s not based on the idea that Ukraine could defeat the Russian army” but the aim would be to “bolster its defenses in the face of separatist aggression.” Obama says that Germany and the US have ‘emphasized that the prospect for a military solution to this problem has always been low. Russia obviously has an extraordinarily powerful military.” And given the lenght of the border with Ukraine and the history, the expectation that Ukraine “can fully rebuff a Russian army has always been unlikely.” He says the goal is to “ratchet up the costs” of territorial violations, and “Russia has paid a significant cost.” On Ukraine, Merkel says the “inviolability of territorial integrity” is a founding principle of Europe. If we give up this principle, the idea of a peaceful Europe crumbles, she says “Russia has violated the territorial integrity of two respects,” she says, in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Merkel says with the French president and in contact with the US she would continue to try to impress on Russia the need to observe territorial integrity. “We continue to pursue a diplomatic solution, although we have suffered a lot of setbacks.” “I do not see a military solution to this conflict, but we have to put all our efforts into a diplomatic solution.” On to security issues, Merkel notes it is the 25th anniversary of German reunification. “IT is well worth the effort to stand by one’s values for decades, to pursue those goals. Now we see ourselves confronted with a whole wealth of conflicts.” SHe says Germany will help train anti-Isis fighters and deliver weapons. On Iran, she says “we have entered a crucial phase on negotiations.” Merkel is speaking. She agrees with Obama that the conclusion of a free trade agreement would boost European growth. Germany will come out “forcefully” in favor of an EU-US trade deal, she says. She previews the G-7 summit agenda: Health issues, including the lessons of the Ebola epidemic. The international reply has to be quicker, she says. Obama moves on to the fight against the Islamic State fighters, saying Germany would help train counter-terror forces in Irbil and stop travel of foreign fighters through Europe and Turkey to Syria. “We agreed that sanctions on Russia need to remain fully in force until Russia complies,” Obama says. “We are making it clear again today that if Russia continues on its current course.. Russia’s isolation will only worsen, both politically and economically.” Obama does not mention arming Ukrainian forces. Two issues in particular dominated: Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and the international fight against Isil. “It’s clear that they’ve violated just about every commitment they made in the Misnk agreement,” Obama says. He says Russia has sent more arms, tanks and artillery into eastern Ukraine. Russian aggression has only reinforced” the unity of Europe and the US, Obama says. Obama says the lessons of history cannot “allow us to stand idle and have the borders of Europe be redrawn at the barrel of a gun.” Obama calls for progress on a new trans-Altantic trade partnership this year. He says he looks forward to hearing Merkel’s plans for Greece and promoting growth in Europe. He says over lunch the two will talk about climate change. This morning the pair discussed global security, he says. The countries will work together to train Afghan security forces. They will hold the Iran sanctions regime in place. Obama congratulates “Angela and Germany” on their fourth World Cup title. But the US team “continues to get better with each World Cup, so watch out.” There they are, on the CSPAN feed, if not yet on the White House feed above. Obama welcomes “my close friend and partner, Angela Merkel, back to the White House.” Two-minute warning before Obama and Merkel appear. Additional sanctions on Russia or Russian interests has been floated as an alternative or possible complement to arming Ukrainian forces. Such sanctions could further damage a Russian economy already struggling with low oil prices, which have fallen by about half in the last six months. The chart below, via the World Economic Forum, shows the top 15 countries that exported fuel in 2012: Michael McFaul is former US ambassador to Russia. He’s a professor now, as his Twitter feed might suggest: McFaul continues: Didn’t realists advocate arming Iraq to balance offshore Iran back in the 1980s? Or is my memory failing me? Not actually the dialogue. We’ve embedded a video player that will carry a live feed of the conference atop the blog. Should be about 10 minutes now. Here’s the photo op before the talks before the news conference before lunch: Pace the louder voices on the American side, McCain at the lead, Merkel has said the crisis in Ukraine will not be solved by military means, and that the peace agreement struck last September needs to be implemented. From our report at the weekend: Speaking at the Munich security conference on Saturday, the German chancellor said she wanted to secure peace in Europe with Russia and not against it. Germany has opposed aiding Ukrainian troops for fear of worsening the conflict, which has already cost more than 5,000 lives, but the idea has many supporters in Washington. “I cannot imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian army leads to President Putin being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily,” Merkel said. “I have to put it that bluntly.” Read the full piece here. The United States first stepped up its joint training with Nato forces in Poland and eastern Europe almost a year ago. That training continues. Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts (@robertsdan) measures the appetite within the Obama administration for arming Ukraine. The secretary of state has raised the prospect of “additional assistance” and the incoming secretary of defense has gone further: “[Vladimir Putin] is leaving the global community with no choice but to continue to either put more sanctions in place or to provide additional assistance to Ukraine,” US secretary of state John Kerry said in an interview aired on Sunday. “Hopefully he will come to a point where he realises the damage he is doing is not just to the global order, but he is doing enormous damage to Russia itself.” Incoming US defense secretary Ash Carter went further last week, telling lawmakers he “very much incline[s]” towards arming the Ukrainian government, and questioned whether the administration was “in fact doing enough” to deter Russia from attacking the US Baltic allies in Nato. Since weekend talks in Moscow failed to produce an immediate deal, Republican critics of Obama’s approach are also growing louder. Read the full piece here. Egypt says Russian President Vladimir Putin will arrive soon in Cairo for meetings with his Egyptian counterpart, the Associated Press reports. Putin was to meet with European and Ukrainian counterparts in Belarus on Wednesday to address the Ukraine crisis, if diplomats can confirm preliminary terms. Cairo has just announced that Putin will appear alongside Egyptian president Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Tuesday. Sissi’s office said in a statement that Putin will be accompanied by several high-level Russian officials and government ministers on the two-day visit. AP reports: It added that both leaders would attend a ceremony Tuesday where several agreements would be signed, although it did not elaborate on the nature of the agreements. Putin last visited Egypt in 2005, when long-term autocrat Hosni Mubarak was still in power. Mubarak was toppled in 2011. Sissi visited Russia last August to focus on boosting trade and military cooperation. Both countries have signaled their desire to expand ties. Following those talks, Putin said Russia started supplying weapons to Egypt, but gave no details. Hello and welcome to our live blog coverage of a joint news conference at the White House with German chancellor Angela Merkel and President Barack Obama. The two leaders are meeting in an attempt, most urgently, to form a united front against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Other areas of bilateral conversation are to include counter-terrorism, the Iran nuclear negotiations, climate change and Germany’s plans for hosting the G7 summit in June. The return of sustained fighting and humanitarian emergency in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks have reinvigorated fears that the conflict could turn into something much worse and stoked new talk in the west of arming the Ukrainian government against Russia-backed fighters. Merkel’s government, joined by France, is opposed to arming Ukrainian fighters. US leaders including Senator John McCain are pressuring the White House to let the arms flow. Russian president Vladimir Putin demanded on Monday that the Ukrainian government conduct direct talks with pro-Russia separatist rebels if there was to be any chance of agreeing a durable ceasefire. Today’s meeting at the White House falls in advance of what are meant to be high-stakes talks on Wednesday in Minsk, Belarus, among Merkel and the leaders of France, Russia and Ukraine. The news conference follows a morning meeting between Obama, Merkel and vice-president Joe Biden, and precedes a working lunch for the trio. Merkel and Obama are scheduled to appear before the cameras at 11.40am ET."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2014/feb/11/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-11T10:01:29Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/feb/11/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2014/feb/11/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A celsius to fahrenheit conversion (Global warming 'pause' caused by spike in speed of trade winds, confused a change in temperature with an actual temperature.

Non-essential staff are being told not to come to work, although this is described as a precautionary measure, and in a statement the site's operator said there was \"no risk to the general public or workforce\". It is unclear how long the plant will operate with reduced staffing but a few hundred workers are understood to be on the site. The statement from Sellafield Ltd stated: \"As a result of a conservative and prudent decision, the Sellafield site is operating normally but with reduced manning levels today. This follows the detection of elevated levels of radioactivity at one of the on-site radiation monitors at the north end of the site. Essential workers only are being asked to report for work. \"Levels of radioactivity detected are above naturally occurring radiation but well below that which would call for any actions to be taken by the workforce on or off the site. The site is at normal status and employees and operational plants are continuing to operate as investigations continue. All our facilities have positively confirmed there are no abnormal conditions and are operating normally. \"We have taken this decision to focus on investigation and avoid disruption on and off the site (such as traffic disruption in the west Cumbria region).\" \"If this had happened during the working day we would just allow people to go home as normal. There is no risk to the general public or workforce.\" The government's safety watchdog, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said: \"We are satisfied that Sellafield continues to take appropriate action in response to the enhanced activity levels. The levels are not increasing and we are satisfied that Sellafield is making progress with determining the source of the activity. We expect to have further information around midday.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) confirmed the elevated radioactivity but said they were \"well below levels of concern\". The plant was still operating and not offline, she said, but all non-essential staff had been asked to leave the site. Gary Smith, the national secretary for energy at the GMB union, said the majority of Sellafield's workforce had been told not to turn up for work on Friday morning. The site employs more than 10,000 people. The unusual radiation reading at the perimeter fence had been detected at 2am, he said. But his members at Sellafield told him that they were not aware of any problems at any of the 1,000 nuclear facilities on the site. \"There's a possibility that this is a faulty air sampler,\" he said. Gill Wood, the national secretary of another union that represents 5,000 Sellafield staff, Prospect, said: \"Non-essential staff have been advised to stay at home today while the relevant specialist team investigates. The company's decision to partially close some areas at the site is a precautionary and measured decision and a safety measure that is recognised worldwide.\" A local newspaper, News and Star, reported that around 8,000 workers were affected. A Decc spokeswoman was unable to confirm that figure. Richard Wakeford, professor of epidemiology at the University of Manchester, said that asking non-essential workers to stay home was \"a prudent precaution until the cause is known and the situation rectified\". He added: \"There are no operating nuclear reactors at Sellafield, so short-lived radionuclides such as iodine-131 are not present there to any significant extent – therefore no stable iodine tablets should be taken as there is no need. \"If long-lived radionuclides, such as caesium-137, are responsible, then it will be important to find out what they are so that their source can be identified.\" The local anti-nuclear group, Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment (Core), said Sellafield was putting out \"mixed messages\" about the radiation that were \"doing little to instil public confidence\". The group claimed that if there were elevated levels of radioactivity at the perimeter fence, there were probably high levels outside the site. \"The warning to non-essential staff to stay home is an action by the company well above and beyond normal action,\" said a spokesman, Martin Forwood. \"We understand that it may take some time for the company to track down the source of the raised activity but the sooner they [Sellafield] level with the public by providing a more coherent explanation of what's going on the better.\" The 50-strong group of Nuclear Free Local Authorities (NFLA) said it was \"extremely concerned\" about elevated levels of radioactivity at Sellafield. \"The decision to partially close the Sellafield site and reduce its normal operations for the day due to elevated levels of radioactivity has to be of concern for all worried about this ageing facility,\" said the NFLA chair, the Manchester councillor Mark Hackett. \"I visited Sellafield a few months ago and was personally concerned about how decrepit some of the oldest parts of the site looked some 25 years after my first visit. I urge a full and independent inquiry into the source of this radiation leak and, while I welcome initiating prompt emergency procedures on the site, this is another example of the ongoing danger of dealing with such sensitive and potentially harmful materials.\" The management at the plant has been criticised by parliament's public accounts committee (Pac) over the past year. In a report in February last year MPs said Nuclear Management Partners (NMP), which manages Sellafield, had failed to stem rising costs and delays in dealing with waste and the decommissioning of facilities. \"It is unclear how long it will take to deal with hazardous radioactive waste at Sellafield or how much it will cost the taxpayer. Of the 14 current major projects, 12 were behind schedule in the last year and five of those were over budget,\" Margaret Hodge, the Pac chair, said at the time. MPs on the committee said they suspected that the NDA, a public sector body established to oversee the safe dismantling of the UK's old nuclear power stations and deal with waste, did not have a tight enough rein on NMP – a consortium made up of Amec of Britain, Areva of France and the US firm URS – to properly control costs. The timing of the radioactivity warning may prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who is meeting the French president, François Hollande, to discuss joint efforts on nuclear power at a pub lunch in Oxfordshire. The UK and France signed an agreement in 2012 to work together on civil nuclear energy. The largely French state-owned EDF is building the Britain's first new nuclear power plant in decades at Hinkley Point in Somerset."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/feb/18/nuclear-weapons-its-high-time-for-australia-to-be-bold-and-call-for-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-17T22:15:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons: it's high time for Australia to be bold and call for a ban | David Donaldson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/nuclear-weapons-its-high-time-for-australia-to-be-bold-and-call-for-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/nuclear-weapons-its-high-time-for-australia-to-be-bold-and-call-for-ban","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear weapons: it's high time for Australia to be bold and call for a ban","bodyText":"All countries are happy to condemn nuclear weapons in principle – even those who are building more of them. For many this involves spouting a couple of throwaway lines about the evils of nukes while sitting on their hands. Judging by the evidence, Australia appears to be embracing this approach. As a result, Australia remains committed to a broken UN disarmament structure, refusing to support promising new initiatives. Last week saw the intergovernmental conference on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons take place in Mexico. This is the second meeting in what will hopefully become a mechanism for banning nuclear weapons under international law, modelled on previously successful frameworks to eliminate landmines and cluster munitions. Currently, nukes are the only weapon of mass destruction not banned under international law – biological weapons were outlawed in 1975 and chemical weapons in 1997. There is no way nuclear weapons can be used in line with the laws of war: they are designed to kill huge numbers of civilians indiscriminately and decimate infrastructure. Humanitarian organisations, including the Red Cross, agree that there can be no effective humanitarian response to a nuclear detonation. Instead of supporting the effort to rid the world of this scourge at the conference, our foreign minister opted to condemn it. Julie Bishop’s response was to prescribe more of the same. According to her, advocating banning nuclear weapons under international law “would divert attention from the sustained, practical steps needed for effective disarmament”. This is ridiculous. The reason around 151 states support an outright ban on nuclear weapons is that those “sustained, practical steps” have been happening so slowly as to be almost unnoticeable. The assertion that somehow advocating a ban on the deadliest weapons ever created would distract from real disarmament is spurious and misleading. If anything, an effective prohibition movement will spur states to actually commit to making those sustained, practical steps towards real disarmament, as occurred when the movements to ban landmines and cluster bombs gained pace. Today, 113 states have agreed to banning cluster munitions outright. Even those refusing to do so, such as our allies the United States, have been forced to limit their use. The ban treaty on landmines – the process upon which the movement to ban nukes is based – has reduced deaths and injuries from these weapons by 60% since it entered into force in 1997. Australia initially resisted that agreement, too. Bishop suggests that “we have seen progress”, citing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), signed almost half a century ago. As she points out, the Nuclear Weapons States – China, the US, the UK, France, and Russia – have formally committed under the NPT to disarmament. But this agreement is exceedingly weak: 50 years later, there are still 17,000 nukes in the arsenals of nine states. A report by Gareth Evans in December 2012 showed that, of the 27 relatively conservative nuclear weapons goals made during conferences in 2009 and 2010, only two had shown “significant progress”, and none were fully implemented. It’s not just the current government that is to blame – Labor was just as weak in practice, though they maintained a pro-disarmament façade in public. Kevin Rudd used a visit to Hiroshima to declare that “we must be committed to the ultimate objective of a nuclear weapons free world.” In 2012, Julia Gillard introduced a motion in the House of Representatives calling for “exploration of legal frameworks for the abolition of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of a nuclear weapons convention, as prospects for multilateral disarmament improve.” Yet behind the scenes, Australia’s diplomats under Labor actively worked against international efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons because they were worried that advocating disarmament may irritate our great and powerful friend, the United States. This is despite Labor’s “unequivocal commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons” and the commitment of several American allies to banning nuclear weapons. Last year, Australia refused to endorse an 80-nation statement on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons because it included a reference to a Red Cross resolution with which Australia disagrees – a decision criticised by both former prime minister Malcolm Fraser and former foreign minister Gareth Evans. In October, Australia made an intervention at the UN on nuclear weapons — which one well-known disarmament blog described as a “weasel” statement — seemingly in an effort to undermine the disarmament efforts of New Zealand. Australia’s resistance to banning nuclear weapons sits at odds with most of the world. Austria has announced it will be hosting a follow-up conference to Mexico, so it appears this process is gaining momentum towards a treaty. Australia should be there supporting it. • Disclosure: the author is a former intern of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Australia • Addendum: click here to read a response to this article from Peter Tesch, the first assistant secretary of DFAT’s International Security Division Correction: The article was amended on 19 February 2014, 09:00am.

While global attention has long since shifted elsewhere, the nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima is far from over. This is the nature of nuclear accidents: they leave a long-lasting radioactive legacy. One year on, the situation is not under control. The announcement by the Japanese government that the damaged reactors were in a state of \"cold shutdown\" was met with scepticism and anger from a concerned public – and with disbelief among nuclear experts. As the recent rise in temperature in Reactor 2 has shown, the Fukushima facility remains unstable and highly vulnerable to a new earthquake. Meanwhile, it has been estimated that \"cleaning up\" the disaster will take a hundreds-strong workforce decades to complete. Beyond the reactors themselves, and the arbitrary 20km exclusion zone, the surrounding area in Fukushima province and beyond will suffer from radioactive contamination for generations to come. To give a concrete example: the amount of radioactive caesium 137 (which has a half life of around 30 years) released during the Fukushima disaster was 168 times that released by the Hiroshima bomb. It has been estimated that excess deaths, due to radiation exposure in the region, could run into the thousands. Fukushima, like Chernobyl 25 years before it, has shown us that while the likelihood of a nuclear disaster occurring may be low, the potential impact is enormous. The inherent risk in the use of nuclear energy, as well as the related proliferation of nuclear technologies, can and does have disastrous consequences. The only certain way to eliminate this potentially devastating risk is to phase out nuclear power altogether. Some countries appear to have learnt this lesson. In Germany, the government changed course in the aftermath of Fukushima and decided to go ahead with a previously agreed phase out of nuclear power. Many scenarios now foresee Germany sourcing 100% of its power needs from renewables by 2030. Meanwhile Italian citizens voted against plans to go nuclear with a 90% majority. The same is not yet true in Japan. Although only three out of its 54 nuclear reactors are online and generating power, while the Japanese authorities conduct \"stress tests\", the government hopes to reopen almost all of these and prolong the working life of a number of its ageing reactors by to up to 60 years. The Japanese public have made their opposition clear however. Opinion polls consistently show a strong majority of the population is now against nuclear power. Local grassroots movements opposing nuclear power have been springing up across Japan. Mayors and governors in fear of losing their power tend to follow the majority of their citizens. The European level response has been to undertake stress tests on nuclear reactors across the union. However, these stress tests appear to be little more than a PR exercise to encourage public acceptance in order to allow the nuclear industry to continue with business as usual. The tests fail to assess the full risks of nuclear power, ignoring crucial factors such as fires, human failures, degradation of essential infrastructure or the impact of an airplane crash. In the UK, the government is determined to push ahead with the development of a new fleet of nuclear reactors, as the partnership announced by David Cameron and Nicholas Sarkozy shows. The orchestrated effort between coalition officials and the nuclear industry to create a pro-nuclear public information campaign in the days after Fukushima showed that not even a large-scale nuclear incident could halt ministers' obsession with new nuclear. Officials did not even wait for the results of the government's own safety review before rushing to assure the British people that a similar disaster is not possible in the UK. Now, the proposed electricity market reform is set to rig the energy market in favour of nuclear – with the introduction of a carbon price floor likely to result in huge windfall handouts of around £50m a year to existing nuclear generators. Despite persistent denials by ministers, this is clearly a subsidy by another name, making a mockery of the coalition pledge not to gift public money to this already established industry. The Energy Fair group is arguing that the cap on liabilities for nuclear accidents is technically a subsidy and therefore illegal under EU law – and is now taking the case to the European commission. Fukushima showed us that nuclear remains a high risk technology. But what is also clear is that nuclear fails to make the grade even in economic terms. As we have seen with the two new nuclear reactors under construction in Europe, the already prohibitive upfront constructions costs have been grossly underestimated. The EPR reactors under construction in Finland and France are both around 100% over budget, with the end date for construction being constantly postponed. The hidden costs of nuclear - such as waste disposal, insurance and decommissioning - are also huge, and it is the public that ends up footing the bill. Surely it makes more sense to invest billions of pounds in genuinely sustainable and low risk technologies? One year on from Fukushima, we should not wait for another disaster to finally convince us to give up on nuclear power. • Rebecca Harms and Dany Cohn-Bendit are co-presidents of the Greens/EFA group in the European parliament"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/sep/03/geckos-life-in-space-post-humans-interstellar","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-03T11:08:32Z","webTitle":"The geckos sent into orbit died, but don’t give up on life in space just yet | Martin Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/geckos-life-in-space-post-humans-interstellar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/03/geckos-life-in-space-post-humans-interstellar","fields":{"headline":"The geckos sent into orbit died, but don’t give up on life in space just yet","bodyText":"The space age began with the launch of the Soviet Sputnik in October 1957. A month later a dog, Laika, was launched into orbit but didn’t survive. And then in 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth. When Gagarin later came on a goodwill mission to Britain, he was mobbed by enthusiastic crowds. But Harold Macmillan, prime minister at the time, remarked that “there would have been twice the crowds if they’d sent the dog”. So it’s not surprising that the sad fate of five geckos makes news. They were propelled into space as part of a programme to understand how living things cope with zero gravity – as precursors, perhaps, of a new wave of humans venturing into space. But will humans really have a role in space? During this century, the entire solar system – planets, moons and asteroids – will be explored by flotillas of tiny robotic craft. Robotic techniques are advancing fast but the cost gap between manned and unmanned missions remains huge, so the need for people is diminishing. But many of us are nonetheless enthusiasts for manned missions; I hope that some people now living will walk on Mars – maybe not for practical goals, but as a magnificient adventure, and as a step towards the stars. Unless the Chinese plan a “space spectacular”, the future of manned spaceflight lies with privately funded adventurers prepared to participate in a cut-price programme far riskier than Nasa would countenance. Companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX will soon offer orbital flights. And there are plans for week-long trips around the far side of the moon – voyaging farther from Earth than anyone has been before (but avoiding the greater challenge of a moon landing and blast-off). A ticket has been sold (I’m told) for the second such flight but not the first. And Dennis Tito, an entrepreneur and former astronaut, may not be crazy in planning to send people to Mars and back – without landing. Then there’s another scheme that would allow you to land on Mars – but with no return ticket. (Musk himself says he wants to die on Mars, but not on impact.) By 2100, groups of pioneers may have established bases independent of the Earth – on Mars, or maybe on asteroids. They will use cyborg and genetic techniques to adapt to an alien environment, and diverge into new “post-human” species. Their presence would also ensure that advanced life would survive, even if the worst conceivable catastrophe befell our planet. But is there life out there already? Nobody expects much from our solar system, but things are much brighter when we enlarge our horizon to the realm of the stars. We know that most stars are orbited by retinues of planets; there are around a billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy, and we don’t yet know if any harbour life. This century we may learn whether biological evolution is unique to our Earth, or whether the entire cosmos teems with life – even with intelligence. Perhaps we will one day find ET. On the other hand, Earth’s intricate biosphere may be unique. That may disappoint those who search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti). But it would have its upside: it would entitle humans to be less cosmically modest. Our planet, though tiny, could be cosmically important. And the first interstellar voyagers from Earth could instigate a “greening” of the entire galaxy. The most crucial impediment to space travel stems from the intrinsic inefficiency of chemical fuel. So long as we depend on chemical fuels, interplanetary travel will remain a challenge. A space elevator would help; nuclear power could be transformative. If there were an abundance of fuel for mid-course corrections, then interplanetary navigation would be a doddle – indeed simpler than driving a car or ship, in that the destination is always in clear view. But even with nuclear fuel, the transit time to nearby stars far exceeds a human lifetime. Interstellar travel is therefore an enterprise for post-humans, evolved from our species not via natural selection but by design. They could be silicon-based, or they could be organic creatures who had won the battle with death, or perfected the techniques of hibernation or suspended animation. The first voyagers to the stars will be creatures whose life-cycle is matched to the voyage – the aeons involved in traversing the galaxy would not daunt near-immortal beings. We can’t predict what goals might drive post-humans. But the exploratory drive would surely be weaker if biospheres turned out to be rare. The first European explorers who ventured across the Pacific were going into the unknown to a far greater extent than any space-explorers would be (and facing more terrifying dangers). If precursor probes reveal wonders to explore, there will be a compelling motive – just as Captain Cook was motivated by the biodiversity and beauty of the Pacific islands. But if there is nothing but sterility out there – not even alien geckos – the task might be better left to the robotic fabricators."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/20/osborne-chinese-charm-offensive-ignorance","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-20T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"George Osborne in China – wide-eyed, innocent and deeply ignorant | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/20/osborne-chinese-charm-offensive-ignorance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/20/osborne-chinese-charm-offensive-ignorance","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne in China – wide-eyed, innocent and deeply ignorant","bodyText":"Britain must be an open trading nation, welcoming inward investment just as it seeks to invest in others. But prostituting one's security and economic interests to a country whose values, practices and interests are wholly at odds with one's own is not openness but recklessness. Last week, George Osborne was Bambi in Beijing – wide-eyed and innocent to the threats of the Chinese forest in which he was so ignorantly wandering. Together, the succession of deals – on banks, nuclear energy and hi-tech – represent such one-sided economic concessions and expose our own fundamental weaknesses that they are embarrassing to the point of humiliation. In each, Britain surrendered sovereignty and exposed itself to economic risks that were not worth the potential gain, especially for anybody with even an elementary understanding of contemporary China. They also showed how indefensible so much financial and industrial policy has been over the past 30 years. Britain has surrendered its capabilities in sector after sector in the name of liberalisation and privatisation, a strategic policy that Bambi is continuing with unquestioning enthusiasm. I wonder, as he prostrated himself before the Chinese, whether he asked himself why he – and Britain – had ended up kowtowing to such a degree. I doubt it. The most eye-catching deal was on nuclear power, with the agreement that the Chinese nuclear industry will be able to build and own nuclear power stations in Britain. Lady Thatcher boasted, when the electricity industry was privatised, that she was giving power back to the people. Thirty years later, we learn it's become a gift to the Chinese Communist party, offering its state-owned nuclear power companies price and profit-margin guarantees that privatisation and liberalisation, wholly unrealistically in such a long-term business, were supposed to have left behind for ever. This is a breathtaking step in an industry where the sensitivities over operating safety, technical efficiency and waste disposal are so acute. Fukushima, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are remembered around the world. Chinese state-owned companies are a byword, not least in China, for inefficiency, loss-making and politicisation of decision-making. The party has wrestled for a generation with the reality that these companies, designed by Mao to embody the communist dream of uniting economic and social obligations, abolishing worker exploitation and spearheading modernisation, are sclerotic economic duds. Of course the party should let go, but it does not operate the kind of market economy that Bambi thought he was admiring. This is a system of Leninist corporatism. The party sustains its monopoly of power by control of the economy; it owns what it considers strategically important and allows private companies to operate only because they submit to a board of communist officials. There are thus no sources of independent economic and political power. Crucially, the role of the state-owned enterprises is to offer employment, so heading off another potential challenge to party authority from social unrest. The job of the state-owned banks is to provide unconditional credit to the loss-making state-owned enterprises so they can avoid cumulative lay-offs that would otherwise run into tens of millions. Unsurprisingly, this politicised system is opaque and corrupt. The state-owned nuclear power companies are at its heart. Last week, Transparency International declared that China's companies were the least transparent of any it surveyed. The Chinese nuclear industry is a black box unpenetrated by independent Chinese scrutiny, let alone foreigners. But you can be certain that the regulatory processes and decision-making will be as politicised as everything else. This is China's strategic and military heartland, central to one-party control. British energy policy, post-privatisation, is a mess. Centrica, which owns British Gas, was EDF's partner in building nuclear power stations. It dropped out claiming that the probable financial returns were not high enough and too uncertain, preferring to spend £500m buying back its own shares to support their price and thus the bonuses of its directors, the kind of capitalism Bambi refuses to reform. British ownership structures and director remuneration should be reconstructed and reconstituted and Centrica offered a long-term energy policy framework in which to invest. But that would be the sort of interventionist \"socialism\" that Ed Miliband favours. So, instead, we ask the Chinese Communist party to build nuclear power stations for us. Nor will they be as diligent as EDF has been in ensuring as much work as possible is sourced in Britain: the open ambition is to win work for China. Only Bambi could end up in such a position. Compounding the error, he has decided to allow Chinese banks to trade in London through branches. Iceland's bankrupted banks operated in Britain through branches. Never again, we said. If a bank wants to function here, it must put its own capital behind its British operations. But desperate to win the City's right to trade in renminbi, Bambi wants to waive this obligation uniquely for Chinese banks. China's banking system is precarious; non-performing loans could be as high as $5trn, proportionally far in excess of pre-crisis Iceland. At least the British taxpayer will be able to underwrite their British operations when the system crashes, as it almost certainly will. Every executive from a hi-tech company visiting China is advised to travel with a new laptop, so extensive are the cyber attacks. But Bambi, oblivious to this reality, was busy promoting hi-tech collaboration, including with the space industry. Here, Britain's position is once again crass. Eurosceptic Bambi and his party refuse deeper collaboration with the EU on space, recoil before the overt mercantilism of the Americans and so think China offers a blank cheque book. Chinese hackers need no longer hack the nuclear, space and other industries for insights and codes they can use for military and commercial advantage. Bambi is offering them all on a plate. A Chinese schoolgirl told him and Thumper, aka Boris Johnson, that China would be concerned if so much of their country was being sold to foreigners. Thumper laughed it off.

In a briefing paper sent to clients and investors this week, the Zurich-based UBS bank argues that large-scale, centralised power stations will soon become extinct because they are too big and inflexible, and are “not relevant” for future electricity generation. Instead, the authors expect it to be cheaper and more efficient for households and businesses to generate their own energy to power their cars and to store any surplus energy in their own buildings even without subsidies. In language more closely associated with green NGOs, the bank with assets of more than $1.5tn says it expects a paradigm shift away from large-scale conventional power plants. “Power is no longer something that is exclusively produced by huge, centralised units owned by large utilities. By 2025, everybody will be able to produce and store power. And it will be green and cost competitive, ie, not more expensive or even cheaper than buying power from utilities,” say the authors, who urge their financial clients to “join the revolution.” “Solar is at the edge of being a competitive power generation technology. The biggest drawback has been its intermittency. This is where batteries and electric vehicles (EVs) come into play. Battery costs have declined rapidly, and we expect a further decline of more than 50% by 2020. By then, a mass [produced] electric vehicle will have almost the same price as a combustion engine car. But it will save up to €2,000 (£1,600) a year on fuel cost, hence, it will begin to pay off almost immediately without any meaningful upfront ‘investment’. This is why we expect a rapidly growing penetration with EVs, in particular in countries with high fossil fuel prices.” The expected 50% reduction in the cost of batteries by 2020 will not just spur electric car sales, but could also lead to exponential growth in demand for stationary batteries to store excess power in buildings, says UBS. “Battery storage should become financially attractive for family homes when combined with a solar system and an electric vehicle. As a consequence, we expect transformational changes in the utility and auto sectors,” it says. “By 2020 investing in a home solar system with a 20-year life span, plus some small-scale home battery technology and an electric car, will pay for itself in six to eight years for the average consumer in Germany, Italy, Spain, and much of the rest of Europe.” By 2025, falling battery and solar costs will make electric vehicles cheaper than conventional cars in most European markets. “As a conservative 2025 scenario, we think about 10% of new car registrations in Europe will be EVs. Households and businesses who invest in a combined electric car, solar array and battery storage should be able to pay the investment back within six to eight years,” UBS says. “In other words, based on a 20-year technical life of a solar system, a German buyer should receive 12 years of electricity for free.” But the bank does not expect power companies or the grid to disappear: UBS says they have a future if they develop smart grids which manage electricity demand more efficiently and provide decentralised back-up power generation. “Electric vehicles are the key catalyst for driving mass adoption of battery storage technologies, as autos will fast-track mass production, which will be significant in driving down costs. We see battery costs moving down from $360/kWh today to $200/kWh by 2020, and as low as $100/kWh within 10 years. We believe that by 2020, lithium battery pack cost will drop by more than 50%, compared to 2013. The UBS report follows similar analysis by other large financial institutions and energy experts who expect new solar and renewable technologies to drive rapid change in large scale utility companies. Earlier this year, Michael Liebreich, founder and CEO of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: “The fact is that wind and solar have joined a long list of clean energy technologies – geothermal power, waste-to-energy, solar hot water, hydropower, sugar-cane based ethanol, combined heat and power, and all sorts of energy efficiency – which can be fully competitive with fossil fuels in the right circumstances. “In most sunny parts of the world it is cheaper to generate power from photovoltaic modules on your roof than to buy it from your utility. The best newly built windfarms are selling power at the equivalent of 3p/kWh before subsidies, which neither gas, nor coal, nor nuclear power can match. LED lightbulbs can be bought for a few pounds, providing home-owners a quick and cheap way of cutting their utility bills. What is even more important is that the cost reductions that have led to this point are set to continue inexorably, far out into the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/mar/11/nuclear-reactor-operators-financially-liable-disasters","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-11T15:18:01Z","webTitle":"Nuclear reactor operators must be financially liable for disasters | Antony Froggatt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/11/nuclear-reactor-operators-financially-liable-disasters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/11/nuclear-reactor-operators-financially-liable-disasters","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear reactor operators must be financially liable for disasters","bodyText":"Two years ago today a huge tsunami devastated Japan, killing many thousands and causing one of the world's worst nuclear disasters. Japan's people will grieve for many years and they will be paying for the nuclear clean-up for many years. Yet, as negotiations over how much subsidy new nuclear power stations in the UK will get from energy customers, the financial liability of reactor operators for accidents remains tiny. Things were supposed to have changed following Chernobyl in 1986. The international nuclear community recognised its deficiencies and proposed reform of the governance structures in a number of areas, including international nuclear liability regimes. The definition of damage was to change, with the minimum amount utilities would have to pay in the event of an accident was to increase and the timescale in which those affected could claim damages was to lengthen. But 27 years after Chernobyl and two years after Fukushima, the proposed changes to the liability regimes are still to be adopted by the signatories of the international conventions. Consequently, in the UK, the current maximum that a nuclear operator is liable is still only £140m. The government is seeking to revise the maximum limit, but is waiting on the post-Chernobyl revisions to be adopted by other countries. If it is introduced, it will raised the operator's liability ultimately to £1bn. As of October 2012, approximately £9.4bn (1,335 bn yen) had been paid out in compensation as a result of the Fukushima accident and this is expected to double in the next year. At this stage the final cost can only be roughly estimated, but the utility company, Tepco, has suggested that cost for compensation and decontamination maybe in the order of £70bn (10 trillion yen). As can be seen in the case of Fukushima, the financial compensation already paid out is far higher than even the proposed higher limits for a utility in the UK and the amount the accident may ultimately cost is likely to be an order of magnitude larger. Therefore, in the event of a major accident, as in Japan, it is the state that must step in and foot the bill. The issue of third party liability and the financial responsibility of nuclear operators and suppliers is important not only because it should set in place adequate financial safeguards to guarantee compensation and pay for remediation work in the event of an accident, but also because it affects the types of investment being chosen by the power sector. Not having to be responsible for potential damages is a government or societal subsidy, because if the utilities and nuclear operators were required to set aside funding and/or take out additional insurance, to cover such eventualities, it would reflected in a higher price for nuclear electricity. Other power sources, such as renewables – and increasingly the fossil fuel sectors – are being required to internalise into their prices their environmental costs. Unless this is done across all sectors and across all forms of environmental damage, it will further distort investment decisions. It has been a strange couple of years for nuclear power in the EU, with some countries firmly turning away from nuclear power (such as Belgium, Germany and Italy) while others, such as the UK, have continued to plan and develop their nuclear power programmes. However, what is clear since Fukushima, and increasingly clear in the UK, is that the cost of new build has gone up significantly and the potential accident costs are not reflected in the price being paid for nuclear electricity. • Antony Froggatt has written about nuclear liability for Greenpeace International and is the co-author of The World Nuclear Industry Status Report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2015/mar/04/netia-jones-alice-in-wonderland-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-04T19:00:06Z","webTitle":"Netia Jones: punk it up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/04/netia-jones-alice-in-wonderland-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2015/mar/04/netia-jones-alice-in-wonderland-interview","fields":{"headline":"Netia Jones: punk it up","bodyText":"A rainy February evening at Los Angeles’ Walt Disney Concert Hall. The city’s great and good are in their finery, Gustavo Dudamel sits next to the orchestra’s chief executive Deborah Borda. The 2,265-seat hall is sold out for the first night of a new production of Unsuk Chin’s Alice in Wonderland, in a multimedia staging by Netia Jones. The stage is painted in black-and-white geometric patterns, and between the feet of her fellow string players a viola player crawls around. At the back of the stage, a figure in a red suit seems to be supporting the bottom edge of an enormous video screen that rests at an extreme angle. The chorus are dressed in suits, bowler hats and Harry Palmer-style 60s glasses or scarlet hunting jackets and riding hats.A hush descends, but then a final musician dashes on stage, pulling on his trousers as he scampers to his place among the brass. On the giant screen, the letters that had spelt out Alice in Wonderland gradually drop away and lie in a messy pile, leaving only an eye peeping out, blinking through what was the “O” of Wonderland. At the back of the stalls, behind severe glasses and several laptops, sits Netia Jones, orchestrating and conducting the apparent chaos. There can’t be many opera directors who play such a crucial part in each and every performance, but for Jones it’s the only way her productions can come to life. “With this kind of integrated video, there’s no time for cues – I have to respond live to the music,” she says. Every key operates a different function: she plays the laptop as if it is an extra member of the orchestra. “Where projection doesn’t quite work in classical music is where it’s not totally integrated. Unless it’s completely enmeshed, it can be a fight.” But does she not have a flunky who can sit at the laptop each night? “That’s a big ask for someone else. I programmed the show myself, and I know the score intimately. Plus, they’d need to be as nerdy as me.” Nerdiness is crucial. “To get on top of the technologies, you have to dedicate so many hours of your life that I think a sensible person would just stop and do something else instead. There’s something about my neurotic weirdness that means I can spend 18 hours on a computer and be totally happy. I know that isn’t the greatest admission,” she smiles. She might be a self-proclaimed geek, but it’s a means to an end. “I don’t think technology is all that interesting. Humans are. Tech is a fun tool to play with in performance.” Fun and a shrewd sense of wit pervade all she does, and in person she’s warmer and more smiley than the image she presents of herself. Every stage of the video design is done by Jones herself, who also designs the set and costumes (the latter being “the most fun bit of any job by a country mile”). She likens the process to painting. “You have to envisage something and then make it happen. It’s the opposite to a film. It’s never that there’s a storyboard, and I can send that off and ask someone to make it for me. It happens in the making of it, and it has to be me that does it.” The projections that animate her productions are more than simply a few photographs, videos or text stuck on a screen. Images, letters, figures, faces and shapes appear, disappear, bend, writhe and throb. The white rabbit scuttles across the stage anxiously checking his fob watch, only to reappear on the screen treading the same hasty path. As Alice shrinks, the doors and windows on the backdrop grow huge, dwarfing the singer in front. As she opens out like a telescope, singer Rachele Gilmore disappears behind the screen and a projection of her body stretches to fill its entire height, then, in one of the production’s best visual jokes, Gilmore’s real head pops out to rest on the very top of the elongated video projection, its animated fingers gently twitching. While studying modern languages at Oxford Jones immersed herself in music and theatre and began using visuals in a lo-tech way – she was always interested in projection. “Back then, it might have been slide projectors or some kind of lo-tech video projector with a DVD player – whatever I could get my hands on! Shortly after graduating, the wonders of computer technology really evolved. The late 90s and early 2000s was a brilliant time for this kind of technology,” she says. Growing up in London, her mother, an art teacher and designer, stimulated her visual awareness from early on, and music, too, was always part of the mix; she learned the violin from age three. “If music is central to your life from a very early age, it stays there. I’m also supremely grateful as it’s meant I’m not scared of music or musicians – or orchestras.” Some of Jones’s earliest professional productions were baroque operas, working with Christian Curnyn’s Early Opera Company. Her work was hailed as “funny, neat and understated”, “fresh and fascinating”. A 2010 production for Aldeburgh festival animating Britten’s songs and Auden poems was “brilliant and very funny”; the following year, another Aldeburgh commission, a musical and visual celebration of Sizewell nuclear power station that took place at – and was projected on to – the building itself was “a cultural experience that worked on so many levels… [making] what normally goes on in concert halls, theatres and galleries look tame and prehistoric,” wrote Richard Morrison in the Times. Morrison suggested that Jones’s pioneering approach, unifying music, spectacle and drama in a single vision, realises Wagner’s dreams of the Gesamtkunstwerk – the total artwork. Is it a comparison that pleases her? “I’m not the greatest fan of Wagner,” she says, “but I love the idea of a whole artwork – that’s absolutely my intention in every piece, and it’s what I believe in the most.” The music she chooses to work with is invariably either baroque and early music, or 20th- and 21st-century works (recent composers whose music she’s explored include Knussen, Ligeti, Haas and Kurtag. “The baroque era was one of explosive exploration and technology and invention in every aspect but particularly theatre, and this is music that responds well to my kind of approach – there’s a space for it. There’s an interpretative gap where you can be playful and reimagine and revisualise. And that’s the same with 20th-century and contemporary music, which is extremely experimental and of course comes from an era of explosive technical invention.” She took “less than 10 seconds” to agree to create a production for Unsuk Chin’s 2007 opera: “I love her music and Alice in Wonderland is a total gift.” The South Korean composer’s intricate, playful and jewel-like compositions are a perfect match for Carroll’s multi-layered text full of wordplay and puzzles and its surreal cast who come and go with the (il)logic of a dream; both seem ideally suited to Jones’s innovative, multimedia approach. A less imaginative director might have been hampered by the strong visual references that have fixed Alice in Wonderland in our collective memories, from John Tenniel’s original illustrations, Walt Disney’s blonde innocent in a blue dress, to Tim Burton’s 2010 film and Helena Bonham-Carter’s scene-stealing, screeching Red Queen. “I spent a while looking at the Tenniel illustrations, thinking: ‘Could I punk them up a bit?’ They’re beautiful drawings but they’re quite restrained – not an adjective I would apply to this opera.” Then she came across Ralph Steadman’s late-60s set of illustrations for Carroll’s book. “They’re raucous and riotous and funny and iconoclastic – they were perfect”, and it is these that form the core of her visual design. The era from which they came, and Steadman’s other contemporaneous work, also proved inspirational. “The 1960s – and particularly Britain in that decade – is my overarching influence,” she says. “I think it’s about the puncturing of authority, the exploration of the grotesque and how monstrous but also inventive humans can be. There’s also the vigour and iconoclasm of the era’s pop art and pop culture.” Look out, too, for the occasional contemporary reference, not least a gangnam-style shimmying Bill the Lizard in yellow suit and shades. An oblique tribute to South Korea’s other very famous musician? “No,” she says, “it’s simply because I always thought Psy’s sidekick just looks so like a lizard in that video.” Of her work to date, the Sizewell project is a personal favourite. “There’s a very close relationship between Alice and that. There, I included Ligeti’s [with whom Unsuk Chin studied] Nonsense Madrigals, much of whose text comes from Lewis Carroll. Sizewell was built in 1961, so I was also celebrating that, and I quoted the Red Queen’s ‘Why, sometimes I’ve believed in as many as six impossible things before breakfast’.” It’s something of a personal mantra, I suspect. If a project seems overwhelmingly huge and ambitious, she’s up for it. “I love it when impossible projects are taken on. It makes us more human. It reaffirms life. There’s something about the optimism that’s very reassuring.” • Alice in Wonderland, production commissioned and produced by Los Angeles Philharmonic, in collaboration with the Barbican and LA Opera, is at the Barbican, London EC2 on 8 March, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

Fergus Ewing hit back after the UK energy secretary, Ed Davey, said independence for Scotland would force up energy bills for Scottish households. “England does require Scotland’s electricity to keep the lights on,” Ewing told the Guardian. He gave the go-ahead on Wednesday for the third largest offshore wind farm in the world, big enough to power 1m homes, as well as new financial support for floating wind turbines to exploit deep water sites. Ewing, a Scottish National Party minister, contrasted the 20% spare electricity margin in Scotland with the 2-5% margin in the UK as a whole. “The reality is that the supplies of electricity in the UK, especially down south, are parlously tight. There have been successive warnings by Ofgem, the regulator, and it is difficult to see the response to those warnings as anything other than a serial failure to come up with any coherent strategic response,” he said. “On a security of supply basis, England will require to receive imports of Scotland’s electricity for most of the time.” Davey said on Tuesday: “The size of the UK protects Scottish consumers from the full costs of Scottish power generation. In the UK, Scotland’s households pay less than they would in Scotland alone.” Scotland has 10% of the UK population but a third of its renewable energy and Davey argued that citizens of an independent Scotland would therefore have to pay more towards the subsidies that support wind and marine energy. He also warned that he would look to Ireland, Iceland and continental Europe for power if Scotland became independent after the referendum on 18 September, as well as boosting renewable energy in the rest of the UK. Ewing called the claims “political posturing” and said wind energy subsidies make up a “very small proportion” – currently 1.4% – of the costs on the average energy bill. “Over time bills would go down [in an independent Scotland] because we would have greater security of supply.” He also said an independent Scotland would not have to pay the large subsidies agreed by Davey for a new nuclear power station in Somerset, which he estimated at £35bn. Davey, an opponent of nuclear power before entering government, countered: “The Hinkley Point C price we agreed with EDF is at a much lower rate than the strike price for offshore wind.” Labour’s shadow energy minister in Westminster, Tom Greatrex, backed Davey. “There is no convincing explanation as to why consumers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should pay the support costs for renewable energy technology that would be in a foreign country. People who raise the question are accused of being negative and scaremongering, but it is a legitimate question.” The SNP leader, Alex Salmond, is committed to generating 100% of Scotland’s electricity from renewable energy by 2020. In 2013 it was 40%. The approval today for the 1.9GW offshore wind farm off the Caithness coast is a significant step towards that, according to Lindsay Leask, senior policy manager for trade group Scottish Renewables. “We are delighted to finally see the first ever consent being granted for a large scale commercial offshore wind farm in Scotland. This is a really important step forward for the industry, which has the potential to generate massive amounts of renewable power and support significant numbers of new jobs,” he said. While Scotland is the windiest country in Europe, England and Wales already have large offshore wind farms in place. In his interview with the Guardian, Ewing also criticised the new “dash for gas” backed by chancellor George Osborne. “From a geo-security point of view, it is increasingly evident that the UK has failed the UK citizens in not establishing a secure policy based, as far as possible, on indigenous supply,” he said. “Being vulnerable to gas supplies from Russia in the light of recent events is not the wisest policy.” Ewing declined to say whether revenues from future fracking and coal-bed methane production would be channeled into the sovereign wealth fund the SNP has pledged will receive oil and gas revenues in an independent Scotland. “We don’t think there is much likelihood of onshore hydraulic fracturing in the foreseeable future,” he said. He added: “Mrs Thatcher managed to spend like some kind of unconstrained serial lottery winner and managed to work her way through, with her successors, £300bn [of oil and gas revenues]. So like Iraq, we have an oil fund of zero. Norway has a fund of £500bn.” On onshore wind, which is as contentious in Scotland as in the rest of the UK, Ewing said a forthcoming map of “core wild areas” would stop development in some places. “It will offer a balanced measure of protection for our most precious areas, for example, no wind farms in national parks or national scenic areas.” Wind power developers have warned the map could create large “no go” areas and the Scottish parliament’s energy committee said on Tuesday that more clarity was needed on the map, particularly on how the 1.5-mile exclusion zone around communities would be implemented."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/earth-insight/2014/jun/04/mineral-resource-fossil-fuel-depletion-terraform-earth-collapse-civilisation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-04T12:26:46Z","webTitle":"Exhaustion of cheap mineral resources is terraforming Earth – scientific report | Nafeez Ahmed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/jun/04/mineral-resource-fossil-fuel-depletion-terraform-earth-collapse-civilisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/jun/04/mineral-resource-fossil-fuel-depletion-terraform-earth-collapse-civilisation","fields":{"headline":"Exhaustion of cheap mineral resources is terraforming Earth – scientific report","bodyText":"A new landmark scientific report drawing on the work of the world's leading mineral experts forecasts that industrial civilisation's extraction of critical minerals and fossil fuel resources is reaching the limits of economic feasibility, and could lead to a collapse of key infrastructures unless new ways to manage resources are implemented. The peer-reviewed study – the 33rd Report to the Club of Rome – is authored by Prof Ugo Bardi of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Florence, where he teaches physical chemistry. It includes specialist contributions from fifteen senior scientists and experts across the fields of geology, agriculture, energy, physics, economics, geography, transport, ecology, industrial ecology, and biology, among others. The Club of Rome is a Swiss-based global think tank founded in 1968 consisting of current and former heads of state, UN bureaucrats, government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists and business leaders. Its latest report, to be released on 12th June, conducts a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of mining, and argues that the increasing costs of mineral extraction due to pollution, waste, and depletion of low-cost sources will eventually make the present structure of industrial civilisation unsustainable. Much of the report's focus is on the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI), which measures the amount of energy needed to extract resources. While making clear that \"we are not running out of any mineral,\" the report finds that \"extraction is becoming more and more difficult as the easy ores are depleted. More energy is needed to maintain past production rates, and even more is needed to increase them.\" As a consequence, despite large quantities of remaining mineral reserves: \"The production of many mineral commodities appears to be on the verge of decline… we may be going through a century-long cycle that will lead to the disappearance of mining as we know it.\" The last decade has seen the world shift to more expensive and difficult to extract fossil fuel resources, in the form of unconventional forms of oil and gas, which have much lower levels of EROEI than conventional oil. Even with technological breakthroughs in fracking and associated drilling techniques, this trend is unlikely to reverse significantly. A former senior executive in Australia's oil, gas and coal industry, Ian Dunlop, describes in the report how fracking can rise production \"rapidly to a peak, but it then declines rapidly, too, often by 80 to 95 percent over the first three years.\" This means that often \"several thousand wells\" are needed for a single shale play to provide \"a return on investment.\" The average EROEI to run \"industrial society as we know it\" is about 8 to 10. Shale oil and gas, tar sands, and coal seam gas are all \"at, or below, that level if their full costs are accounted for… Thus fracking, in energy terms, will not provide a source on which to develop sustainable global society.\" The Club of Rome report also applies the EROEI analysis to extraction of coal and uranium. World coal production will peak by 2050 latest, and could peak as early as 2020. US coal production has already peaked, and future production will be determined largely by China. But rising domestic demand from the latter, and from India, could generate higher prices and shortages in the near future: \"Therefore, there is definitely no scope for substituting for oil and gas with coal.\" As for global uranium supplies, the report says that current uranium production from mines is already insufficient to fuel existing nuclear reactors, a gap being filled by recovery of uranium military stockpiles and old nuclear warheads. While the production gap could be closed at current levels of demand, a worldwide expansion of nuclear power would be unsustainable due to \"gigantic investments\" needed. Report contributor Michael Dittmar, a nuclear physicist at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, argues that despite large quantities of uranium in the Earth's crust, only a \"limited numbers of deposits\" are \"concentrated enough to be profitably mined.\" Mining less concentrated deposits would require \"far more energy than the mined uranium could ultimately produce.\" The rising costs of uranium mining, among other costs, has meant that nuclear power investment is tapering off. Proposals to extract uranium from seawater are currently \"useless\" because \"the energy needed to extract and process uranium from seawater would be about the same as the energy that could be obtained by the same uranium using the current nuclear technology.\" Therefore within this decade, the report forecasts an \"unavoidable\" production decline from existing uranium mines. US Geological Survey data analysed by the report shows that chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, platinum-palladium, copper, zinc, cadmium, titanium, and tin will face peak production followed by declines within this century. This is because declared reserves are often \"more hypothetical than measured\", meaning the \"assumption of mineral bonanzas… are far removed from reality.\" In particular, the report highlights the fate of copper, lithium, nickel and zinc. Physicist Prof Rui Namorado Rosa projects an \"imminent slowdown of copper availability\" in the report. Although production has grown exponentially, the grade of the minerals mined is steadily declining, lifting mining costs. 'Peak copper' is likely to hit by 2040, but could even occur within the next decade. Production of lithium production, presently used for batteries electric cars, would also be strained under a large-scale electrification of transport infrastructure and vehicles, according to contributor Emilia Suomalainen, an industrial ecologist of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Sustainable lithium production requires 80-100% recycling – currently this stands at less than 1%. Nickel and zinc, which are used to combat iron and steel corrosion and for electricity storage in batteries, also could face production peaks in just \"a few decades\" – though nickel might be extended some 80 years – according to engineer and metals specialist Philippe Bihoux: \"The easily exploited part of the reserves has been already removed, and so it will be increasingly difficult and expensive to invest in and exploit nickel and zinc mines.\" While substitution could help in many cases, it would also be costly and uncertain, requiring considerable investment. Perhaps the most alarming trend in mineral depletion concerns phosphorous, which is critical to fertilise soil and sustain agriculture. While phosphorous reserves are not running out, physical, energy and economic factors mean only a small percentage of it can be mined. Crop yield on 40 percent of the world's arable land is already limited by economical phosphorus availability. In the Club of Rome study, physicist Patrick Dery says that several major regions of rock phosphate production – such as the island of Nauru and the US, which is the world's second largest producer – are post-peak and now declining, with global phosphorous supplies potentially becoming insufficient to meet agricultural demand within 30-40 years. The problem can potentially be solved as phosphorous can be recycled. A parallel trend documented in the report by Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) agronomist Toufic El Asmar is an accelerating decline in land productivity due to industrial agricultural methods, which are degrading the soil by as much as 50% in some areas. Prof Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said that the report is \"an effective piece of work\" to assess the planet's mineral wealth \"within the framework of sustainability.\" Its findings offer a \"valuable basis for discussions on mineral policy.\" But the window for meaningful policy action is closing rapidly. \"The main alarm bell is the trend in the prices of mineral commodities,\" Prof Bardi told me. \"Prices have gone up by a factor 3-5 and have remained at these level for the past 5-6 years. They are not going to go down again, because they are caused by irreversible increases in production costs. These prices are already causing the decline of the less efficient economies (say, Italy, Greece, Spain, etc.).

Scorching temperatures and dry winds fanned at least five fast-moving blazes on Wednesday near San Diego just a day after firefighters contained two other fires in the region. The worst blaze burned 30 homes in Carlsbad, north of San Diego, and triggered 11,500 evacuation notices. A heat wave and tinder-dry brush had created a dynamic, dangerous situation, California fire captain Mike Mohler told local television reporters. “It's just unfortunately a recipe for a large fire and that’s what we’re seeing right now.” Television news footage showed homes reduced to smoking ruins as flames crackled through canyons, with smoke billowing so thick it blotted out the sun and motorists having to use headlights. \"At times it looks like there’s fire in the sky with the wind whipping back and forth,\" one witness, Ryan Marble, told the Los Angeles Times. A fire near the Camp Pendleton military base burnt out 700 acres (280 hectares), prompting evacuations of homes and parts of the San Onofre nuclear power plant. Ground crews backed by helicopters and air tankers contained two fires on Tuesday near San Diego and Santa Barbara, 250 miles north, but knew to expect more. \"Santa Ana winds, record heat and low humidity will persist in southern California through Thursday,\" said Jon Erdman, a meteorologist with weather.com. \"Beginning Friday winds will begin to turn onshore, with much cooler 60s and 70s returning to the coast this weekend.\" The fire in northern San Diego county flared on Tuesday morning near Rancho Bernado and by evening had burned 1,550 acres of canyons and ridges, threatening rural homes and triggering evacuation orders for 20,000 people, including several hundred within San Diego city limits. Local fire departments and the state department of forestry and fire protection cut fires lines and used fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters to douse the flames before they damaged property. San Diego's mayor, Kevin Faulconer, praised the “fantastic teamwork” of local fire departments and the state department of forestry and fire protection. \"Obviously the battle is not over.\" The cause of the fires was not immediately known but this week's heatwave combined with brush left tinder-dry by years of drought created ideal conditions for wildfires. The National Weather Service issued red-flag fire warnings and heat advisories for the region earlier in the week. Some forest roads were closed because of the danger. California, braced for a worsening drought and water shortages this summer, received potentially good news last week: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration increased the probability for El Niño conditions developing next winter to 78%, up from 66% last month and 36% last November. The El Niño weather phenomenon can produce wetter winters in California as warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean affect the jet stream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/21/hugh-muir-diary-ed-davey-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary: the past is a foreign country, especially for energy secretary Ed Davey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/21/hugh-muir-diary-ed-davey-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/21/hugh-muir-diary-ed-davey-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Diary: the past is a foreign country, especially for energy secretary Davey","bodyText":"• A big day for the government as energy secretary Ed Davey plights his troth to nuclear power. The coalition is excited. He's excited. But he once saw things very differently. There's that quote from him in 2006, launching the Lib Dem energy policy, when he said: \"A new generation of nuclear power stations will cost taxpayers and consumers tens of billions of pounds. In addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market ... People don't want nuclear.\" That seemed clear enough then, and it seemed clear enough today, when Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, found the page on Davey's website and flagged it up on Twitter. Ain't life full of surprises. Within the hour, the page had disappeared. • Yes, with the announcement that Hinkley Point, Somerset will house the first nuclear power station to be built in the UK for 20 years, the future seems bright. Still, the past is a bit murky. Today, leading the excitement as MC at the press conference unveiling the deal, Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, reached for the historical parallels. There is a proud legacy, he said, stretching all the way back to Calder Hall, the world's first \"commercial nuclear reactor\". Which reflects the official story but is not the whole story. For if one consults Calder Hall: The Story of Britain's First Atomic Power Station, published in 1956 by the government's Atomic Energy Research Establishment, one learns that the primary purpose for that installation was actually plutonium production for nuclear warheads. The electricity was a spin-off. \"Major plants built for military purposes such as Calder Hall are being used as prototypes for civil plants,\" wrote author Kenneth Jay. Is this their Year Zero? • A holiday atmosphere around the windy Docklands as ExCel gets ready for this year's World Travel Market. But there is also nervousness about no-shows, because although Barbara Cassani (Go Fly founder and leader of Britain's Olympic bid) is billed to reveal her recipes for success, commercial titans like Karren Brady have been paraded as star turns in the past – plans that did not materialise. Boris Johnson has already pleaded a prior engagement and delegates wait to see if Maria Miller, the culture secretary, will make the trip east. Sir Stuart Rose, formerly boss of Marks &amp; Spencer (and now Ocado), will be there, though, and one expects Taleb Rifai, secretary-general of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. His nomination of Robert Mugabe as African envoy of tourism earlier this year made him a bit of a target for demonstrators, so Rifai will be hoping for a quieter time among his peers. • A quick visit to pot-kettle corner, where we find PM Dave and Ed Miliband under heavy fire: vote Labour, get Ed; vote Tory, get Cameron – both prospects derided as \"gruesome\". This from Neil \"liar and a cheat\" Hamilton, firing up the Ukip faithful in Marlborough. He never was a great one for irony. • Meanwhile, another spasm from the paper that hates Britain. The Daily Mail, high on indignation, takes aim – with apparent justification – at Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski. He is alleged to have browbeaten a one-legged man in a wheelchair close to parliament, withholding any largesse and instead telling him to \"get a job\". So far, so Dickensian. We can all boo and hiss at that. But this is the Mail, so at the end of the report the attack comes from every direction. \"In July, he announced that he was bisexual and in a relationship with a man, two years after divorcing his wife Kate.\" These things are relevant in the land of bile and rage. • Finally, after his triumphant tour of China, Boris Johnson has never seemed more dangerous. Especially now that he has his own personal lightsaber, as wielded by Darth Vader and others in Star Wars. Registered as a gift from producer George Lucas. Just right for biffing PM Dave.

Will Chinese companies be subcontracted to construct the Hinkley Point C power station? If they are, there is a worrying safety precedent from the construction of China's first nuclear generating station, at Daya Bay, near Hong Kong, 20 years ago. On EDF's watch – the French company was responsible for the design and project management – the Chinese company used only 50% of the necessary reinforcement rods in the concrete base under the nuclear reactor. And would such construction companies be allowed to use manual workers from China? What will the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG) actually be doing at Hinkley Point? It is heavily involved in joint ventures with Areva (yet another state-owned company), the firm building the reactor. Will some of its construction be subcontracted to the Chinese group? Should we be worried by the fact that CGNPG website has no link to its policies on \"social responsibility\"? And do the government and its supporters realise that China has a Leninist state where the party envelops all state institutions, including its business corporations? Is it comfortable, therefore, that British taxpayers will now be subsidising the Chinese Communist party? Professor Jeffrey Henderson Director, Centre for East Asian Studies, University of Bristol • You are wrong to say \"a decision on which community would … host a deep high-level waste repository is as far away as ever after plans for the north-west were scotched by Cumbria county council\" (Britain enlists Chinese help to revive an outdated technology, 21 October). New nuclear enthusiast Ed Davey has finessed that democratic rejection. The invitation to host the waste repository is due to go out again next year but this time the decision is proposed to be at district council level, so Cumbria county council will not be in a position to say no. The government is perfectly aware the only community likely to invite the waste repository is Copeland, near Sellafield, regardless of the shattered geology but incredibly beautiful landscape of the Lake District. So the future of nuclear power in the UK is based upon an enormous commitment to the French and Chinese governments, while the health and safety of generations unborn and the huge potential damage done to Cumbria's non-nuclear industries for the foreseeable future, is in the hands of a few – largely Labour – councillors at Whitehaven. Note the much vaunted policy of community \"voluntarism\", said to be steering the nuclear waste decision, is only used where the answer is nearly sure to accord with government expediency. Not in the case of the HS2 route, for example. Robert Straughton Swarthmoor (SW Cumbria) Quakers • As negotiations over Hinkley Point C demonstrate, the backdrop of energy markets cannot be ignored. The focus of today's gas debates constantly veers between eye-watering price increases and (perhaps wishful thinking over) future shale-gas-induced abundance. The truth is that efforts to create a low-carbon economy raise multidimensional problems. These include the twin demands of legally mandated emissions reductions and investment certainty. In pricing subsidies, a degree of crystal ball gazing is unavoidable if nuclear is to have a significant role in finding solutions, especially in view of the costs of construction and decommissioning. But whatever deal is cut, our political leaders will have to satisfy civil society that nuclear risk can be managed acceptably – and before this can happen problems of long-term storage remain to be resolved. Professor Mark Stallworthy Swansea University • On the day the chancellor announced China's entry into the UK nuclear power market, the Environment Agency was considering where 1,400 job cuts should fall – another small but significant lack of joined-up thinking in government. The agency's effective regulation of the nuclear industry does not just rely on its nuclear specialists but also on ecologists, flood engineers, contaminated land and groundwater land experts, and others whose jobs are at risk. Further cuts will inevitably affect the agency's ability to regulate the design, construction and operation of new nuclear power stations. Kevin Warden Prospect West • Following months of negotiations behind closed doors, we have a deal that represents terrible value for money for billpayers. Given that EDF is only expected to meet a \"share\" of the costs of dealing with the toxic waste its reactors would create – and there is a cap on the amount it would have to pay – it's clear that the public will also pick up the bill for clean-up costs in future. Earlier this year, I joined other MPs in writing to the National Audit Office calling for a review of the negotiations between the government and EDF. Now that the details of the agreement are out in the open, I have written to the NAO requesting that it investigate. Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion • The answers to Britain's energy crisis do not simply lie in price freezes and nuclear energy. Across the country, people are setting up social enterprises and co-operatives to generate and supply their energy. Prices are kept at a rate that is best for their customers, not shareholders, and frequently profits are reinvested into green or renewable energy technologies. These overlooked energy markets must be supported if living standards in the UK are to be improved and energy poverty is to be rolled back. Peter Holbrook Chief executive, Social Enterprise UK • The government's contracts experts must have a lot of experience negotiating with those cleverclogs from commerce and industry. Just think of the watertight IT contracts for the NHS, PPI contracts for schools and hospitals, rail franchises and dealings with G4S.

The cost of the benchmark Brent blend slumped below $72 a barrel before rallying slightly but some industry experts – including the chief executive of Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer – have predicted that crude values will keep on going down, possibly as low as $60. If this were to happen it would mean that the price of oil had dived by nearly 50% in less than six months. If the price stayed at that level for any amount of time it would radically change the landscape for producers and consumers alike in the UK. Here are five potential consequences. Petrol and diesel prices The big four supermarkets sliced another 2p off the price of fuel on Friday in reaction to the crude slump. When the price of oil was $60 in December 2006, the price of petrol at the pumps reached 88.2p a litre and diesel 93.7p. This compares with a current average price – before the wave of 2p cuts on Friday – of 122.4p for petrol and 126.95p for diesel. Since then British motorists have seen increases in the fuel duty and VAT levied by the government. Unless the government cuts fuel duty and VAT, the cost of petrol and diesel might not fall to the levels seen on the forecourt eight years ago. The AA says there is usually a time lag between pump prices falling and motorists using their vehicles more, so families may choose to spend their savings on food rather than drive more. The commercial sector – road hauliers – would benefit from lower fuel costs, as would the airlines and the shipping industry. That should lead to lower consumer prices for food and even commodities such as steel, which require a lot of energy to make. Scotland’s oil economy and Treasury tax receipts The North Sea offshore oil industry tipped £6.5bn into the pockets of the taxman in 2012-13, and is an important driver of the Scottish economy, as the Scottish National party (SNP) made clear during the referendum on independence. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, argued that $24tn (£15tn) worth of oil and gas was still waiting to be extracted, but these figures were premised on a crude price of $100 a barrel. An oil price substantially below that would complicate the SNP’s costings for an independent Scotland, which would be looking to the North Sea for a sizeable contribution in tax and jobs. The offshore lobby group Oil &amp; Gas UK said that even before the recent fall in crude prices there had been a huge drop-off in exploration activity in the North Sea. The organisation has been lobbying George Osborne hard to reduce taxes in his autumn statement next week in a move to improve the situation. Mike Tholen, Oil &amp; Gas UK’s economics director, said on Friday that a prolonged period of $60 oil would be disastrous for investment and jobs. “Decommissioning [oil platforms] would become the biggest activity and that would be a crying shame. It would cost the Exchequer a fortune [in tax breaks] to take the stuff away and mean oil left in the ground.” Inflation Lower energy prices have helped to hold down UK inflation, which reached 1.3% in October on the CPI measure – just above its lowest level in five years. The Bank of England estimates that a $1 a barrel increase in oil adds 0.1% to inflation over a two-year period. But one of the reasons why energy prices are falling is that demand for the product is not as high as expected. That is in turn because the global economy, with the exception of the US, is not powering ahead. Lower oil prices and lower inflation should be a boost to economic growth, at least in those countries such as Britain, which are not dependent on producing commodities, as Russia or Venezuela are. So $60 oil would significantly cut inflation, giving comfort to the Bank of England which, like other central banks, worries about how to pitch interest rates when goods and service prices are rising. Expectations of lower inflation has made buying government debt less attractive and pushed 10-year yields on US Treasury bonds to five-week lows on Friday. Dominic Rossi, a director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: “The fall in oil prices will boost economic activity.” HSBC analysts said in a research note that corporate profits would be pushed up as a consequence and equity markets should benefit. Alternative energy A slump in the oil price to $60 should drive down the gas price, leading to lower household heating and lighting bills in Britain – so long as the Big Six energy suppliers passed on the gains. It would also lead to more gas-fired power stations being used to generate electricity, which would damage profits for nuclear power stations and windfarms. The gas price is not directly linked to the oil price in Britain, though it has broadly followed oil’s downward trajectory in the UK. Crude prices are down in Britain this year by about 33%, while wholesale gas has fallen in value by 17% and coal by 12%. The price of wholesale electricity in the UK is down 12% this year at £48.80 a megawatt hour (MWh). Peter Atherton, utility analyst at Liberum Capital, says a prolonged period of $60 oil could be expected to drive down electricity prices below £45 a MWh, which would cut profits for existing nuclear plants and be very painful for renewables. “It would destroy value on existing renewable energy projects and make it difficult to raise financing for future projects,” said Atherton. One project in particular would look like a bad deal for the taxpayer in a $60 world: the first nuclear reactor constructed in Britain for a quarter of a century. The government is backing a guaranteed payment of £96.90 a MWh for EDF’s new atomic plant at Hinkley in Somerset, which would look like an even worse deal for the UK if the oil price slumped further. Fracking Lower oil and gas prices could fatally undermine the government’s desire to see a shale industry take off in Britain. The rate of drilling in the US – the fracking pioneer – has fallen dramatically since the price of gas there plunged from $12 per million British thermal units (mmBTU) to $3. The value of gas in Britain currently is the equivalent of about $12 to $14 per mmBTU, and many experts believe it could cost UK shale drillers such as Cuadrilla Resources about $8 to $10 to extract. If $60 oil dragged down gas prices to $8, that could make it uneconomic to continue with UK fracking unless the industry came up with new ways to cut costs. It would also make imports of liquefied natural gas a potentially cheaper option. But no one really knows whether gas can be fracked in Britain economically because almost no wells have been drilled yet. The UK Onshore Operators Group says oil and gas firms are long-term thinkers and unlikely to be blown off course by short-term price fluctuations, certainly in the exploration phase. Ken Cronin, UKOOG’s chief executive, said: “There are also a number of reasons why the UK wants gas, including to displace coal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/may/22/wind-renewable-coal-simon-jenkins","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-22T20:00:04Z","webTitle":"You can't write off the contribution of wind energy | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/22/wind-renewable-coal-simon-jenkins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/may/22/wind-renewable-coal-simon-jenkins","fields":{"headline":"You can't write off the contribution of wind energy","bodyText":"As well as the coal miners killed in disasters, Simon Jenkins (A dash for renewables won't rid us of the horrors of coal, 16 May) could have added their occupational illnesses, as well as the diseases suffered by everyone as a result of breathing air polluted by burning coal. The great London smog of December 1952 killed more than 15,000 people. Electricity has a high political profile but only represents about 12% of end user power consumption, and unlike other fuels, electricity cannot be stored, so generation and consumption must be simultaneous. As peak electricity use only occurs for about 20% of the day, there are idle generators for more than 80% of the time. The biggest UK energy problem is not supply but waste. By 2026 100% of German houses will be zero energy consumers. In the UK it will be under 5%. Thirty years ago more than 60% of electricity was coal-fired; today the figure is 38%. Electricity generation wastes nearly 60% of input energy. Other EU countries have combined heat and power stations that are 70% efficient. The most wasteful sector is transport at nearly 80%, and 99% dependent on oil. Indeed, more than 80% of all UK oil is now used for transport, as other oil uses have been replaced mostly by gas. There is as yet no economic alternative to oil for transport, but there needs to be: toxic transport fumes kill about 29,000 people a year, and all UK cities breach both the WHO and EU air standards. Professor LJS Lesley Liverpool • Simon Jenkins states that \"wind generated electricity … but not much\". The Department of Energy and Climate Change published statistics in March showing that renewable energy provided a record 15% of the UK's electricity in 2013, leading to a 3% drop in the UK's use of coal and a 1% drop in use of gas. For the last quarter of 2013 the figures are even better, with renewables generating an all-time high of 18% of the UK's electricity. That meant that the amount of coal being used to generate electricity was 7% lower in the third quarter of 2013 than a year earlier, with the share taken by gas also falling to the lowest for at least 15 years. Jenkins is incorrect to state that \"wind power has driven up fuel poverty\". The increase in the price of gas over the last few years is the main cause of rising fuel bills. Last year, wind energy powered more than 6m homes, and helped lead to a decrease in use of fossil fuels. These are real achievements of which the UK should be proud. When it comes to taking practical action against climate change, wind energy is a key player. Jennifer Webber RenewableUK • Three cheers to Simon Jenkins for his reference to Wade Allison's book Radiation and Reason. If coal, oil, gas, etc operated to the equivalent safety level of nuclear power, they would be prohibitively expensive. To make further environmental progress, the government should back an immediate investment in a thorium nuclear plant – smaller, safer and can't be weaponised (which is why governments ignored it 60 years ago).

More than 2ft (60cm) of snow fell on central Connecticut and parts of Rhode Island, New Hampshire and south-east Massachusetts, with Boston due to get up to 3ft (90cm). New York City was due to get about 1ft (30cm) with more expected elsewhere in the state, while heavy snowfall was also predicted in Connecticut and Maine. Winds reached 35 to 40 miles per hour by Friday afternoon and forecasters expected gusts up to 60mph. The storm prompted the governors of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Maine to declare states of emergency in the face of the fearsome snowstorm. The Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, took the rare step of announcing a ban on most car travel starting on Friday afternoon, while the Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy, closed the state's main roads to all but emergency vehicles. Blizzard warnings were in place from New Jersey to southern Maine, including New York City and Boston. Commuters were repeatedly warned not to travel on Friday evening or Saturday, with the National Weather Service warning that visibility could be \"near zero in white-out conditions\". The National Weather Service said Boston could receive three feet (90cm) of snow, which would rank as the city's largest ever snowfall. The previous high of 27.6 inches was recorded in 2003. Cities from Hartford, Connecticut, to Portland, Maine, were expected to see at least a foot of snow, the NWS said, while New York City was predicted to see 12.1 inches. By Friday night some commuter trains between New York City and Westchester County, Long Island and Connecticut had already been suspended. Amtrak suspended rail services between New York, Boston and points north on Friday afternoon. About 3,500 flights were cancelled on Friday and hundreds more on Saturday. Most airlines had cancelled flights in and out of New York City and Boston as well as smaller airports in the region before the storm. The flight tracking website Flight Aware said over 3,100 flights had been cancelled on Friday and a further 1,000 on Saturday. Passengers were advised to check with their airline before travelling to the airport. The Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Plymouth, Massachusetts, lost power and automatically shut down on Friday. An official at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said: \"There was no impact on plant workers or the public.\" In many cases, authorities ordered non-essential government workers to stay at home, urged private employers to do the same, told people to prepare for power cuts and encouraged them to check on elderly or disabled neighbours. \"People need to take this storm seriously,\" said Malloy. \"Please stay home once the weather gets bad except in the case of real emergency.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was monitoring the storm and would hold \"regular operational briefings\" with state agencies in affected areas on Friday and Saturday. The storm wasn't bad news for everyone. The New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, suggested that people relax at home by cooking or watching a film. Bloomberg said he planned to catch up on his sleep. As she stocked up at a Brooklyn grocery store, 28-year-old Jackie Chevallier said that after two years without much snow, she was looking forward to waking up to a sea of white. \"I'd like to go sledding,\" she said. The storm also posed a risk of flooding at high tide to areas still recovering from last October's hurricane. \"Many of the same communities that were inundated by Hurricane Sandy's tidal surge just about 100 days ago are likely to see some moderate coastal flooding this evening,\" said Bloomberg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/08/un-roadmap-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-08T15:21:31Z","webTitle":"UN issued with roadmap on how to avoid climate catastrophe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/08/un-roadmap-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/08/un-roadmap-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"UN issued with roadmap on how to avoid climate catastrophe","bodyText":"The United Nations was presented with a roadmap to avoid a climate catastrophe on Tuesday, prescribing specific actions for the world’s biggest economies to keep warming below 2C. In a report prepared for the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, experts from 30 international institutions set out a range of strategies for the economies responsible for more than two-thirds of global emissions. The initiative is the first of its kind to try to make concrete plans around the various targets that have been discussed at the UN climate change negotiations over the last two decades, said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute, and a leader of the Pathways to Deep Decarbonisation Project. “All we have been doing in these negotiations for all these years is talking about things in the abstract. It’s not producing the deep technological changes that can get us to a low-carbon global economy,” he told the Guardian. The report, with its detailed data on electricity supply, transport and shipping, and building codes in each country, was aimed at remedying this by making the targets operational, he said. It is hoped the study will help to build momentum for a UN climate change summit in New York this September, and so advance the negotiations to reach a global climate deal by the end of 2015. The study looks at the world’s 15 biggest economies: America, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea, which between them account for 70% of global emissions. It rejects the idea that has taken hold since the failed Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 that warming of 4 or 5C is already inevitable. “We do not subscribe to the view held by some that the 2C limit is impossible to achieve and that it should be weakened or dropped altogether,” the report said, adding that the science about the 2C threshold was clear. “The political risks of jettisoning the 2C limit are also significant,” the report went on, and would further weakening the chances of any action. Instead, it was time for leaders to direct government officials and independent institutions to work on the technologies that would actually produce reductions in emissions. To date, the targets discussed at the UN climate talks were detached from reality, the report said. “By and large national targets are not derived from an assessment of what will be needed to stay within the 2C limit,” it said. Sachs said that was in part a function of the UN negotiations process, that left a highly technical discussion to diplomats. “It put the lawyers out front and left the technologists out of the room, and the result is that we have had 21 years of lawyering and no success in application of the international framework,” he said. The result, he said, were emissions reductions targets that were far too conservative to avoid 2C warming. “I didn’t hear President Obama say we have a 2C agreed global warming limit, and I am basing American policy on making sure that is successful. I have not heard any leader saying that,” he said. “Actually, now we have a report that will tell them what it would take.” Those options vary widely according to the country. The report envisages that Britain by mid-century would generate about 35% of its electricity from nuclear power plants and 40% from coal using carbon capture technologies. America too will remain heavily invested in coal, and could generate up to 35% of its electricity from coal using carbon capture technologies. South Africa, which is now heavily dependent on coal, could generate 80% of its electricity from solar energy, while countries such as Australia could achieve cuts in their emissions by switching to electric cars and public transport. The report acknowledges that the technologies it incorporates in its findings – including carbon capture – are not yet available on a widespread, commercial scale. It also makes no attempt to offer a cost-benefit analysis of the sweeping transformation that would be needed in all 15 countries to keep warming within 2C. Sachs said those aspects would be dealt with in a final report due next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/05/24-guide-past-eight-seasons-tv-kiefer-sutherland-jack-bauer-recap","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-05T13:18:00Z","webTitle":"Bone up on Bauer: your quick guide to 24's past eight seasons (and TV movie)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/05/24-guide-past-eight-seasons-tv-kiefer-sutherland-jack-bauer-recap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/may/05/24-guide-past-eight-seasons-tv-kiefer-sutherland-jack-bauer-recap","fields":{"headline":"Bone up on Bauer: your guide to 24's past eight seasons (and TV movie)","bodyText":"Jack Bauer is a husband, a father and a man in possession of a berserk clench-jawed glare. He works for CTU, the counter-terrorism wing of the US government. He discovers an assassination plot against presidential hopeful David Palmer. However, there's a mole inside CTU and his daughter Kim (who is an idiot) has been kidnapped by two men with awful taste in music. The terrorists want Jack to kill Palmer but he outwits them. Then his wife gets murdered and Jack is sad. Eighteen months later, Jack returns to action because there's a nuclear bomb somewhere. He immediately chops a man's head off because he's just that sort of guy. He helps his boss to take the bomb onto a plane and crash it into the desert because, again, he's that just that sort of guy. Kim (who is an idiot) spends a full day running around screaming at things. President Palmer gets poisoned and keels over. Three years later, and Jack is now a heroin addict. But don't worry, because he barely mentions it. This time he's got a helper called Chase, who loves Kim (who is an idiot). Terrorists want to release a toxic virus, plus the wife of President Palmer (he survived the poisoning!) is a murderer now. The day is saved when Jack chops Chase's hand off for some reason. Eighteen months after that, someone wants to blow up a load of nuclear power plants. Jack stops them, of course, but the new president is a douchebag who wants Jack dead, so he fakes his own death and runs away. Eighteen months later, most of the cast immediately get assassinated. There's some nerve agent too, and the douchebag president did it all. The Chinese grab Jack and start torturing him on a boat. Jack returns 20 months later with a beard to discover that David Palmer's brother is now the least believable president in the history of American fiction. There have been a series of suicide bombings, leading to a nuclear explosion that destroys most of LA. But don't worry, because barely anyone mentions it. This time the baddie is Jack's own dad (who was also the farmer from Babe), so Jack blows him up on an oil rig. Jack is sad. Jack goes to Africa to clear his head, but ends up murdering loads of soldiers anyway. Jack goes to Washington to face torture charges, just in time to stop baddies from blowing up the White House. He takes a full canister of a weaponised prion virus to the face, but is saved by advances in stem-cell research. Also, Kim's back. Still an idiot. Finally, Jack goes to New York to murder as many members of the Russian government as he can for some reason.

Accused by Labour and Lib Dems of exceeding his powers, he overrides local planning systems and inspectors, pulling 85% of wind energy capacity out of the standard process for purely political purposes. Just as onshore wind becomes the cheapest renewable energy source, the Conservatives have committed to effectively abolishing it: their manifesto will pledge to remove subsidies, jeopardising future investment and rural jobs. Small local nimby groups find Pickles ever-eager to block windfarms in their back yards. That’s despite overwhelming public support, where poll after poll finds two thirds are in favour of onshore windfarms, including in their own districts, surprisingly resistant to the vigorous climate-change denial and anti-windfarm campaign by the Conservatives and their press. You might think people living somewhere that has suffered extreme flooding, almost certainly climate-change related, would welcome wind turbines in their district. But no, not in the Somerset levels. Remember last winter, when reporters in waders filled the nightly news for weeks as the river Parrett burst its banks and flooded hundreds of homes. Prince Charles arrived in green wellies and pronounced it “a tragedy” that more had not been done. That brought David Cameron hurrying along in his wellies too, calling it a “biblical” flood. He promised that “everything than can be done will be done” – except, it seems, clean energy. Local Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger blamed Chris Smith, chair of the Environment Agency – conveniently a former Labour minister – calling him “a little git” and a “coward” and said that he’d “stick his head down the loo and flush”. That’s perhaps the sort of thing a public school, ex-army, great-great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria does: he’s chair of the Commons energy committee and an anti-wind campaigner too. In all of Somerset there is just one wind turbine, so you might think the proposal by Ecotricity to put up a modest four in the Parrett valley would have had a fair wind. It would power 6,769 homes. But no, it was opposed by a small local group – and Pickles “recovered” the application and turned it down. I went to look at the aptly named Black Ditch site, and this is no beauty spot: in fact it would be hard to find a duller patch of England. It sits beside the busy M5 motorway, by a demolished Royal Ordnance factory and a man-made river channel that used to service wartime munitions-making. This dreary strip of flat lands is crisscrossed in all directions by enormous pylons bestriding the countryside, carrying electricity from the nearby Hinkley Point nuclear power station across fields where shrink-wrapped black plastic hay bales litter the landscape. But pylons and plastic stir none of the deep politics of wind turbines which have become symbols in the warfare between climate preservers (left) and climate-change deniers (right). Beauty is in the eye of the beholder – so to the Ukip/Mail/Telegraph/Tory MP faction they are monstrosities. To many others, the sight of those great slow-turning white sails raises their spirits as a symbol of hope. But this is an unbridgeable divide, in politics and in aesthetics, the two closely allied. Not long ago Cameron was the man fixing a wind turbine to his roof, promising “the greenest government ever”. He knew then that wind power was popular – and it still is. So what’s changed? Two things: a hefty slice of his party has taken leave of its senses and is now speeding on high-octane ideology, regardless of all road signs pointing to public opinion, let alone national interest. Climate-change denial is a symptom of the frenzy – 101 Tory MPs signed up to it with Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, and Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, stirring up windfarm aversion. But the great game-changer has been the arrival of Ukip, with its three main aims – out of Europe, end immigration and, oddly, a ban onshore turbines, which put the wind up Cameron. However, 40% of Ukip voters support onshore wind and I doubt many votes in the recent Clacton byelection were moved by turbine phobia. On the contrary, you would expect their voters to rally to the cause of home-grown energy, freeing us from dependency on risky foreign potentates or pesky French neighbours. Comres, polling for RenewableUK finds parties opposing onshore wind lose twice as many votes as they gain. In the 40 most marginal Labour and Conservative seats, opposing onshore wind loses four times votes as many as it gains, and more voters for all three main parties are turned off by anti-wind attitudes. Pickles’s blocking of windfarms in the last year has lost over £500m in income and 2,000 scarce rural jobs, killing off investment in an industry providing the cheapest renewables. The EU has just reported that onshore wind is cheaper than coal, gas and nuclear energy when the cost of pollution is factored in, especially the high cost of climate change. Both Tory and Lib Dems promised that nuclear would get no extra subsidy: but EDF building at Hinkley C has been guaranteed a 10% profit for 30 years – and no one adds in the vast insurance bill they would bear if the state didn’t underwrite nuclear disaster. This isn’t an argument against nuclear, which is needed in the mix, but a reminder of how cheap onshore wind has become – the price would fall ever faster if only Pickles were stopped. Once he called himself a champion of localism, but now he removes decisions from the local planning process, unless he agrees with them. When it comes to fracking – highly unpopular, especially in marginals – the government legislates to ride roughshod over huge local objections. Labour has been vociferous, and so has the wind industry, but they say it’s impossible to get this story into anywhere but the Guardian, the Financial Times and the Independent: the rest are climate-change deniers and onshore wind refusers. The Tory retreat from the cheapest clean energy is another sign of their retreat from reality, on climate change as on the EU. • This article was amended on 28 October 2014 to correct a reference to the blocking of windfarms resulting in the loss of more than £500bn in income. That figure has been corrected to £500m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"big-energy-debate/wind-power-popular-energy-source-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"big-energy-debate","sectionName":"The big energy debate","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-28T08:10:00Z","webTitle":"Wind power most popular source of energy in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/big-energy-debate/wind-power-popular-energy-source-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/big-energy-debate/wind-power-popular-energy-source-uk","fields":{"headline":"Wind power most popular source of energy in UK","bodyText":"Wind power is the most popular source of energy in the UK, according to an exclusive survey of attitudes towards the energy market carried out on behalf of the Guardian. A study of more than 2,000 people across incomes and political allegiances found that windfarms would be the most welcomed form of power source, as plans are made to develop new energy capacity in the UK. Almost half of respondents (48%) said an onshore windfarm would receive positive reception if it was developed within five miles of their home. By contrast, only a fifth could say the same for a new coal powered station, and just 27% said a new nuclear power station would be welcomed in their area. Fracking garnered the least support: 19% of respondents said development of this new technology would receive a positive local reception. Support for wind power was high among supporters of all parties, though enthusiasm for onshore wind was lowest among those who identified themselves as Conservative (39%, compared with 56% among Labour voters and 45% for those who said they were aligned with Ukip). The survey results come as government data revealed there had been a sharp rise in the percentage of onshore windfarm applications being rejected. Rejections across the UK jumped from 25-29% in 2009-12 to 41% in 2013. Communities secretary Eric Pickles has told planners to give greater weight to local concerns over windfarm applications, claiming \"current planning decisions on onshore wind are not always reflecting a locally-led planning system\". The Conservative party has pledged to drop subsidies for new onshore wind turbines if elected with an overall majority in 2015. And despite evidence that support is generally widespread, Pickles has taken 35 wind power planning appeals out of the hands of the planning inspectorate since last June, refusing eight and approving two so far, and opening his party up to criticism of \"heavy-handed intervention\". The Guardian study, carried out by Harris Interactive during April 2014, revealed that support was even higher for offshore wind, with more than half (55%) saying they believed it would be welcomed (though all respondents were open to answer this question, regardless of their location). Despite a bitter debate between central and local government politicians, 40% of voters say they \"neither support nor oppose\" fracking for shale gas in the UK. Just 8% say they \"very much support\" the policy, compared with the 18% who \"very much oppose\" it. Only a third (32%) said energy prices had an influence on their voting intentions, despite the fact that the majority (81%) said they were concerned about the rise in the cost of energy. This ranked highest among concerns about the energy market, above cutting carbon emissions (52%) and the possibility of power cuts (51%). Despite being among the cheapest in Europe, 71% said they perceived UK energy prices as unreasonable. Two-thirds of respondents believed that UK prices were higher than the global averages, and higher than other EU countries. Due to fears about rising prices, two-thirds said they were willing to consume less electricity during peak times. This article is part of the Guardian's #bigenergydebate series.

Energy companies are more often cited as part of the problem of climate change, generating the lion's share of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, amounting to around 40% of the total. But they will also suffer as global warming picks up pace, as generators – from nuclear reactors to coal-fired power plants – feel the brunt of the weather changes. Many large plants are particularly at risk from droughts, because they need water to cool their facilities, and floods, because they lack protection from sudden storms. Electricity distribution networks are also likely to be affected. The vulnerability of energy systems to natural shocks was shown starkly when the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan had to be closed down following the 2011 tsunami, which prompted governments around the world to review their nuclear policies. The World Energy Council (WEC), which compiled the study along with Cambridge University and the European Climate Foundation, urged generators to examine their vulnerability to climate change, saying that with suitable adaptations – such as protecting power plants from water shortages and building resilience into power networks – the worst of the problems could be avoided. Christoph Frei, secretary general of WEC, said governments must play a key role in ensuring the world's vital infrastructure is protected: \"Climate change is certain to impact the energy sector. We need robust and transparent policy frameworks to unlock the long-term investments that are urgently needed to deliver the future we want. Leadership will be required at all levels.\" Despite efforts to increase energy efficiency, the amount of energy used globally is still set to rise. But the effects of this could be mitigated if companies invest in renewable and low-carbon forms of energy, such as windfarms and nuclear power. Another key focus must be energy distribution networks – grids – according to the report, as new technology can be used to make grids \"smarter\", saving energy by distributing energy from generators to users in more intelligent ways than has been the case with existing grid infrastructure technology, much of which is now decades old. \"The time has come to get real about the challenges facing the energy sector,\" Frei said. Hundreds of billions of pounds will be needed to invest around the globe in making energy systems more resilient in the coming decade, but most of this is money that must be spent anyway, just to keep the current systems going. If that investment is directed towards lower carbon fuels and greater efficiency, this could cut carbon dioxide emissions in the longer term, the study found. Switching to low-carbon energy would also reduce air pollution and bring health benefits, the authors said. However, there is little sign so far that energy companies around the world have taken up this message. Fossil fuels continue to dominate new investments in energy generation capacity, according to the International Energy Agency. Attempts to create a global price on carbon emissions, that could help to reverse this trend, have largely foundered. Philippe Joubert, executive chairman of WEC's global electricity initiative, and former president of Alstom Power, said large companies were taking note. \"Leading businesses in this sector increasingly realise that business as usual is no longer possible or acceptable.\" The report, released at the Asian Clean Energy Forum on Wednesday in Manila, was based on the latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which predicted that the effects of climate change would become vastly more apparent in the coming decades, if no, or inadequate, action was taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/dec/17/2013-in-review-the-year-fracking-shook-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-17T11:15:11Z","webTitle":"2013 in review: the year fracking shook the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/dec/17/2013-in-review-the-year-fracking-shook-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/dec/17/2013-in-review-the-year-fracking-shook-the-world","fields":{"headline":"2013 in review: the year fracking shook the UK","bodyText":"The pumping of water, sand and chemicals underground at pressure to crack rocks and release gas dominated headlines in 2013. Fracking for shale gas, even if the process has not actually been producing much energy beyond its homeland in the US, has barely been out of the public consciousness. In the UK, drilling for oil by fracking explorers Cuadrilla in Sussex roused one of the biggest environmental protests in years, as thousands marched outside the village of Balcombe and Green party MP Caroline Lucas was arrested. A similar series of protests was mirrored in Manchester, later in the year. Public figures and industry bodies lined up to say the technology should go ahead in the UK, from David Cameron down to geologists, water companies and some environmentalists, and the government laid out sweeteners of £100,000 for communities who live near any shale gas wells that are fracked. Around the world, the Polish environment minister was sacked for not green-lighting fracking projects quickly enough – halfway through the UN climate talks, no less – fracking licences were granted for a wildlife reserve in Botswana and indigenous protesters in Canada fought against the expansion of shale gas operations. Enormous potential reserves were identified in Australia. The ramping up of exploration and awareness around shale gas is part of the wider picture of fossil fuel companies looking for unconventional sources of energy. Elsewhere, companies continued their efforts to push into the Arctic to drill for oil and gas. When a small group of Greenpeace activists boarded one of those efforts, a Gazprom rig in the Barents Sea, it inadvertently turned into one of the biggest stories of the year. The Russian authorities, which had allowed a similar protest the year before, responded by winching armed coastguards off a helicopter onto the group's Arctic Sunrise vessel, arresting the 28 activists and two journalists onboard, and detaining them without trial for several months, before finally releasing them on bail. They are still in Russia, and have been told they cannot leave – yet. Coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, hasn't gone away, despite talk of gas replacing it, the US taking steps in the summer to clean up old coal power plants, and Daw Mill, one of the UK's few remaining coal mines, closing. Instead, the respected energy thinktank, the IEA, predicted that coal was now on track to challenge oil as the world's biggest source of energy, and UK greenhouse gas emissions jumped 4.5% because coal was so cheap. It emerged that China now burns almost as much coal as the rest of the world combined – bad news for the climate, but good news for Australia, which approved two mega coal mines in Queensland. The short-term impacts of coal were still on display – some of the most dramatic smog episodes of the year in major cities of China including Shanghai and Beijing were blamed on coal-burning. The year ended with the UK and US saying they would no longer fund coal projects in the developing world and the UN's climate chief telling the coal industry to leave its reserves in the ground. Nuclear power had a good year in the UK, but a bad one pretty much everywhere else. Most of Japan's nuclear reactors remained offline, forcing the country to rely on imported fossil fuels for energy. A steady drip of worrying news emerged from Fukushima, where workers continued cleanup efforts on the nuclear power station amid repeated leaks of radioactive material. In the UK, energy company EDF struck a deal with the government guaranteeing an above-market rate for nuclear electricity, paving the way for the country's first new nuclear power station in over 20 years. But critics said the deal was a bad for consumers, and just this week the boss of Ineos, one of the UK's biggest energy consumers, said the electricity from the new reactors would be too expensive. The government also tried to restart stalled efforts to find a geological site for a long-term underground nuclear waste dump, by changing the rules on which councils have the final say. In the UK, Labour leader, Ed Miliband, sparked a debate over energy prices by promising to freeze them until 2017 if his party comes to power in 2015. In response, prime minister David Cameron was reported as saying he would \"get rid of the green crap\" – the subsidies for environmental and social programmes on energy bills. The political tussle inside the coalition ultimately led to changes that cut £50 off the average household's energy bill but watered down the government's main scheme for making energy companies insulate people's homes. Meanwhile, renewable energy continued its upward march, despite subsidies being cut in several countries. In the UK, the amount of wind power installed at sea and on land was up by over 40% on the year before, including the opening of the world's biggest offshore windfarm, the London Array, which David Cameron attended and called \"a great day for Britain and a big win for renewable energy.\" Elsewhere in the country new plans for a barrage across the Severn estuary were rejected, and the government delayed (again) an incentive scheme to encourage householders to switch to renewable forms of heat, such as biomass. Globally, it emerged that wind power had expanded by around 20% in 2012 and several countries, notably Spain and Germany, set new records for how much wind power they generated. The cost of solar photovoltaic panels, which generate electricity, plummeted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/dec/21/oil-price-fall-economics-russia-us-scotland-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-21T00:05:00Z","webTitle":"How oil price fall will affect crude exporters – and the rest of us","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/21/oil-price-fall-economics-russia-us-scotland-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/dec/21/oil-price-fall-economics-russia-us-scotland-uk","fields":{"headline":"How oil price fall will affect crude exporters – and the rest of us","bodyText":"John Paul Getty’s formula for success was to rise early, work hard and strike oil. But a dependence on the black stuff can create its own problems, especially when the price tumbles as it has over the last few months. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has almost halved from $115 in the summer to stabilise around $60 last week. Most forecasters expect the cost of oil to remain low well into next year. Getty became a billionaire oil magnate after four years of speculative drilling in the Saudi Arabian desert proved to be worth the risk. Now the house of Saud appears willing to wait almost as long for its own victory. The plan, agreed with Opec, maintains output, ignoring demands for cuts to push the price back up again. As the dominant Opec member, and keen to protect its own market share, the Saudis have forced the others to take the long view with a strategy that aims to put out of business all those producers that have flooded the market in the last few years and dragged the price lower. US fracking firms, where production costs are high, should be the first to feel the financial pain. But there will be collateral damage to others too. Iran may find itself running out of cash. And then there is Russia, which is heading for a deep recession next year as gas prices follow oil to lows not seen in 10 years. There will be winners too. The UK, now a net importer of oil, has already benefited by an estimated £3m-a-day reduction in fuel costs. Businesses will gain from cheaper energy, and cheaper petrol in effect puts more cash in consumers’ pockets. Taken in the round, global GDP could rise by 0.2% to 0.5% as the wheels of trade are lubricated a little more. 1. The US There is a popular theory that the US wants to see oil prices low for some time to undermine Vladimir Putin’s ambitions in eastern Europe, put pressure on Iran and spur a global economy desperately in need of cheap energy. In the US alone, each $10-per-barrel drop in the price of oil boosts GDP by 0.1%, according to Swiss investment bank UBS. Fracked oil and gas across the central plains of the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska, coupled with oil from Canadian tar sands, has slashed demand for oil imports to the US – resulting in the world market for oil and gas being flooded. Alongside rising supply is waning demand, especially as Japan looks to switch back on its nuclear power stations and China’s manufacturing sector growth slows. Yet a prolonged period of low prices could put the entire fracking industry out of business. Frackers have a break even point of $110 a barrel or above and have few resources to maintain uneconomic production. Frackers have pushed output from 5m barrels a day in 2008 to 8.5m in June this year. Gas production is up by a third since 2005. One US academic estimated that one shale find in south Texas added $87bn to the US economy in 2013. The closure of one well after another, which is already happening, is not therefore something the White House can ignore. 2. Venezuela Only a couple months ago, a standard Barbie doll sold for about $200 in Venezuelan shops. In the runup to Christmas she can be bought for as little as $2.50, while stocks still last, following President Nicolas Maduro’s bizarre effort at subsidising festive consumerism. Worse, the cash used to buy Barbies will soak up much of the country’s foreign currency, already depleted after years of corrupt import scams and now the falling oil price. One of the worst-hit members of Opec, Venezuela has a oil price beak-even point of $117 a barrel. Such is the inefficiency of its industry and the profligacy of its government that some industry experts expect it to run out of money next year. Instead of Father Christmas, Maduro may then have to turn into the Grinch, imposing even greater levels of austerity on an already beleaguered nation. 3. UK In 2005 the UK became a net importer of oil, complicating its relationship with a source of bumper revenues over the previous 25 years. The recent fall in the oil price helps the balance of payments and gives a price cut to consumers worth £3m a day, but it hits an industry that keeps much of Scotland’s west coast in employment and provides the exchequer with significant if declining tax revenues. The boss of Wood Group, an oil engineering firm, said 15,000 jobs could go next year as output drops to 800,000 barrels a day. Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish National party leader, is likely to be recalibrating her stance on North Sea oil as a secure base for the finances of an independent Scotland (her predecessor, Alex Salmond, based his economic rationale for independence prior to the September referendum on oil at $113). Such is the power of fluctuating oil prices to influence economic decision-making that it was mentioned last week as not only putting extra pounds in shoppers pockets for Christmas spending, but also depressing the inflation rate to the extent that Bank of England officials must delay interest rate rises scheduled for next summer. 4. Russia President Vladimir Putin dismissed concerns at his annual press conference last week that Russia could default on its debts should oil prices remain low next year. But he was kidding few that Russia can prosper with prices at $60. Russia’s parliament recently approved a three-year budget that assumed an oil price of $100 a barrel in 2015-17. The finance ministry now expects oil to trade at $80 next year, and the economy to contract by 0.8%. Budget revisions are ruled out. Nevertheless, with oil and gas accounting for 70% of exports and 50% of tax receipts, anything less than $100 a barrel will mean big budget cuts and far deeper recession. It looks as if infrastructure spending will be sacrificed to protect welfare and defence budgets – with the incursion into Ukraine aiding the armed forces’ demand for a 30% budget boost. Russian companies that borrowed from western banks are also in trouble. The corporate sector tapped the west for cheap credit and must pay the interest on the loans in dollars at a time when a collapse in the rouble means dollars are more expensive. Oligarchs have lobbied Putin to help pay their loans. So far the president has said no, preferring to rely on the central bank defending the rouble by pushing interest rates to 17%. 5. Iran As one of the targets for both Saudi and US foreign policy, Tehran is in a bind. The government has increased spending to placate its westernised middle class at the very moment US sanctions and the low oil price are both eating into its budget. The US hopes that a deal is possible limiting Iran’s nuclear ambitions while the Saudis want an end to Iranian-funded jihadis in the region. The first is possible and the second unlikely, but cash-for-terrorism could be more circumscribed following a prolonged period of low oil prices. 6. Saudi Arabia The desert state has amassed a $1trn war chest to see it through periods of lower prices. Only last week a clearly relaxed finance minister Ibrahim Alassaf said his 2015 budget would go ahead despite “challenging” global economic conditions. Alassaf has championed the kingdom’s “counter-cyclical” fiscal policy, which helped build up a mountain of foreign assets when oil prices were high. So while the world’s top oil exporter is believed to need an average crude price above $90 a barrel to balance its budget, and a first budget deficit since 2009 will involve the sale of foreign assets to balance the books, it can survive for many years at $60 a barrel.

To limit the global production of oil and gas over the longer term, especially fracked oil and gas in the US and Europe, which have previously depended on Middle Eastern supplies.

It will be the first time in nearly two decades that the UK has not had a clear national target on renewable energy, and the effect of that on the burgeoning green technology sector is so far unclear. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said no target was needed as the government's carbon budgets will require a massive growth in low-carbon energy. But this could come from nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency or an expansion of the use of gas. \"The market will decide,\" he said. That offered cold comfort to renewable energy experts, who argue that the cost of fossil-fuel generation in warming the climate is not reflected in current coal- and gas-fired generation prices, leaving renewable energy at a disadvantage and the UK at risk of dangerous climate change. The government also ignored the key question of whether offering the French nuclear company EDF a guaranteed income of at least £80bn from energy bill-payers – which it did late last year to ensure that a new nuclear power station is built in Somerset – represented a triumph of market forces. The offer to EDF, partly owned by the French government, was nearly double current electricity prices. The lack of a national renewables target will be a major change, as current targets, which run to 2020, have been credited with assisting the growth of wind and solar power, which now make up 15% of electricity generation. A large shortfall in electricity generation is expected when current coal-fired stations are taken out of service. Without a renewables target, Energy Department officials said, it would be possible for a large proportion of this shortfall to be met by gas-fired power generation. That may help in meeting the 2030 emissions target the government has agreed to, but new gas-fired power stations will continue to run for 25 years, which could put post-2030 targets in doubt. The Treasury has been eager to promote shale gas exploration in the UK as a way of making up the looming \"energy gap\". However, tax breaks and other incentives to shale gas may soon be challenged under European state aid rules, as the Guardian reported this week. Renewable energy companies were furious at the government's refusal to set goals, which they argue have been key to promoting the growth of clean forms of power and bringing down the price of such generation. The Renewable Energy Association (REA) said the current 2020 targets – which were set at an EU level, of a 20% share for renewables by that date, but which include a specific target for the UK of generating 15% of energy from renewables – had been \"particularly valuable when negative rhetoric from ministers has damaged market confidence in the UK\". That damage to confidence was starkly illustrated last week when RWE Npower, the German energy giant, said it would halve its planned renewable investments in the UK. Other investments in renewable manufacturing capacity have been slow to materialise. Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the REA, warned that relying purely on market forces, rather than setting targets as other EU states have done, was short-sighted. \"We're about to find out what happens when theoretical economics meets the real world,\" she said. \"Theory suggests a technology-neutral approach is economically efficient. \"But experience shows that binding renewables targets do two things. First, they give a major long-term boost to investor confidence, helping accelerate market growth and technology-cost reduction. Second, politics frequently trumps economics in the real world, and when politicians go wobbly on renewables, the targets help keep investment flowing.\" Davey was scathing of the previous Labour government's targets on renewables, which were not met but which contributed to the recent growth in renewable energy. Liberal Democrats used to support a target on renewables as a way to combat the market failure that has seen fossil fuels remain dominant in the UK's energy mix despite years of dire warnings on climate change and successive government targets on cutting emissions.

You had to feel sorry for him. Caught between the anti-nuclear brigade (of which he was once a prominent member), the climate change fanatics and the Labour party, which is trying to make as much capital out of energy prices as it can, he was reduced to barking angrily. Also it must be pretty rough being a Lib Dem. The party is beginning to look like one of those old nuclear power stations, many on the fringes of the country, which has outlived its usefulness and is waiting to be decommissioned and turned into rubble. Maybe we could persuade the Chinese to invest in a new centre party. The way Davey presented it, you'd imagine that the deal cut with EDF was the result of tough, hard-faced negotiations through the night with no quarter asked or given, ending in triumph for the British side. Yes, they got the \"strike price\" – what we have agreed to pay them – at £89.50 per megawatt hour, which it turns out is just twice what we pay for power now, and 30% more than a similar power station in France is paid. So if this is the government's idea of success, we can reflect on what a failure might involve, and shiver. (Actually, No 10 says that if fuel prices are too high, we could avoid shivering by wearing jumpers indoors. I don't know why this is such an outrage. Do we really have a God-given right to wander round in shorts and Hawaiian shirts in the middle of winter?) There was a slightly surreal touch to the discussion as Labour's new energy spokesperson, Caroline Flint, was unable to get to the House by train from Doncaster, owing to power problems. Davey said this proved we needed to plan ahead to keep our supplies. In fact it had nothing to do with a shortage of electricity, just a few Network Rail overhead lines coming down – because wind and rain are almost unknown in this country, which is why we don't plan for them. In her absence Davey announced gravely that he respected those who opposed nuclear power in principle. \"I have had my concerns, and so has my party.\" This elicited a huge jeer from the Labour benches, who recall the days when the Lib Dems were totally opposed to all nukes, and wanted nuclear-free zones scattered around the country. Tom Greatrex, standing in for Flint, said he was puzzled why the coalition was scornful about a Labour energy price freeze for 20 months, when it claimed to fix prices to the penny 35 years ahead. Davey told him he was economically illiterate, which is what MPs say when someone disagrees with them on the numbers. Michael Meacher, for Labour, claimed the deal was a \"colossal financial disaster\". Davey said that the contract was \"the most transparent deal ever made\", which I suppose it is. Like a plateglass window you can see through it, but you'll get nowhere banging your head on it over and over again because you can't possibly understand it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/jul/01/replacement-trident-isnt-justifiable-security-cost-danny-alexander","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-01T13:04:00Z","webTitle":"A like-for-like Trident replacement isn't justifiable in terms of security or cost | Danny Alexander","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/01/replacement-trident-isnt-justifiable-security-cost-danny-alexander","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/01/replacement-trident-isnt-justifiable-security-cost-danny-alexander","fields":{"headline":"A like-for-like Trident replacement isn't justifiable in terms of security or cost","bodyText":"Today's report by the British American Security Information Council (Basic) is a significant addition to the vital debate about the future of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent. The group of respected senior political, military and diplomatic figures have set out thought-provoking questions about how best to configure the nation's deterrent in the future. Their thinking on the possible number of Successor submarines and whether we need to maintain continuous at-sea deterrence merits close consideration. The defence of the nation is the first responsibility of any government. Because of their immense destructive power, their political significance and their cost and complexity, nuclear weapons have a particular place in defence thinking, and the policies around their deployment have an importance that is hard to overstate. I recently oversaw the most in-depth government study into the options for Britain's future nuclear deterrent, the Trident Alternatives Review (Tar). This ran for 26 months and took evidence from numerous civilian and military experts in the field. While the Basic report acknowledges that the authors felt unqualified to identify alternatives to Trident and its current deployment patterns, our government review was able to identify future alternatives and options. I subscribe to the view that Britain should remain a nuclear power and that our deterrent should continue to be submarine based. However, I and my fellow Liberal Democrats do not accept that we should be locked into configuring and deploying our nuclear forces in the future as we have done in the past when the security environment has changed so fundamentally from the cold war era. During the cold war, there was a credible threat of a surprise massive attack against this country or Nato allies. Our nuclear forces needed to be available within minutes in order to give credibility to our policy of deterrence. This is why we maintained continuous at-sea deterrence; we kept at least one armed submarine on patrol 24/7, 365 days of the year. But the Berlin Wall has been down now for 25 years and the threat of \"state on state\" attack is much reduced. This new environment has quite rightly already led to significant changes in the composition and deployment of our conventional forces. However, we still maintain and deploy our nuclear resources as if the cold war were at its height. As well as not matching the security threat, this also fails to meet our wider international obligations to work towards reducing nuclear weapons, as other nuclear nations have attempted. We should end continuous at-sea deterrence, and conduct patrols in a pattern required to match the rising or falling perceived threat. These patrols would be supplemented by extensive and regular exercise patrols. Changing our posture is rational and would show that we are serious about moving further down the ladder of disarmament. The financial impact of our decisions on nuclear weapons must also be an integral part of the debate. As a coalition, we have had to take some very difficult decisions to stabilise the public finances and, in turn, the defence budget. The scale of the deficit we inherited from Labour is common knowledge. What is less well known is that we inherited from Labour a defence equipment \"black hole\" which, by the end of the decade, would have equalled an entire year's defence budget. The coalition has put the defence equipment budget on a sound footing. We also have to consider how the costs of nuclear deterrence fit in with the other, equally important, calls for defence funding from our conventional forces. To put this in perspective, the cost of our nuclear deterrent in the future could equal one-fifth of total defence equipment spending. Reducing the number of deterrent-carrying submarines from four to three would save £4bn over the expected life of the system. A like-for-like replacement of Trident, deployed in the same way, will unnecessarily stretch budgets and constrain spending on other defence priorities. Something has to give. I see nothing in the Basic report that changes my view that our national security would be best served by reducing the number of Successor submarines from four to three and ending the policy of continuous at-sea deterrence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/gallery/2012/mar/12/sellafield-nuclear-power-energy-in-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-12T11:53:53Z","webTitle":"The story of Sellafield nuclear power station – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2012/mar/12/sellafield-nuclear-power-energy-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/gallery/2012/mar/12/sellafield-nuclear-power-energy-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"The story of Sellafield nuclear power station – in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/dec/03/un-2c-global-warming-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-03T23:28:00Z","webTitle":"UN's 2C target will fail to avoid a climate disaster, scientists warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/03/un-2c-global-warming-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/dec/03/un-2c-global-warming-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"UN's 2C target will fail to avoid a climate disaster, scientists warn","bodyText":"The limit of 2C of global warming agreed by the world's governments is a \"dangerous target\", \"foolhardy\" and will not avoid the most disastrous consequences of climate change, new research from a panel of eminent climate scientists warned on Tuesday. In a new paper, the climate scientist Professor James Hansen and a team of international experts found the most dangerous effects of a warming climate – sea level rise, Arctic ice melt, extreme weather – would begin kicking in with a global temperature rise of 1C. Allowing warming to reach 2C would be simply too late, Hansen said. \"The case we make is that 2C itself is a very dangerous target to be aiming for,\" he told the Guardian. \"Society should reassess what are dangers levels, given the impacts that we have already seen.\" The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal PLoS One, represents Hansen's most public intervention so far into the world of climate policy, following his retirement earlier in 2013 from Nasa's Goddard Institute of Space Studies. Hansen, who left Nasa to be more free to act as a climate advocate, set up a new climate policy programme at the Earth Institute in September. In a separate action, he intervened in November in support of a law suit demanding the federal government act to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. The new study, however, was aimed at marshalling the expertise of 17 other climate and policy experts from the UK, Australia, France, Sweden and Switzerland as well as the US, to outline the dangerous consequences of sticking to the 2C warming target endorsed by the United Nations and world leaders. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in its major in October that the world had only about 30 years left before it exhausted the rest of the 1,000 gigaton carbon emission budget estimated to lead to 2C warming. But Hansen and his colleagues warned that the UN target would not avoid dangerous consequences, even if it kept within that carbon budget. \"Fossil fuel emissions of 1,000 gigaton, sometimes associated with a 2C global warming target, would be expected to cause large climate change with disastrous consequences. The eventual warming from one gigaton fossil fuel emissions likely would reach well over 2C, for several reasons. With such emissions and temperature tendency, other trace greenhouse gases including methane and nitrous oxide would be expected to increase, adding to the effect of CO2,\" the researchers said. The paper draws on multiple strands of evidence to make its case, including the rapid decline of Arctic sea ice, mountain glaciers, and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, the expansion of hot, dry subtropical zones, the increase in drought and wildfires, and the loss of coral reefs because of ocean acidification. \"The main point is that the 2C target – which is almost out of reach now, or quickly becoming out of reach – is itself a dangerous target because it leads to a world that is greatly destabilised by rising sea levels and massive changes of climate patterns in different parts of the world,\" said Professor Jeff Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, one of the PLoS paper's authors. An even bigger problem however was that the international community was far from even reaching that inadequate target, Sachs said. \"Right now we are completely off track globally,\" he said. \"We are certainly not even in the same world as a 1C world. We are not even in a 2C world.\" The paper goes on to urge immediate cuts in global emissions of 6% a year as well as ambitious reforestation efforts to try to keep temperatures in check. The paper acknowledges such actions would be \"exceedingly difficult\" to achieve, but says it is urgent to begin reductions now, rather than wait until future decades. It warns that the targets will remain far out of reach so long with continued exploitation of fossil fuels, such as coal burning for electricity and continued exploitation of unconventional oil and gas. The paper also offers prescriptions, urging the adoption of a direct carbon tax at point of production and entry. \"Our policy implication is that we have to have a carbon fee and some of the major countries need to agree on that and if that were done it would be possible to actually get global emissions to begin to come down rapidly I think,\" Hansen said. The study also calls for an expansion of nuclear power – which will be controversial for environmental groups. Hansen has long been an advocate for nuclear power as a solution to climate change, and he has been critical of environmental groups for not coming on board. \"Surely a few decades ago it made sense to be very cautious about any further expansion of nuclear power but a lot has happened over last few decades,\" Hansen said. \"Climate change is going to be uncontrollable if we can't get carbon-free electricity ... Environmental groups need to look at the real world.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/sep/07/pmqs-may-corbyn-statement-brexit-australia-dashes-hopes-of-quick-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-07T15:45:38Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's Commons statement on the G20 and Brexit - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/07/pmqs-may-corbyn-statement-brexit-australia-dashes-hopes-of-quick-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/07/pmqs-may-corbyn-statement-brexit-australia-dashes-hopes-of-quick-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's Commons statement on the G20 and Brexit - Politics live","bodyText":"Owen Smith, the Labour leadership contender, has criticised Jeremy Corbyn for not fully backing Britain remaining in the single market. Smith was speaking after a Labour source refused to say Corbyn wanted the UK to stay a member. (See 1.55pm.) Smith said: Tens of thousands of Labour members and trade unionists will be worried to hear that Jeremy Corbyn appears to agree with David Davis that our membership of the single market is not worth fighting for. I have been consistent in saying that trade with Europe is in our national economic interest. It brings jobs, growth and investment. Later a senior Corbyn aide later said the Labour leader was in favour of negotiating full UK access to the single market, but would not accept a package including requirements on deregulation and privatisation, which he regarded as damaging to working people and public services. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has told the Commons home affairs committee that she will not limit the scope of the child abuse inquiry. Dame Lowell Goddard, who stood down as the inquiry’s chair over the summit, has said the scope of the inquiry is too wide. Rudd told MPs she disagreed. Rudd also said Goddard quit because she found the job too difficult and because she was lonely being so far from her home in New Zealand. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has denied allegations he “over-egged” Brexit warnings and insisted he was “absolutely serene” about policymaker actions taken surrounding the referendum. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Theresa May is going to hold talks with Donald Tusk, president of the European council, in Downing Street tomorrow, Number 10 has said. And the Guardian’s Hilary Osborne has also written an analysis looking at whether the government really is replacing every home sold under right to buy with a new one. She concluded that Theresa May was wrong. Huffington Post’s Martha Gill has written a good analysis of who was right when Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over housing at PMQs. It is not straightforward, but she gives it to Corbyn. She gives it to Corbyn. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has been giving evidence to the Treasury committee this afternoon. Here are some of the key points. I’m using tweets from the FT’s Chris Giles, Sky’s Ed Conway, the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn, Politics Home’s John Ashmore, the BBC’s Kamal Ahmed and Newsnight’s Lewis Goodall. Carney said that the Bank’s actions after the EU referendum had reduced the risk of a recession. He said that the economy was picking up, but that growth was still lower than before the EU referendum. He said recent purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data was encouraging. He defended the forecasts made about Brexit by the Bank before the referendum. He said he was confident the Bank’s interest rate cut would be passed on to mortgage holders. And this is from Newsnight’s Lewis Goodall. He is referring to this evidence that Charlie Bean, the Bank’s former deputy governor, gave to a House of Lords committee today. Sky News is playing the “let’s get Ken Livingstone talking about Hitler” game. And he’s up for it. Asked if he will apologise for the remarks that led to his suspension from Labour, he says what he said was true ... Theresa May has sought to close down public debate about the government’s Brexit negotiating stance by insisting that it will not be giving a “running commentary” on the subject. She used the phrase during PMQs in response to a question from the SNP’s Angus Robertson, and then elaborated as she delivered a statement to MPs on the G20 summit. (See 1.04pm.) Her comments mark a clear shift from what David Davis, the Brexit secretary, told MPs just two days ago. He said the government wanted to he wanted to build a “national consensus” on Brexit and to minimise uncertainty. (See 1.23pm.) May’s statement probably also marked the moment when she abandoned “Brexit means Brexit” as description of the government’s position; the soundbite, which May used repeatedly during the summer, did not feature at all in her statement today. Perhaps that means we’ve gone from “Brexit means Brexit” to “Brexit means - we won’t say”. Other commentators are also sceptical. These are from Huffington Post’s Owen Bennett. And this is from Bloomberg’s Robert Hutton. Jeremy Corbyn has criticised the “free trade dogma” backed by the Tories. Speaking in response to May he said the “reckless deregulation of the financial sector” had been to blame for the financial crisis. It’s a model of running the global economy that the prime minister acknowledges has produced huge increases in inequality and failed in its own terms. Rising levels of inequality in all of our economies fuel insecurities and pit people and communities against each other. The free trade dogma the prime minister spoke of has often been pursued at the expense of the world’s most fragile economies, and has been realised with destructive consequences for our environment. We need a UK trade agenda that protects people and the environment, and I urge the Prime Minister to stand with me against the use of Britain’s aid and trade policies to further the agenda of deregulation and privatisation in developing countries. Theresa May’s new government has pulled back from Michael Gove’s plan to introduce a major prison reform bill that formed the social reform centrepiece of David Cameron’s last Queen’s speech only four months ago. A Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn would ban fracking, ditch all coal-fired power stations and massively increase renewable energy, his leadership campaign has announced. As John Vidal reports, in the clearest signal yet that the party intends to embrace an ambitious environmental agenda and break its traditional strong links to mining and fossil fuel extraction, the Labour leader has pledged to phase out all coal power stations by the “early 2020s” and invest heavily in energy-saving to avoid building many new power stations. The GMB union has accused him of “wishful thinking”. Justin Bowden, the union’s national secretary for energy, said: Everyone gets how - over time - renewable energy sources have an important role to play in a sensibly conceived mixed energy policy. However wishful thinking doesn’t generate the power we need to heat homes, keep the lights on and the economy functioning; this means that until there are technological breakthroughs in carbon capture or solar storage then gas and nuclear power are the only reliable, low-carbon shows in town for all those days when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. Limiting the UK’s options on achieving energy self-sufficiency by proposing an outright ban on fracking is naive and short-sighted. Former Conservative universities minister Lord Willetts has spoken out against Theresa May’s plan to lift the ban on new grammar schools, underlining the opposition she is likely to face within her own party. The government has announced that it will make it easier for people to register to vote anonymously, a change that charities working with women who have experienced domestic abuse have long campaigned for.

Theresa May has now finished taking questions. I will post a summary soon. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry says Edinburgh could replace London as Europe’s leading financial centre when the UK leaves the EU, because Scotland wants to remain in the single market. May says the best thing for prosperity in Scotland is for Scotland to remain part of the UK. Labour’s Clive Efford asks if the UK is having to employ people from overseas to work as trade negotiators. May sidesteps the question. She says the department for international trade is building up its capacity. Labour’s Tristram Hunt asks what conversations May had with the Japanese about Brexit. And will May take control of these negotiations herself? May says she will focus her efforts on getting a good deal. The Conservative MP Nigel Adams asks May if Britain has the international trade negotiators it will need for the Brexit talks. May says for many years Britain did not need trade negotiators. But she is building up capacity through the department for international trade, she says. Many Labour pro-Europeans have been urging Theresa May to commit to keeping the UK in the single market. But Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is less keen on this, according to Labour sources. This is from Politics Home’s Kevin Schofield. And this is from the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn. Jessica Morden, the Labour MP for Newport East, says it was disappointing that May did not raise the issue of Chinese steel at her meeting with the Chinese president. May says she did raise this issue, but at the plenary session. A new forum to look at this is being set up, and China will sit on it. Sky’s economics editor Ed Conway thinks Theresa May’s “no running commentary” policy on Brexit is quite sensible. Emma Reynolds, the Labour MP, asks May to clarify that David Davis was wrong to say the UK would probably leave the single market, Boris Johnson was wrong to back a points-based immigration system and Liam Fox was wrong to say the UK would leave the customs union. May says she has said what she has said on these issues. Pat McFadden, the Labour former Europe minister, quotes what David Davis said in his ConservativeHome article in July about the new prime minister triggering a large round of global trade deal on 9 September. (See 9.18am.) Will May be triggering those trade deals in two days’ time? May says she had many discussions at the G20 about trade deals. Alex Salmond, the SNP foreign affairs spokesman, asks why Number 10 slapped down David Davis over what he said on Monday about the single market. And doesn’t she know a lot more about Brexit than May, because she has only been a Brexiteer for a few weeks. May says she wants the best deal for the UK. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw says giving up membership of the single market out of a “dogmatic” desire to cut immigration would be an act of self harm. May says Bradshaw should consider the message given by the public in the EU referendum. In his statement to MPs about Brexit on Monday David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said he wanted to build a “national consensus” on Brexit and to minimise uncertainty. First, as I said, we wish to build a national consensus around our position. Second, while always putting the national interest first, we will always act in good faith towards our European partners. Third, wherever possible we will try to minimise any uncertainty that change can inevitably bring. And, fourth, crucially, we will – by the end of this process – have left the European Union, and put the sovereignty and supremacy of this Parliament beyond doubt. Now May is saying the government will not reveal its hand and not provide a running commentary. (See 1.04pm.) Labour’s Yvette Cooper says it is important to know what May values in the Brexit negotiations. Does May value membership of the single market? And should staying in be an aim of the negotiations? May says she has answered this already. If people ask the same questions, they will get the same answer. She wants to get the right deal. But it will be a new relationship. And she will not be setting out her negotiating stance in advance. That would be the best way to come out with the worst deal. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, asks what assurances May can give the automative industry about tariffs and the customs union. May says she wants the right deal for trade on goods and services. It is important not to think of this as trying to replicate something here, or something there. The Brexit department is working on this, and asking people in sectors like the automative industry what they want. Then the government will “be ambitious” and go out there and get it, she says. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, says Australia has told the UK it is at the back of the queue for a trade deal. Can May confirm we will remain a member of the single market? We trusted the people on the departure. And we should trust them on the destination too, he says. May says the Australian trade minister has just set out the legal position; we cannot concluded a trade deal while we remain a member of the EU. But that does not mean we cannot negotiate with them in the meantime. Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, says he asked twice at PMQs if Britain would remain a full member of the single market. May would not reply. But this is not a “twist and turn”. This is a crucial issue. Can she reply? How many trade negotiators has the UK hired since the referendum vote, he asks. He says the government has ditched the idea of a points-based immigration system and is now adopting a Donald Trump policy - a wall. He asks May to confirm that the Vote Leave pledge that leaving the EU would raise £350m a week for the NHS is being broken. He says the Tories are suggesting EU citizens should not participate fully in Scottish public life. The SNP reject that, he says. Will May apologise for this? May says a points-based immigration system would not give the government control over who enters the country. Here is the full text of what Theresa May said about not providing a “running commentary” on Brexit. I know many people are keen to see rapid progress and to understand what post-Brexit Britain will look like. We are getting on with that vital work. But we must also think through the issues in a sober and considered way. And as I have said this is about getting the kind of deal that is ambitious and bold for Britain. It is not about the Norway model or the Swiss model or any other country’s model – it is about developing our own British model. So we will not take decisions until we are ready. We will not reveal our hand prematurely and we will not provide a running commentary on every twist and turn of the negotiation. And I say that because that is not the best way to conduct a strong and mature negotiation that will deliver the best deal for the people of this country. May is responding to Corbyn. She says the government is acting on hate crime. There was a recent meeting with the Polish on this. On Brexit, May says the UK will be negotiating a new relationship with the EU. That will include control on the movement of people into the UK. And it will cover trade. She says she will not be giving a running commentary. She wants to get the best deal. If she gave a running commentary, and gave away her negotiating hand, she could not achieve this. On steel, she says the G20 as a whole recognised the importance of this issue. On Hinkley, she says the say she works is not to take a decision without looking at the analysis first. She says she met the Saudi Crown Prince at the G20. She raised this issue. But she says the UK’s relationship with Saudi Arabia has helped to keep Britain safe. And she says free trade is the way to promote growth and spread prosperity. She will take no lectures from Corbyn on tackling poverty, she says. Free trade can be the best anti-poverty policy for those countries. She says she will spread this message “unashamedly” and is sorry Labour is turning its back on a policy that has helped the UK. Corbyn says the G20 was formed after the financial crisis. Rising levels of inequality pit communities against each other, he says. He says the free trade dogma May spoke of has often damaged the world’s most vulnerable community. Will May agree with him that trade policies must not further the deregulation agenda in developing countries? He asks May about her talks with the Chinese president on two issues. First, on steel, what assurances did he give that the Chinese would stop dumping cheap steal on Europe. And, second, on Hinkley Point, what did she say to the Chinese about this. He criticises the government for continuing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. Will May commit to stopping those arms sales. Jeremy Corbyn is now responding to May. He says he first went to China in 1998. That was the same year the Human Rights Act was passed. Labour is worried about the plans to repeal this. Corbyn says May has not revealed her hand on Brexit, or the government’s “many hands”. They are unclear what they want to do. He says Labour accepts the result of the EU referendum. But it has led to an increase in hate crime, and created uncertainty. David Davis says staying in the single market is “improbable”. Number 10 says that is not right. Which position is correct? He says parliament and the public must not be sidelined from the Brexit debate. May says she intends to return to the issue of illegal immigration when she next visits the UN. She says she wants Britain to lead a global effort to tackle human trafficking. When Britain voted to leave the EU, it did not vote to turn its back on the world, she says. We will make a success of Brexit, she says. May is now running though the G20 summit conclusions. Here is the summit communique. Theresa May is now making her statement the G20 and Brexit. She says she knows many people are keen to see rapid progress on Brexit. But the government must look at this in a sober and considered way. This is about looking for the right model for Britain. The government will look at this carefully, she says. It will not declare its hand prematurely. And it will not provide a running commentary on what it will do. May says the government will not provide a “running commentary” on the Brexit negotiations and that it will take its time to get the decision right. (This is quite a contrast from what David Davis, the Brexit secretary, was saying on Monday. He stressed the government’s desire to keep people informed. May’s comment suggests we might not be getting any more Commons updates on Brexit from Davis for quite some time.) Labour’s Jim Dowd asks May to send her condolences to the family and friends of the woman and boy killed in Penge last week by a dangerous driver. Will the government review the laws on dangerous driving? They are not tough enough, he says. May says this was a terrible tragedy. She is aware of the concern there is about the law on dangerous driving. The Ministry of Justice is looking at this, she says. Cheryl Gillan, the Conservative MP, asks about a drug newly available for a rare medical condition, a form of muscular dystrophy. May says this is a very important issue Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says the government still has not ratified the climate change treaty. Is the government still committed to action on climate change? And when will the treaty be ratified? May says it will be ratified. But she urges Lucas to congratulate the government. The UK has been rated the second best country in the world at tackling climate change. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, asks about the funding of NHS services in his constituency. May says all MPs are aware of the challenge there is in integrating health and social care. In some areas this is done very well. The government wants to spread good practice on this. The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake asks May for an assurance that, when £350m a week becomes available for the NHS (he is being sarcastic) the first £100m goes to his local hospital. May says the government will continue to fund the NHS. Julian Sturdy, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that universities will get the funding they need to thrive post Brexit after 2020. May says the chancellor has given assurances to universities. Looking ahead, a higher education bill is going through the House. That will ensure the UK can provided the university places it needs. Britain has a great record on universities, she says. Labour’s Helen Hayes asks for an assurance that funding for schools in London will not be cut by up to 20% when the school funding formula gets changed. May says this will be done carefully to see what impact there is on all parts of the country. According to a Guardian report from May, the figures for the number of homes sold under right to buy that get replaced are even worse than those Jeremy Corbyn quoted. He said just one in five was replaced. Hilary Osborne’s story quotes figures saying it was just one in 10. Snap PMQs verdict: An unedifying draw. Theresa May sounded confident, but her pre-scripted anti-Corbyn jibes (in response to questions two and three) came over as unprovoked, gratuitous and consequently rather cheap. It was reminiscent of David Cameron’s Bullingdon aggro, but Cameron found a way of at least making his attacks sound relevant. Corbyn ignored the obvious topics (grammar schools, or Brexit) and he asked solid, serious questions about one of the most pressing social questions of our time. But, as ever, he did not really use follow-up questions to drive home his points and so he did not really succeed in discomforting May at all. The PM was relatively weak on detail, but she did try to turn the argument into a wider one about values, and about home ownership, and on these points Corbyn’s responses were thin. Corbyn says only a year ago May voted against a Labour amendment to the housing bill saying all homes in the rented sector should be fit for habitation. The Treasury is losing £500m a year from unpaid tax from landlords in the housing sector. Unpaid tax, poor quality homes - doesn’t this require government intervention. May says the government has intervened. Thousands of landlords face further action. Corbyn may have a model of society where he does not want to see private landlords. But that is not what she wants. She wants people to have opportunities. Corbyn says he recognises the case for a mixed housing economy, but he does not want to see people pay excessive rent. Women’s Aid has raised concern about the cuts to housing benefit. Does May accept that very vulnerable women could be affected by the closure of these refuges. Will May ensure the cap on housing benefit does not apply to refuges. May says the government is working on exempting women’s refuges from the housing benefit cap. But the government has a very good record on domestic violence, she says. It is 50 days since she and Corbyn last met at the despatch box. It is good to see him sitting there. The Conservative government has been working tirelessly, she says. She mentions the public sector audit, and work on new trade deals. What a contrast with the party opposite, divided amongst themselves, and incapable of uniting the country. Corbyn says there is a housing crisis in Britain. Some £9.3bn is paid from housing benefit into the pockets of private landlords. Is that money well spent? May says Corbyn asked about home ownership, but than objects to a measure that helps people have homes. Corbyn may have an ideological objection to the private rented sector. Everything Corbyn tells us everything we need to know about Labour. The train has left the station, the leader is on the floor, even on rolling stock, they are a laughing stock. Corbyn says David Cameron said every penny spent on housing subsidies was money that could not be spent on new housing. He quotes someone saying landlords should be fined for renting homes in poor condition. Does the PM think this is satisfactory? May says, if housing benefit is such a bad thing, why did Labour oppose cuts to housing benefit. The rules for landlords have been changed, she says. New rules are being introduced for houses in multiple occupation. Jeremy Corbyn starts off also congratulating Team GB. The average house price is now £215,000. That is eight times the average wage. Isn’t the dream of home ownership now just a dream? May says it is important to help people get their first foot on the housing ladder. House building is up. But the government wants to do more, she says. Corbyn says house building is 45,000 a year less than under the last Labour government. He quotes from a note from Jenny. She and her partner work in a supermarket. They have been told they can borrow £73,000. So there is not much hope for them. George Osborne said there would be one to one replacement for homes sold under right to buy. But only one home gets build for every five homes sold. When will one to one replacement come in? May says Corbyn is wrong. The government has delivered on one to one replacement. Corbyn has asked his followers on Twitter for questions. May says she looked at them. He got on from Lewis saying don’t know scored higher than Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister. Whoever wins the Labour leadership, “we will not let them anywhere near power again”. Neil Parish, a Conservative, asks for an assurances that farmers will not lose out from Brexit. May says the chancellor’s announcement also said farmers would have their EU income guaranteed too until 2020. Thangam Debbonaire, the Labour MP, says the UK has a disproportionate number of the world’s best universities. But some are already losing out as a result of Brexit. Can May tells MPs what the government’s stragegy is? May welcomes Debbonaire back. (She was ill earlier this year.) She says the chancellor has announced that universities will have some EU funding guaranteed. Theresa May starts by congratulating the British Olympic team. They did themselves and their country proud, she says. And she offers best wishes to the Paralympic team. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. PMQs starts in 10 minutes. Here is the order paper showing which MPs are asking questions. Here is my colleague Alan Travis’s story on Liz Truss’s evidence to the justice committee. And here is how it starts Theresa May’s new government has pulled back from Michael Gove’s plan to introduce a major prison reform bill that formed the social reform centrepiece of David Cameron’s last Queen’s speech only four months ago. The new justice secretary, Liz Truss, sparked astonishment among MPs when she refused to guarantee to the Commons justice select committee that Gove’s prison reform legislation would go ahead. When asked by the justice committee chairman if the prison reform bill was going to go ahead, she replied: “We are looking at that at the moment. It will be in the plan … I am not committing to any specific piece of legislation at this stage.” Chuka Umunna, the Labour former shadow business secretary, will stand for election as chair of the Commons home affairs committee, I’m told. He is a member of the committee and all MPs will vote for the new chair following Keith Vaz’s resignation yesterday. Umunna has the backing of all Labour members of the committee, as well as some Tories on committee. As MP for Streatham in south London, where there is a sizeable black and minority ethnic (BME) community, he feels that chairing the committee would dovetail with his constituency responsibilities (because home affairs covers some issues of particular relevance to BME communities). He also thinks that having a serving member of the committee replace Vaz would provide continuity, which would benefit the committee, and that it would be good for Vaz to be replaced by a BME candidate because Vaz was the only BME Commons select committee chair. Home affairs is one of the most high-profile Commons committee and there is likely to be strong competition for the post, which has to got a Labour MP. Caroline Flint, a former Home Office minister, has already confirmed that she is also standing. Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign team have responded rather wittily to Owen Smith’s open letter about what he should say at PMQs. (See 10.17am.) Liz Truss, the new justice secretary, has just finished giving evidence to the Commons justice committee this morning. Here are some of the highlights. The tweets are from the Guardian’s Alan Travis, the BBC’s Danny Shaw and the legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg. Truss suggested that the prison and courts reform bill announced in the Queen’s speech earlier this year was no longer a priority. She refused to commit herself to cutting prison numbers. She said drug levels in prisons were being cut. Journalists and commentators watching the session were not impressed. These are from the Daily Mirror’s Jack Blanchard. This is from Politics Home’s Emilio Casalicchio And this is from the lawyer and legal blogger Carl Gardner. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, is today launching a Lib Dem “plan for Britain in Europe”. The party is campaigning for people to be given the chance to vote on the final Brexit deal, although it claims that this is not the same as demanding a second referendum. Farron said: Voting for departure is not the same as voting for a destination. Brexit means Brexit but we still don’t know if that means £350m a week extra for the NHS, immigration controls or membership of the Single Market. This is not an attempt to re-run the first referendum. It is to enable the public to vote on the final deal, reflecting that there is disagreement even in the cabinet over every major aspect of Brexit. David Willetts, the former Conservative universities minister who now chairs the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was on the Today programme this morning criticising the government’s proposal to bring back grammar schools. It’s a subject about which he feels strongly, because his opposition to grammar schools probably cost him a seat in cabinet. As shadow education secretary in 2007 he gave a speech saying bringing back grammar schools would be bad for social mobility. David Cameron backed him at the time, but the Willetts argument went down very badly with Conservative party members and Willetts was subsequently demoted to the shadow universities post. As universities minister he attended cabinet but not as a full cabinet minister. On the Today programme he said he had not changed his mind on grammar schools. It’s a very serious problem in these selective systems: they do tend to be captured by the better-informed, more affluent parents ... They’re doing the right thing for their kids but the trouble is social mobility suffers as a result. If you look overall, not just in Britain but around the world, at those school systems we admire that have got high performance and high standards, from Shanghai to Finland, by and large they don’t put their effort into trying to pick which kids they educate; they put their effort into raising standards for all the kids. Owen Smith, the Labour leadership challenger, has written an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn about the questions he should ask at PMQs. His suggestions are rather good. But they are contained in a letter that is both critical and patronising. Here’s a flavour of it. I’m sorry to say that in her first PMQs in July, you put Theresa May under no pressure at all. You moved from issue to issue with no follow-up for any of your six questions, so that the prime minister’s answers were not challenged. You didn’t even ask her about the EU, even though Brexit was and is the biggest challenge facing her government, and the reason for David Cameron’s resignation and her elevation to Downing Street. Perhaps the same reticence about standing up for Britain’s place in the EU which led you to campaign so ineffectively for Remain also puts you off exposing the weaknesses and contradictions in the Government’s position – but continuing to fail to take Theresa May on over Brexit would be a dereliction of duty. And here are the specific questions that Smith proposes. Following her experience at the G20 summit this weekend, does the PM regret not campaigning harder for Britain to remain in the EU? The PM has said on a number of occasions that “Brexit means Brexit”. Did she find that this vacuous slogan was sufficient to alleviate our allies’ concerns at the G20 this weekend, or did they still have some questions? The Japanese government raised a number of concerns about what Brexit might mean – they clearly do not find “Brexit means Brexit” a sufficient clarification of UK government policy. They want the UK to stay within the single market. But the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union says this is “improbable”. Does the PM agree with the Japanese Government or her own Secretary of State? President Obama said at the G20 that the USA’s priority would be to pursue trade deals with the EU and with Pacific countries – not to do a deal with the UK. Does the PM plan to persuade the United States to change its diplomatic priorities, and if so how? Over the last few months a points-based immigration system has been proposed by the Foreign Secretary, the International Trade Secretary, the International Development Secretary, the Environment Secretary and the Transport Secretary. Can the PM confirm that she disagrees with all of them? A points-based immigration system was one of the Leave campaign’s key promises. Can the PM confirm that she also has no intention of honouring the Leave campaign’s promise of an additional £350m a week for the NHS? The Smith letter was originally written for the Times’s Red Box website. Here are some more lines from the Today programme’s interview with Steven Ciobo, the Australian trade minister. Ciobo confirmed that Australia had offered to lend trade negotiators to the UK - although his tone suggested it was not a particularly serious offer. I indicated that if a request was forthcoming, Australia would certainly be willing to help. I made the passing quip to Secretary Fox that if we were going to have negotiations with Australia, they would probably go very smoothly if it was Australians on all sides of the negotiating table. But, ultimately, we’re happy to provide whatever support we can. Britain does not have trade negotiators because, as an EU member, all trade negotiations have been conducted on the UK’s behalf by Brussels. But since the Brexit vote Whitehall has been trying to recruit some. He said that cheap Australian wine would be one benefit of a UK-Australia trade deal. Asked if Australian wine would get cheaper for British consumers, he replied: Absolutely. Cheap Australian wine is a good fringe benefit of an FTA [free trade agreement] if we are able to put one in place. He confirmed that Australia would conclude its trade deal with the EU before concluding one with the UK. “That’s a consequence of the fact that discussions with the European Union are more advanced than they are with the UK,” he said. In July, a few days before his surprise appointment as Brexit secretary, David Davis wrote a detailed article for ConservativeHome about the approach the government should adopt to EU withdrawal. In it, he confidently predicted that new trade deals with countries outside the EU could be negotiated quickly, within two years. So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th [at this point the Tories still thought members would be voting in a lengthy leadership election[ to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months. So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU. But that timetable has timetable has now been consigned to the bin. Steven Ciobo, the Australian trade secretary, has come to London for talks with Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and in an interview with the BBC he said that it would take at least two and a half years to agree a UK-Australian trade deal, and possibly longer. That was because the two countries could not strike a deal until the UK left the EU, he said. My formal advice is that, and this is from the UK side, the UK is unable to negotiate or sign an agreement prior to the formal exit from the EU. We can certainly have preliminary discussions and that’s part of what I’m doing here this week. Preliminary discussions around what a post-Brexit Australia-UK trade deal might look like. Asked if that meant a deal was some years off, Ciobo replied: Based upon what we’ve been told, if article 50 is present in Q1 or Q2 next year [the first or second quarter of the year] and then the two year year window in relation to that, so you would expect it is at least two and a half years off. Ciobo was then asked if, with the UK and Australia only free to sign a deal in two and a half years’ time, there would then be months or years of “tough negotiations”. Ciobo conceded that at that point further talks might be necessary, but he also said that with “our strong historical bonds we should be able to make a meal of it quite quickly”. And remember - Australia is supposed to be one of the countries with whom negotiating a trade deal should be easiest. I will post more from the interview shortly. And we’ve got more Brexit later, because Theresa May is making a statement in the Commons about the G20 summit which is almost certain to turn into a mini debate about the government’s Brexit policy. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Liz Truss, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: May gives a statement to MPs. It is supposed to be about the G20 summit, but it is bound to lead to MPs questioning her about Brexit, which was discussed at the summit. 2.30pm: Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Heath, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. 3pm: Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and Priti Patel, the international development secretary, meet representatives of the Syrian opposition. 3pm: Amber Rudd, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 4pm: Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, launches his energy and environment policy. As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all.

EDF has signed a deal with the UK government to build two reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and analyst George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon said: EDF and the UK government's announcement that they have reached an agreement for an investment contract of the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will lead to a revenue uptick for Aveva. On 7 November Aveva announced that EDF has expanded its investment in Aveva technology by implementing additional engineering software products from the Aveva Plant portfolio. EDF began working with Aveva in the 1980s. Aveva shares are currently 20p higher at £26, but O'Connor added: We remain encouraged by the operational progress but the valuation – PE is 29.8 times – is likely to repel new buyers.

It describes the technology, which traps the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and buries it, as “vital to limit climate change”. The MPs on the energy and climate change select committee (ECC) sharply criticised the government's botched £1bn competition for the first plants, which launched in 2007 and had to be restarted in 2011, after the last competitor withdrew. Tim Yeo MP, chair of the ECC, said: “Fitting power stations with CCS is absolutely vital if we are to avoid dangerously destabilising the climate. After nearly a decade of delay, the Department of Energy and Climate Change has finally got near to delivering two pilot CCS projects in the UK. It must now fast-track these projects and reach final investment decisions before the election to ensure this technology can start delivering carbon savings by the 2020s.” If the pilot projects go ahead they will fit CCS to a gas-fired power station in Peterhead and to the coal-fired power station at Drax in Yorkshire. Yeo said the pilots would not be enough to kick-start the large CCS industry needed in the UK to cut carbon significantly and that other CCS projects must be made eligible for the guaranteed-price contracts being given to other low-carbon energy projects such as the proposed nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point and offshore wind farms. Yeo added: “The CCS ‘competition’ the government launched has turned out to be a model example of how not to support a fledgling industry.” The MPs said CCS was a vital technology because burning all existing fossil fuel reserves without capturing their emissions would drive global warming well above the 2C threshold that scientists describe as dangerous. The report said the UK was very well placed to become a world leader in CCS because of its access to the North Sea, where CO2 could be buried in exhausted oil and gas fields. The UK's engineering expertise and the cross-party commitment to cutting carbon also helped, it said. Energy minister Michael Fallon said: “The UK is ahead of the rest of Europe with two CCS projects actively undertaking detailed engineering studies ahead of full construction.\" He said CCS projects would be supported by long-term guaranteed-price contracts \"so it’s important we take the time to get our decisions right and follow a robust process\". But Tom Greatrex MP, Labour’s shadow energy minister, said: “The government attitude towards CCS has been one of damaging neglect. It appears to be uninterested in the enormous potential for CCS in the UK. In our efforts to decarbonise, CCS is not an option but a necessity.” Professor Stuart Haszeldine, director of the Scottish CCS research group, said: “We all want a secure future, which includes low-carbon energy. Developing five CCS projects now will cost each UK household around £30 per year. The UK needs more than 30 of these to start building before 2025. To avoid extra costs later, we must develop our CO2 storage now. That is a good insurance premium against the 100% certainty of future carbon taxes and future global change.” Nick Molho, at WWF-UK, said demonstrating the feasibility of CCS is an urgent priority for the government: “But the government shouldn’t plan significant investments in new fossil fuel plants today on the assumption that CCS technology will be available at an affordable cost in the future when we simply don’t know that yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/apr/10/monbiot-simon-nuclear-letter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-10T10:59:00Z","webTitle":"Emails between George Monbiot and Theo Simon on nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/10/monbiot-simon-nuclear-letter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/apr/10/monbiot-simon-nuclear-letter","fields":{"headline":"Emails between George Monbiot and Theo Simon on nuclear power","bodyText":"George Monbiot's original email to Theo Simon Dear Theo, I hope you are all thriving. I'm writing because I saw that you have been campaigning to prevent a replacement for the nuclear power station at Hinkley, and I think that is the wrong thing to do. It is true that we could replace all current power generation with renewables. But it would take longer and cost more than if we were to sustain nuclear power as part of the mix. As you know, we are already on the margins of possibility of avoiding more than two degrees of global warming. Replacing coal and gas in time to prevent runaway warming is a tough enough challenge for any country. Doing so at the same time as replacing nuclear power is nigh-on impossible. I hope you are aware of the dire news from Germany, in terms of the massive contribution to emissions the shutdown will make, despite Germany's efforts at efficiency and new investment in renewables: if not, you can follow the links in the article I've appended below. Now we see a similar disaster emerging in Japan, as it switches from this low-carbon option to coal and LNG: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/20/energy-japan-mof-idUSL4E8DK02G20120220 I admit that none of our options for generating electricity are good ones. I don't like nuclear power, and I would be happier if we could do without it, but I know that if we shut down the UK's nuclear plants and don't replace them, the gap will almost certainly be filled by coal and gas, greatly increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact it is quite likely to be filled by shale gas. Yes, we could and should cut total energy use. But should we cut it in order to help get rid of fossil fuels, or cut it to help get rid of nuclear power? We certainly can't do both by these means. Faced with a choice between the two options, there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that fossil fuel is the worst. I don't need to spell out to you the impacts of climate change, or of coal extraction, or of the local pollution associated with coal and to a lesser extent gas burning. Beside these the potential impacts of nuclear power are tiny. Coal kills more people when it goes right than nuclear power does when it goes wrong. In fact coal kills more people every week than nuclear power has in the entire history of its deployment. The uncomfortable fact is that the opponents of nuclear power (among whom I numbered until recently) have justified their position with levels of bullshit and junk science very similar to those used by the climate change deniers, and Stop Hinkley is no exception. When I wrote to Katy Attwater, expressing my concerns about the quality of the scientific evidence on their site, she told me \"I have no faith in the Scientific peer review process as it currently works.\" Just like James Delingpole, David Bellamy etc when it comes to climate science. I've attached our correspondence for you to see. I have to say it made my heart sink. Theo, we need you too much for the battles that need to be fought. God knows there are enough of them. But the inevitable result of this one, if it succeeds, will be to raise our greenhouse gas emissions, help threaten life on earth and compromise the life chances both of future generations and of people living now in countries poorer than our own. That is not what you or any of us began campaigning for. But as the results of both the German and Japanese experiments demonstrate, it's now clear that this will be the legacy of anti-nuclear campaigning. Please think again before you counteract all the good work you've done on other issues. With love from George Theo Simon's response to George Monbiot Hi George, and thank you for taking the time to write. I appreciate your commitment to getting our energy policy right and to bringing your friends along with you. For the benefit of others I have included your email to me at the end of mine. I was unable to receive and then easily respond to your mail after you sent it on Feb 21st as I was living at the Hinkley occupation camp, then preparing for a High Court case, and then dealing with the eviction and it's aftermath. However, I think this is a welcome opportunity to contrast our positions around nuclear new-build, so I am writing now. It's ironic that you wrote to me about my involvement in our Somerset campaign against the proposed Hinkley C at a time when we were trying so hard to raise national media awareness. Normally you would have been my journalist of choice for amplifying the story, as it has a lot of the elements you might have liked to get your teeth into: little people vs. big business; corruption of the planning process to favour corporate interests; democratic decisions prejudiced and mis-directed by government officials; lack of accountability and transparency; flagrant disregard for processes which protect our natural heritage; media monopolisation, and of course, bribery. But I didn't think you would want to champion this particular case because the outcome of the whole sorry process is set to be... a new nuclear power station! And since you have already decided, ahead of ongoing public consultation and the IPC examination now in progress, that Hinkley C must be built, any efforts to challenge or interrupt that process must therefore be \"the wrong thing\". I can give you the benefit of the doubt and guess that you aren't aware of the detailed issues here on the ground. Your legitimate pre-occupation with cutting CO2 emissions – which is in itself welcome – has led to the exclusion of other important concerns from your thinking about a new-nuclear future. The process in West Somerset has now brought those real-life concerns into sharp relief. Interestingly, some of the best and most supportive people who passed through our brief occupation camp were not anti-nuclear per se, and a few of them had been persuaded by your recent arguments. But they were people who value the democratic safeguards which limit corporate land-grabbing and environmental destruction in Britain – safeguards which the new planning process has now fatally undermined. From their point of view, what is happening at Hinkley is a test-bed for the whole \"fast-track\" planning regime and what it could mean for projects in other parts of Britain – road-builds, runways or any other project favoured by a government that justifies new-nuclear by its commitment to reducing carbon emissions (!) I don't want to pretend I hadn't already come down on the side of the antis when I joined the occupation. After some re-evaluation in the light of yours and Mark's recent articles, I had. Beguiling as your recent contributions about re-assessing danger levels, possible new designs for nuclear reactors or the need for strong regulation of the industry have been, experience on the ground in Stogursey Parish has only confirmed my suspicion as to what a \"nuclear renaissance\" will look like in reality. After a lengthy pre-application process, the IPC has just embarked on its final 6-month examination of the EDF application to build 2 new reactors at Hinkley point. After this period of hearings and written evidence, the panel of commissioners will make a recommendation and a secretary of state will make the final decision. Regardless of your own preference for nuclear, I assume you accept that for this process to be meaningful it must include the possibility that EDF's application will be rejected. If not, then you would have to accept that we now live in a planning dictatorship and that the whole IPC process is in fact a charade at public expense. But if we assume that the consultation is genuine, then clearly by any normal standards of fairness and objectivity it would be wrong for major construction to commence before the permission has been granted. But bizarrely that is exactly what has happened here in West Somerset. In the next month or so, apparently with a special licence to clear ground during the nesting season, EDF's contractors will commence the erasure of 400 acres of West Somerset coastland, including the habitats of red-list species, skylark breeding grounds, bat roosts and the little stand of West Quantocks oak woodland, not to mention a place of much archaeological interest and recreational amenity. All this will be demolished, felled, stripped and levelled before EDF have obtained planning permission to build. It's an unprecedented decision – and a terrifying precedent. First, get a National Policy statement in favour of your construction project – this means you can then rule out all further discussion about the project's technology, its impact on future generations, it's toxicity and safety, and whether we even need it. Even the people whose district it is going to be in may not consider these matters once it is a National Policy. Next, slice up your planning application into smaller bits. Apply to the District Council to start the earthworks – since it isn't structural it doesn't need to go to the IPC, and since the project before the IPC will be in line with National Policy anyway, you can probably assume it will get the go ahead and rip up those TPOs now. This has the advantage that the environmental impact will be irrelevant by the time they make their recommendation: it will have already happened. Rare habitats? – What rare habitats? The other advantage is that by the time it gets to the secretary of state the site in question will have been reduced to a series of bare platforms, ramps, pits and trenches – it will seem almost bloody-minded not to grant EDF permission to finish the job. Of course, there is a very real chance that they will pull out – as Eon and Npower have just done – for financial reasons (or even because of a change of government in the French elections). They may well pull out after the worst damage has been done. So in the case of Hinkley C you'll end up either with an expensive and carbon intensive trashed building site, or with 2 new nuclear reactors being installed, and a new pile of radioactive waste being prepared, without any consideration having been given to either the ecological impact of the construction or to the health and safety impacts of the process itself on local communities. As you yourself prophesied in a piece about the government's draft National Planning Policy Framework last year \"it will be almost impossible to resist development, however destructive or detrimental it might be....everything will be permitted unless there is a powerful reason why it should not be, and the powerful reasons have been ruled out in advance\". (Terra Nullius 5/7/11) The powerful reasons in this case were presented by a host of conservation, heritage and ecological bodies, parish councils and local residents. None of them believed for a minute that the damage could ever be ameliorated or repaired once the preparatory work had been done. EDF's pledges to do just that if the project falls through were described as \"ludicrous\". (Exactly how this restoration will be achieved is something that EDF have promised to work out later, once they have got the destruction under way). Nonetheless, most District Councillors decided to bow to the stick of National Policy, follow the carrot of local job creation and handouts, and turn a blind eye to the skylarks. The happy compliance of the West Somerset population with this development is an EDF myth however. The most common description I've heard of the process locally is \"steam-roller\". Most people I met in local villages while we camped there agreed with the argument we put – that either EDF's preparatory works are an obscene act of negligence, or the entire planning process is now a sham whose outcome is, as they say in Stogursey \"a done deal\". But if you want to build a nuclear power station, best build it where they've already got used to it. West Somerset is a community adapted by 40 years of experience to life in the shadow of a toxic industry, resigned to it's council-issued Potassium Iodide tablets, trying to make the best of a bad job. It's also a community where the dominance of the public space by EDF and the atom industry is so total it has the appearance of a company town. Several local rags would collapse if they now had to stop being EDF free-sheets. Locals are compromised, not only by the desperate fears over jobs – which of course could be provided for in many other ways too – but also by their dependency on EDF handouts, which are really a kind of corporate social bribe. One man told us he would like to come up to our camp, but he daren't be seen supporting us as he was a governor of a school set to receive several grand from the developer. In this way, cuts in the social budget lay the way open for a corporation to become an indispensable benefactor to a community. The people of Stogursey are left cowed, muted and confused. \"Don't tell anyone else in the village I was here\" says the woman who brings us a generator to charge batteries. I tell her that's what they all say. They secretly wish us well, but they've given up. The best they can hope for is the little concessions they can wring out of EDF. Rumours of corruption and manipulation abound, but no one wants to go public. It's that strange atmosphere of fear and paranoia that always seems to hover around the nuclear industry. It hovers around the faceless, box-ticking, bullying EDF as well. Of course, as you pointed out in your piece \"Corporate Power? No Thanks!\" last July, and as I discovered at the Vestas wind turbine factory occupation – and even in dispute with the BBC - heartless manipulation is a quality shared by most corporations. Although you candidly admitted that \"… In most parts of the world the nuclear operators remain secretive, unaccountable and far too close to government\" you went on to conclude that \"There is no contradiction between favouring the machines and opposing the machinations\". But I think you miss an essential point about the nuclear machine here: it's not just its history as \"a by-product of nuclear weapons research\" that has left it with a few old creases we need to iron out. Its guardedness arises implicitly from the technology itself. Because it is a prime target for terror, a prime source for lethal military material, and so potentially hazardous that all activity around it must be tightly and carefully controlled, it is a process that demands impenetrable security, armed policing and authorised-only access. The paradox is that, as one of the most uniquely toxic industrial processes we have ever developed, the greater good requires that there is total public scrutiny of its affairs - but the world is not safe enough for that, so we must rely on unaccountable self-regulation instead. Now give a manipulative, greedy corporation a financial interest in that process and watch what happens. Here is EDF being handed a prime piece of our natural heritage on an NPS plate; here is David Cameron's office cajoling District Councillors to pressure a recalcitrant land-owner into selling her land: here is the County evacuations officer, the aptly named Mr Hurry, visiting our camp to hand out EDF corporate calendars with the Potassium Iodide tablets; and here are the legal papers served on our camp with evidence supplied to EDF by the District Council Press Officer. (Oh yes, and here are EDF extending their Licensed Nuclear Site boundary without permission from the ONR, just so they can deter protesters). I think before you demand solemnly, (but to be honest irrelevantly in terms of the influence you wield), that \"A new generation of nuclear power stations should be built only with unprecedented scrutiny and transparency\" (ibid) you need to take a reality check. It's not happening here in Somerset. Our nuclear furnaces are being built and will be administered by a suited snake-tongued gang of legal weasels who even the Somerset and Avon Constabulary have come to despise. But that's ok; they'll have their own police force won't they? - The Civil Nuclear Constabulary, soon to be merged with the MOD police. \"It is through such collusion that accidents happen\". You said it. But it's not just through collusion. Accidents happen anyway. They just do. I'd love you to have a head to head with a technical expert like the retired high-ranking Hinkley B engineer who came to our camp. From a far deeper knowledge base than mine or yours he'd explain the shortcomings of the EPR design, and tell you how contractors driven by deadlines and financial pressures inevitably build mistakes into complex systems. Actually you could chat with any ex-workers, from this or any other large hazardous industrial process, and get all the hair-raising insights you need into the inevitable foibles of human behaviour, compounded by the capitalist bottom line, which make some processes just too risky to pursue. I see that Mark (Lynas) has been using the term \"green luddite\" about people like me – a compliment I am not worthy to bear having never risked either a soldiers bullets, state execution or life-exile as they did for their cause. But this is an appropriate time to recall the words of one such Ludd, 200 years ago this year, that we must \"put down all machinery injurious to the commonality\". We don't need to pick nuclear up. We know it is one of the most hazardous industrial processes we have yet stumbled upon and that the waste product will remain hazardous into future generations. Just the imposed and non-negotiable responsibility for looking after that nuclear fire once we've lit it will be injurious to them. So also, on an emotional level I think, will be the knowledge that their ancestors just couldn't be arsed to get more creative with meeting our energy needs than leaving them to pick up the tab. In the meantime we have to hope that it won't turn out \"injurious\" to us. I do understand of course that, in the light of it's climate changing effect, releasing CO2 through burning fossil fuels is \"injurious to the commonality\" on another scale altogether. I have campaigned for 2 decades on cutting emissions. But if it turned out that asbestos dust had a temperature decreasing quality I still wouldn't favour spraying it in the air. Other elements haven't suddenly become less toxic to humans because of climate change. There is a constant pressure in capitalism for lowering toxicity thresholds, which makes the current green revisionism promoted by people like Mark very welcome in some quarters. But we should defend lines drawn in public and environmental safety as gains in our evolution towards a rational society. In my opinion, the boundaries drawn around my behaviour by the duty of care and the precautionary principle that stems from it are in line with the biological interests of my species and with maintaining the integrity of the biosphere. In other words they are as inviolable as the 7 planetary boundaries identified by the Stockholm Resilience Centre (and used by Mark in \"The God Species\" as the springboard for his own reactionary ideas). That means I have to create ways to live within them and still thrive. That means, like it or lump it, I'm going to have to do it without nuclear. As far as I can tell, you don't think that's impossible, but you have given up hope that it's feasible or likely in the time-frame you believe is necessary. That has put you in the contradictory position of on the one hand decrying the existing \"monstrous pile of nuclear waste\" (Nuclear vs nuclear vs nuclear, 2/2/12) and on the other calling on me to stop opposing the Hinkley C development so that they can make another monstrous pile of fresh hot waste which will need to be stored undisturbed on the edge of the sea for several centuries at least. You have explained several times now that you favour the deployment of new nuclear reactors which you believe could consume the existing waste legacy as fuel. Some people question the feasibility of this technology and I don't know enough to comment on it, but I would encourage you to continue this line of research, as a supportable method for dealing with our toxic legacy is still needed. But good or bad, this is not the technology on offer at Hinkley C. What we are opposing here is the same old waste pile, the same old lengthy and expensive decommissioning, the same old secrecy and state collusion, the same old \"off site emergency\" hazard, and potentially the same old thyroid cancer for my daughter, 25 miles away. It only looks different because it has been re-invigorated by the fear of climate-change, modern propaganda techniques, the ageing of the anti-nuclear generation, and the lack of any democratic platform for opposing specific plans on the ground. It has also been aided by environmental authors like yourself whose public promotions of nuclear have disorientated and disheartened the green movement and the left, while finding a willing audience among the broader middle-class who welcome a chance to salve their guilt about energy-intensive lifestyles with the re-assuring news that \"apparently nuclear's ok now, and it's the only way to solve climate change\". I know that isn't the pure message you wanted to convey. But what we write, just like the technology we devise, has a political and social context which determines how it will be used and by whom. You advocate an \"energy mix\", (as do the energy investors with broad portfolios), which in Britain includes 10 new nuclear power stations. You believe that if we don't take that course then the money will go into carbon burning, not a renewables revolution, energy efficiencies, reduction of waste and false needs and a massive investment in R&amp;D for alternative energy production. But that's a political decision. The renewables revolution route is one which had growing social traction after COP15 and still does, even in the hostile environment of public spending cuts and a triumphalist nuclear lobby. If we do not choose nuclear AND we drive rigourously to meet carbon reduction targets, that will simply apply more pressure on the renewables sector and other innovators to deliver. Partly this can be market-driven, and the diversity of the sector makes brilliant creative innovations far more likely than they are in the monolithic nuclear industry. But it will only be possible with massive public investment and direction, and that raises the unavoidable issue of who is controlling the wealth and resources. At COP15 I concluded that capitalism (yes Mark, I'm an unashamed anti-capitalist!) could not respond effectively to the challenge of climate change, because it's primary motive will always be profit and competitive advantage, even where planetary well-being is concerned. At the very least, a large degree of state intervention and socialised initiatives are needed, and this in turn requires a big degree of political control being exerted over capital, which may or may not be possible. It's that uncertainty which is the difficult bit. I don't think that you believe we can find the political will or the social base for a meaningful green revolution to occur in time to reduce UK emissions by other means than re-embracing nuclear. I also think that you have forgotten that you yourself are a subjective factor in determining the political landscape, as am I. What is necessary is to encourage and empower a left democratic social movement which is steeped in ecological understanding. Your current commitment to nuclear in Britain cuts across that agenda, and to paraphrase your email to me, potentially undoes all your other good work. Each time you write something like \"I don't like nuclear power, but…\" it sounds like defeatism. It sounds like you have decided it's better to run with a toxic solution that doesn't challenge the existing social order than to wait for a social movement with real political power to develop. I can really understand that perspective. My dad reluctantly held it at the end of his life even though he spent the eighties resisting Hinkley C. But I think it's wrong. In order to get through our evolutionary crisis in any meaningful way, we need optimistic, life-affirming, movement-building messages right now. We need more than ever to champion a vision of the kind of creativity which a democratic revolution would rapidly liberate. Nuclear entrenches power firmly in the hands of a state-protected, unaccountable and ruthless elite of technocrats and power-brokers, at a time when the urge of young humanity is towards transparency, openness and democracy. It can give no ultimate assurance of it's safety or it's costs. Neither can it demonstrate the kind of long-term resilience which may prove necessary if runaway climate change does, in spite of our efforts, develop. Resilience is to my mind something which we should be designing into our energy production plans now, as the future is so uncertain for our children. Nuclear requires a stable and continuous technocratic society to exist for centuries. I imagine that when you contemplate runaway climate change - running so rapidly towards us - your feelings are similar to that dreaded nuclear terror which haunted so many people in the early eighties. That fight forged many of our political identities, and ended with a false dawn of hope that the nuclear genie was being backed back into it's bottle – that nuclear weapons would diminish and we were turning our backs on the toxic technology of the nuclear furnace for good. So you can't really be surprised – or even dismayed - that so many people respond emotively to your propagandising for nuclear. From their point of view you seem to have become a one-man pro-bono PR Company! In the letter you just co-authored to Cameron you suggest that nuclear would be a lot cheaper and better by now if Porrit and FOE etc hadn't \"devoted decades\" to fighting it. Well they did. Lots of people did. Personally I'm proud of it, even if I regret that our political naivety, coupled with the defeat of working-class representation in that decade, meant that capitalism and it's appetites continued unabated. If we had moved in a more rational direction back then, renewables and other energy options could also have been a lot further developed by now, and the fabled \"energy gap\", which you say we need nuclear to fill, might look a lot smaller. We are currently, on this issue, political opponents, and it pains me. While preparing for our eviction from Langborough Barn by EDF bailiffs I heard you on the radio discussing the London Occupy eviction which had happened the night before. As I would expect of you, you were championing the spirit of liberty, egality, and fraternity, and explaining the need for grass-roots democracy to hold the elites of capital to account. I'm afraid this position cannot honestly co-exist with your apparent support for the EDF, the IPC and the National Policy frameworks of the Tory coalition. When Cameron did his good-news-for-growth photo-op with Sarkozy he announced, with all the vote-rigging confidence of a third world dictator, that \"Hinkley C will be built\". In a Guardian piece celebrating the deal, Mark mentioned \"a small number of \"environmentalist\" protesters (eight at the last count)\" at Hinkley, of which I was one. His inverted commas around the word environmentalist were bizarre, but telling. Defending the land and it's biodiverse inhabitants against major destruction arising from flagrant abuses of the planning system is still the work of earthbound environmentalists, as I'm sure you agree. I expect you to support me in that work, and to condemn the current travesty of a democratic process which is unfolding in West Somerset. I also hope that you will draw a clearer public line between the reactor technology you support and the kind which will leave yet more hazardous waste for our respective children, and their children, and their children, to take care of. The latter is what we are being promised in West Somerset, and I will continue to do all in my power to prevent it, until I have either demonstrably failed in the attempt, or been persuaded otherwise. When you have the time I'd be very interested to hear your response to my thoughts. I have cced this mail to others in the movement who I think may find our discussion interesting.

With rising prices, tough carbon-reduction targets, and mounting political uncertainty ahead of the next election, energy has become a critical issue for government, business and civil society. But what impact is this having on voters? According to recent research carried out by Harris Interactive for the Guardian’s Big Energy Debate series – a year-long project analysing the energy crisis, and how it might be solved – just 2% of voters mention energy as one of the most important issues facing the UK. Despite the fact that 81% of those surveyed said they were concerned about the rising cost of heating their home, less than a third (32%) said that would influence how they vote. Given the amount of time and effort going into reforming the UK’s energy market, this needs to be addressed by politicians trying to solve one of the country’s major political and social issues: the “energy trilemma”. This term was coined by the World Energy Council to describe the problem of finding secure energy supplies and meeting rising demand, while keeping prices affordable and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The stakes are high: the UK is committed to meeting tough EU carbon-reduction targets and the “big six” energy companies are under intense scrutiny from government and consumer groups campaigning against rising prices. An interim report recently released by the Competition and Markets Authority made clear its concern about these major utilities’ opaque pricing and market dominance. “We are looking to identify the underlying causes, at both wholesale and retail level, which could be leading to the widespread concerns that have surrounded the energy market in recent years – including rising energy bills, service quality, profitability and uncertainty over future investment,” said Roger Witcomb, chairman of the CMA energy market investigation group. No shortage of ideas Policies and proposals to improve our green energy credentials are being published thick and fast. Although an amendment requiring almost total decarbonisation of the industry was narrowly defeated in the Commons last year – and more recently in the Lords – its author, Tim Yeo MP, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, said he took “a lot of encouragement” from the “relatively demanding” fourth carbon budget that has just been confirmed in the face of opposition from the chancellor, George Osborne. This means the UK will need to achieve a 50% cut in emissions on 1990 levels averaged across 2023-2027 – a binding target that is the most ambitious among the world’s developed countries. Achieving those cuts in emissions will now be harder to do, say renewable energy companies, given the £200m cap on subsidies for low-carbon technologies, also announced in July. But this cut fails to take into account public sentiment; over half of those surveyed by Harris Interactive said they backed subsidies for renewables. Paul Thompson, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, notes that the new policy, rather than supporting this, seems to indicate “a willingness to spend very large amounts on things like nuclear, which are expensive, and very small amounts on things like renewables, which are cheaper. So it’s now the cheaper technologies that are having to scrap for the cash.” Energy used to be one of the UK’s success stories in the days of abundant oil, gas and coal supplies. But as reserves have dwindled, attention has turned to renewable energy. Harris’s survey shows the public giving considerable support to solar power, with fully three quarters backing it. Tidal and marine, and hydro-electric came were supported by 69% and 70% respectively. Nuclear (35%), biomass (34%) and coal (25%) were least popular. While 40% of those surveyed said they had no opinion on fracking, 38% were opposed. Yet half of the survey sample said they would support both offshore and onshore wind projects being developed within five miles of their home. Votes and vetoes The public’s assessment may be politically important come the election and beyond. Practically, however, it’s not clear that government policies will have the desired effect of decarbonising the industry at the same time as reducing bills. “All the rules and incentives support the current system,” says Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy policy at Exeter university, which hampers any attempts at radical reform. “Electricity market reform has just been a vehicle to support nuclear power,” she says, “so, if anything, it’s reinforced the old system; it’s not about making the system more flexible and nimble and welcoming new practices. And the point is, customers pay for that.” Whatever we decide on in terms of our reliance on renewables, says Energy UK’s chief executive Angela Knight, the intermittency of solar, wind and other green sources means that “the more we invest in renewables, the more standby capacity we will need.” Because the only electricity capacity that can be turned on and off at will is gas-fired, says Knight, for every gigawatt of renewable capacity “we need the same amount of gas-fired.” More broadly, we need to think creatively about how to use less. “We’ve never looked at the reduction side, or not properly,” she says. “So it’s time we really had a good think about how much we use, and industry and households need to do that.” Read more stories like this: Energy policy too focused on redundant utility business models Why Middle East conflict is a bigger threat to UK energy security than Putin This article is part of the Guardian’s #bigenergydebate series.

Employees, local communities and regional councils are to be offered stakes in RWE projects as the company retreats in the face of its own huge debts, a plunging share price, and uncertain government policies. RWE, whose npower retail arm is one of the UK's big six power suppliers, has already shelved what would have been one of the world's largest offshore wind farms, the Atlantic Array, among other businesses. Paul Coffey, the chief operating officer of RWE npower Renewables, said his company was still committed to a pipeline of green power projects in Britain but admitted the era of his German-owned company taking majority stakes in future big offshore wind farms was probably over. RWE is already considering whether to reduce its involvement in the proposed Galloper offshore wind farm off the Suffolk coast from 50% to 25% and said this sort of move was likely to become more common. \"I would never say never ... (but) there are more drivers to taking smaller stakes rather than larger ones,\" he said, adding that the company was now focusing on \"value not volume\". The RWE executive, whose firm already owns major offshore wind farms such as Greater Gabbard and Gwynt y Mor, was unwilling to spell out the exact scale of the spending cuts, saying they would be made public on 4 March when the global renewable energy business - RWE Innogy - gives its annual briefing. Last year, RWE announced it would be halving the group's overall clean-tech spending planned for 2014 from €1bn (£830m) to €500m and the new figure for this year will be lower still. In 2013, £500m of the total spend went to the UK but the figure is expected to fall to around £300m now, some believe. The parent group is suffering under debts of €30bn on the back of plunging European electricity prices and the German government's decision to force the early closure of local nuclear power stations. RWE admitted that continuing uncertainty and problems with the UK government's much-delayed Electricity Market Reform programme was also influencing the spending cutbacks. Julia Lynch Williams, the UK managing director of RWE npower Renewables, who sits on a host of government working groups, said the electricity market reform programme \"has got to be concluded soon\" but also stressed that \"we need some improvements\" to its provisions. Meanwhile, the company expects to sell half of its 700MW of onshore wind development pipeline in the next few years and is considering an option to sell its £200m Markinch biomass plant in Fife, Scotland, which is just about to come online. It is claimed to be the largest biomass combined heat and power plant in the UK. RWE has already shut down a coal-fired plant that it developed into biomass at Tilbury on the Thames due to a lack of expected government financial support. The utility has also disposed of a £218m stake in a power supply business, its £350m stake in the Horizon nuclear power venture, and is searching for a buyer for its DEA oil exploration arm, operator of 13 productive gasfields in the North Sea. The company says it wants to move further to a \"capital light\" position where it is bringing in a range of outside investors and partners to help with its many schemes. RWE has already undertaken trials in Germany of selling stakes in the Jüchen onshore wind project, located in North Rhine-Westphalia, to its own staff and even local authorities.

It is already exploring partnerships with community ownership in relation to new onshore wind farms in Wales and Scotland on Forestry Commission sites. \"It's certainly of interest to us,\" said RWE npower Renewables' Lynch Williams. \"We want to be a trusted partner,\" said Coffey, whose business is dropping the \"npower\" part of the name - something he insists is unassociated with that particular business's image problems.

Prof Sachs said atomic energy was needed because it provided a low-carbon source of power, while renewable energy was not making up enough of the world's energy mix and new technologies such as carbon capture and storage were not progressing fast enough. \"We won't meet the carbon targets if nuclear is taken off the table,\" he said. He said coal was likely to continue to be cheaper than renewables and other low-carbon forms of energy, unless the effects of the climate were taken into account. \"Fossil fuel prices will remain low enough to wreck [low-carbon energy] unless you have incentives and [carbon] pricing,\" he told the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Manila. A group of four prominent UK environmentalists, including Jonathon Porritt and former heads of Friends of the Earth UK Tony Juniper and Charles Secrett, have been campaigning against nuclear power in recent weeks, arguing that it is unnecessary, dangerous and too expensive. Porritt told the Guardian: \"It [nuclear power] cannot possibly deliver – primarily for economic reasons. Nuclear reactors are massively expensive. They take a long time to build. And even when they're up and running, they're nothing like as reliable as the industry would have us believe.\" But Sachs, director of the Earth Institute and professor of sustainable development at Columbia University in the US, said the world had no choice because the threat of climate change had grown so grave. He said greenhouse gas emissions, which have continued to rise despite the financial crisis and deep recession in the developed world, were \"nowhere near\" falling to the level that would be needed to avert dangerous climate change. He said: \"Emissions per unit of energy need to fall by a factor of six. That means electrifying everything that can be electrified and then making electricity largely carbon-free. It requires renewable energy, nuclear and carbon capture and storage – these are all very big challenges. We need to understand the scale of the challenge.\" Sachs warned that \"nice projects\" around the world involving renewable power or energy efficiency would not be enough to stave off the catastrophic effects of global warming – a wholesale change and overhaul of the world's energy systems and economy would be needed if the world is to hold carbon emissions to 450 parts per million of the atmosphere – a level that in itself may be inadequate. \"We are nowhere close to that – as wishful thinking and corporate lobbies are much more powerful than the arithmetic of climate scientists,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/oct/10/challenge-narrative-possessions-equal-prosperity","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-10T14:25:07Z","webTitle":"Challenging the old narrative that possessions equal prosperity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/10/challenge-narrative-possessions-equal-prosperity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/10/challenge-narrative-possessions-equal-prosperity","fields":{"headline":"Challenging the old narrative that possessions equal prosperity","bodyText":"Prosperity. Every segment of society seeks it, but ask what it means or how to get it and the answers are not always clear. Do possessions equal prosperity? The mavens of Madison Avenue tell us: “He who dies with the most toys wins.” So we measure self-worth by what we buy, going deeper in debt to project the perception of plenitude. A New Yorker cartoon portrays a woman in an elegant boutique asking whether they have something to, “Fill that dark empty space in my soul.” As Dana Meadows observed, we seek to meet non-material needs with things. It’ll never work. Worse, we’ve allowed the ad industry to induce the impression that in the absence of whatever they’re selling, we’re inadequate. To play this game, you need money. The siren song is work harder, and you too, can join the moneyed class. It’s seductive: we all know someone who did win: the entrepreneur who struck it rich, hard-working immigrants who scrimped to put the kids through college, clawing their way to the middle class. But Thomas Piketty’s book Capital in the 21st Century shows the system is rigged. Working harder won’t ensure prosperity. Without transformation of the financial system, the neoliberal ideology that has imposed austerity around the planet is punishing everyone who is not an owner of capital. GDP and prosperity Such a situation is fragile. After 9/11, George W Bush famously implored a panicked public to go shopping. Not for therapy, but because his advisers rightly reckoned that an economy built on consumption acting as if no shock has happened will achieve precisely that economic impact – no contraction. At all costs, keep Wall Street prosperous. So governments bailed out the banks, the 10 biggest of which are bigger now than they were before 2008, as most of the world’s people live on the edge, further from prosperity. Despite its creator, Simon Kuznets, warning that it could never measure anything beyond the velocity of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), the international metric for wellbeing, counts increased flow through the economy of money and stuff as better. But that’s clearly wrong. Spending money may increase GDP, but not necessarily wellbeing. Robert F Kennedy observed in 1965: “Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising ... ambulances to clear our highways of carnage ... locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them ... destruction of the Redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. “It counts napalm, nuclear warheads and armoured cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play ... beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages ... It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile”. Employment and prosperity Politicians cling to growth because historically it tracked to job creation and prosperity depends on having a job. The new political currency, job creation, justifies any expenditure. But can enough jobs deliver shared prosperity? Automation, structural changes in the economy and the jobless recovery suggest not. Can new jobs even pay enough? Wal-Mart got a black eye for putting boxes in stores for its own underpaid associates to donate food so the least-well off of its employees might have a Thanksgiving supper. Slammed in the media for tone-deafness, Wal-Mart’s same store sales have been dropping, despite its prior success with green initiatives. In contrast, Costco takes care of its employees, paying a living wage so that they are able to buy their own supper, and has rising same-store sales year on year. What we really need is not a job but an assured livelihood. Some European countries discuss whether a minimum living should be considered a basic human right. Opponents ask how to pay for it – by which they really mean how do we keep people from becoming lazy slackers? A financial transaction tax or Peter Barnes’ tax and dividend approach to limit carbon emissions could generate the funds. How might people create meaning in their lives if they do not have to define themselves by the job that they do? Interesting trends, such as a rejection of home and car ownership, suggest there’s greater hunger for meaning and relationships in life than for accumulation of stuff. Millennials’s preference for their mobile phone over the keys to a car reflects a bundle of choices that are both encouraging and scary: a shift in consumer preferences to the sharing economy is key to buying time to deal with looming resource shortages, but could spell disaster for many industries: the rise of Uber and Lift have taxi companies mounting campaigns to get them banned as they offer their customers a viable alternative. But customers love such services, and are using them to transform their lives. Airbnb founder Joe Gebbia proudly describes how his “hosts’” choice to share unused space with strangers can allow them to quit hated jobs, celebrating a trust economy that underpins his entrepreneurial success. The changing face of prosperity This is not only a western phenomenon. Dr Hiroshi Komiyama, chair of Mitsubishi research, has shown that demand for consumer goods is saturating in Japan. People have what they want, so buy less. Japan’s no-growth society, far from stagnation has delivered rising happiness, at least until Fukushima. The current, neoliberal government, however, is trying to reverse the clock, grow the economy and reopen nuclear power plants, but it remains to be seen if that’s what the people want. Dr Nan Zhou of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory described a similar phenomenon in China, as well as how energy efficiency and increasing use of renewable energy can not only deal with looming energy shortages but clean up China’s deadly air and combat climate change. These are but a few examples of a new narrative of what it means to be prosperous – what Scandinavians call “lagom” - having enough. A new narrative is emerging from New Economics Foundation, Capital Institute, New Economy Coalition, the Club of Rome and the Alliance for Sustainability and Prosperity of an economy that will deliver prosperity for 100% of humanity – an economy in service to life.

Seven years of alarmism have yielded endless conferences and gargantuan sums of public expenditure, with no serious impact on carbon emissions. In a bitter irony, the state that has been most hostile to the concept, America, has been the leader in emissions reduction, largely through a free market shift from coal to gas. Today's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change should silence those who believe there is no debate to be had. On even the mildest precautionary principle, policymakers should take note of the shifts – whether temporary or lasting – in the composition of the earth's atmosphere. They are told to look with their own eyes at specific impacts, from glaciation to crop and fish yields. Sceptics may challenge some of these, but the balance of probability is clear. Something is happening that will matter to most of the world's inhabitants. At this point, many of the old obstacles arise. Powerful, debate-distorting lobbies have developed behind the huge sums of money at stake on either side. Where this report is helpful is in pluralising that debate away from mere alarmism – wasted on costly and often futile spending on \"renewables\" – towards thinking intelligently about how the world should adapt to what is already happening. If Rome is burning, there is no point in endlessly retuning Nero's fiddle. As Chris Field, one of the authors, points out, science now offers \"a clearer understanding of what we can and cannot achieve through mitigation and adaptation together\". Needless to say that does not wholly avert controversy. The author of the economic chapter, Britain's Richard Tol, asked for his name to be removed as the final draft proved more alarmist than what he had seen, especially in downplaying adaptation. Just as change harms some crops, he says, it aids others. \"Farmers adapt. They are not stupid,\" he says. \"It is pretty damn obvious that there are positive impacts of climate change, even though we are not always allowed to talk about them.\" Clearly the old dogmatism still curses this debate, but it does seem that the dam of orthodoxy is cracking. No interest group or lobby, no argument or scepticism, can be off the agenda. Climate change must invade territory that has proved anathema to many of its more virulent champions. This may have to involve defence and aid expenditure, nuclear power, GM foods, gas fracking, water management, migration, energy and farm subsidies. If climate change is as critical as the scientists claim, there can be no sacred cows. Nothing can be off limits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/18/windfarms-are-they-a-wonder-or-a-blight","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-18T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Windfarm wars: are they a majestic man-made wonder – or a blight on the countryside?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/18/windfarms-are-they-a-wonder-or-a-blight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/18/windfarms-are-they-a-wonder-or-a-blight","fields":{"headline":"Windfarm wars: are they a majestic man-made wonder – or a blight on the countryside?","bodyText":"The village of Redwick lies on the outskirts of Newport, a small, pretty run of houses whose position on the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels serves as a reminder of the force of both humans and environment: on the horizon lies the city’s docks, while a scratchpost at the ancient parish church is marked with a reminder of just how high the waters rose in the Bristol Channel flood of 1607. A year and a half ago, the village’s skyline shifted once again, when Newport council granted permission to Renewable Energy Systems (RES) to construct a wind turbine about 1.5km north-west of Redwick – an addition to the two turbines installed in 2011 at the nearby Tesco distribution centre. The Longlands Lane wind turbine was erected on 29 November last year, and generated its first electricity within a month. It is hoped it will be capable of providing enough electricity to meet the needs of around 800 homes. The turbine stands 100m tall, a slender, white steel pole with three graceful blades. In the quickening evening light it looks, to my eye, rather beautiful. As a city dweller I am, of course, accustomed to towering constructions, to the frequent disturbances of the skyline, to symbols of fierce modernity placed next to buildings of historical significance, and nature’s determined route around them both. I feel excited and reassured by this emblem of renewable energy before me, and from an aesthetic perspective I find wind turbines wonderful, especially en masse. The sight of a windfarm or a single turbine makes my heart lift. But beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, and my appraisal of the Longlands Lane turbine on a warm spring evening is not likely to echo that of locals who once knew and loved the empty sky it now fills. It is also a matter of how we perceive the relationship between man and nature – whether we regard the natural world as the aesthetic norm, something pristine upon which humanity and our technological “advances” intrude. Until now, this disagreement has mostly been abstract: if I think a windfarm is beautiful and someone else thinks it is ugly, there are few consequences. Either way, they still get built: not far away in Neath, a 76-turbine windfarm is under construction, and earlier this year the energy secretary, Ed Davey, opened England’s biggest onshore windfarm at Keadby in Lincolnshire. But now it looks as if that might change. In the Conservatives’ manifesto, they made concrete a proposal that was floated last year: there will be no more public subsidy for onshore windfarms, and they will “change the law so that local people have the final say on windfarm applications”. There are all sorts of arguments to be made about the rationale for this, but that final clause seems to hint at the one that, finally, holds sway: people who live near them hate the way they look, and more often than not, they want them gone. This is not a small decision. Halting the growth of onshore wind power would have various implications, both immediate and long-term – the industry provided £1.6bn of investment to the UK last year and employs 19,000 people, expected to rise to 30,000 during the next decade. Wind power is also regarded as a viable form of renewable energy in the UK; an alternative to fossil fuels, nuclear power and fracking. The UK is now the sixth-largest producer of wind power: at the start of this year its 5,958 turbines had a total installed capacity of 12 gigawatts – nearly eight of which comes from onshore turbines. Yet somehow the aesthetic argument holds sway. In 2006, a philosopher called Justin Good wrote an essay taking issue with such objections. Fine, the turbine might not be beautiful out of context, he said. But its usefulness made it beautiful, he went on: “There is a deeply intuitive connection between beauty, function and purpose, especially when we are thinking about the beauty of nature.” There are more practical objections to the change, too. “Failure by the next government to harness the full potential of onshore wind and ensure new projects are built would be bad news for UK voters and bill payers,” argues Rachel Ruffle, UK development director at RES. “It would cost hundreds of millions of pounds every year on more expensive energy technologies.” Plus, she says, there are benefits for villages such as Redwick that install turbines: “Onshore windfarms bring significant investment into local communities – on top of this RES windfarms offer an annual discount off the electricity bills of the nearest properties. And with 70% of the public supporting onshore wind power, in whose interest is it to prevent well-located windfarms being built?” Be that as it may, wind turbines frequently inspire a special kind of wrath, especially in communities faced with the prospect of seeing them built on their doorsteps. Certainly the Longlands Lane turbine was not without its objectors. In July 2012 RES began a process of public consultation, sending newsletters to 7,852 properties, placing advertisements in the local press and holding public briefings – though it is worth noting that a public exhibition was attended by just 1% of those directly invited. Still, concerns were voiced by environmental campaigners about the possible effects on birds and bats, residents worried about noise, the shadow flicker that occurs when the blades turn, and the visual impact on a landscape that is low-lying and largely rural. Martyn Kellaway is the conservative councillor for the Llanwern ward, which encompasses Redwick and the area where Tesco’s turbines were built. “I opposed the turbines because I represent the communities where those turbines sat, and it tends to be the villages that bear the most impact,” he says. “They are a blight. And that’s what the people I represent feel.” There are, he adds, more applications to build wind turbines in the area arriving all the time. “The Welsh government favours renewable energy in the form of these wind turbines,” he says. “But realistically they’ve got a lifespan of 20 years, and there’s no evidence that they’re worth it. What they ought to be doing instead is subsidising solar panels for houses, so households can benefit directly instead of this act of rural vandalism that has ruined the countryside.” His ward, he says, is inappropriate for turbine construction. “It’s flat here,” he says, “and the impact is greater than electricity pylons – pylons are stationary, they don’t move, they’re transparent, they don’t have lights on to warn aeroplanes; you can’t see them. They’re a totally different proposition.” Glynis Williams, a retired legal secretary and former clerk for Redwick community council agrees. “I was not happy at all when it was proposed, and I’m even less happy about it now,” she says. “I look out of my window and I can see three of them – especially at this time of year when there aren’t any leaves on the trees.” Williams refers to the towers as “monstrous” and says they have “desecrated the village, which is in a conservation area. We live on the Gwent Levels, which is completely flat, it’s a site of special scientific interest, and very beautiful, and they plonk three turbines on there.” She describes the inescapable dominance they exert over the landscape: “You come off the motorway and as you drive along the main road, it’s in front of you on the horizon, and then because of the lie of the land, it’s suddenly on your left. It’s very strange.” From the start, the turbine plans were not popular, she says: “I don’t think many people in the village wanted it. I know the community council wrote objections to it, because I was still clerk then.” The planners, she says “blithely ignored all local opposition”. She would rather the money were rather spent on the Severn barrage, “which would produce far more energy than wind power, not least because it would harness the huge 12-hourly tides”. It is feasible that the opinion of Williams and her neighbours may soften. This is, after all, the first year of the new turbine, and as yet they are perhaps still sizing it up. “We can see the shadow flicker, but we can’t hear it, which is great,” she concedes. “And I know when the leaves come out I won’t see it again.” Sarah MacDonald, landlady of the Rose Inn, Redwick’s pub, is less concerned. “Personally it hasn’t impacted me at all, not remotely,” she says. “I can’t speak for anyone else, but it’s not been a topic of conversation in the pub.” There was, she recalls, more concern when the two turbines were proposed at the Tesco distribution centre. “But it’s like anything else, people get used to them. At the end of the day, it’s renewable energy, and everyone’s got to think of the future.” When the first electricity pylons arrived on our landscape in 1928, they too were met with objection and detraction. A letter to the Times the following year raised vociferous complaint about plans to erect pylons across the Sussex Downs and was signed by figures such as John Maynard Keynes and Rudyard Kipling. But still the pylons came – from the first erected near Edinburgh to the 90,000 that now stand across the land. Recently, the National Grid unveiled its new-style T-pylons at its training centre in Eakring, Nottinghamshire. Designed by the Danish architecture and engineering firm Bystrup, the new pylon is about a third smaller than its predecessor; it is also paler and slimmer, and shares a certain aesthetic with wind turbines. Bystrup state its intention was to “minimise visual impact and create a design that could adapt well to the English landscape”. Inevitably, there will be those who object to the T-pylon, who will want to romanticise the traditional design as an emblem of a century that has rejoiced in access to electricity. Indeed, our relationship with the pylon says much about our relationship to the idea of electricity. In 1927, unveiling the American design for our distinctive lattice-work transmission towers – less brutal in design than those across mainland Europe and the US – the architect Reginald Blomfield hoped the name “pylons” would grant the structures a kind of mystical awe or poetic power, the word a reference to the gateways of ancient Egyptian temples said to carry the energy of the human spirit to the afterlife. Despite the early objections, the pylon became a symbol of the thrill of energy and the future, the connection to the modern world. In the 1930s, they even gave name to a school of poetry – Cyril Connolly referred to the youthful, leftwing poets WH Auden, Cecil Day-Lewis, Louis MacNeice and Stephen Spender as the “Pylon boys” for their self-conscious use of modern technology; Spender’s poem The Pylons was published in 1933: “those pillars,” he wrote, “bare like nude giant girls that have no secret”. But after the fuss and the first flush, we have fairly ceased to notice them. As Kellaway notes, their design is largely transparent, a dance of geometry and air. But their acceptance also says much about our relationship with nature. Our pylons, like our roads and railways, our canals and our shipyards, show our presence here; they form part of our history as much as our cathedrals and our stately homes. And after all, nature wreaks its own havoc: shingle, shale, stagnant water, broken branches, worm casts, flooded land; those bare trees of winter expose not just a view of wind turbines but of last year’s abandoned nests. We do not have to look hard for examples of man’s arrogance, ignorance or ineptitude, his evidence of destruction; the fossil fuels burned, the seas and lands depleted, the habitats and ecosystems disturbed. But landscape, like language, is constantly, gloriously in transition. It does not stay still. And to me, as I hope to a gathering many, the wind turbine stands as a symbol of a new and respectful intention towards the Earth. As Spender put it: “There runs the quick perspective of the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/12/iran-nuclear-tensions-uranium-conversion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-12T12:03:39Z","webTitle":"Iran soothes nuclear tensions by resuming uranium conversion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/12/iran-nuclear-tensions-uranium-conversion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/12/iran-nuclear-tensions-uranium-conversion","fields":{"headline":"Iran soothes nuclear tensions by resuming uranium conversion","bodyText":"Iran has confirmed it has resumed the conversion of medium-enriched uranium into oxide fuel, slowing down the growth of its stockpile and creating more time for talks on its nuclear programme. Asked about reports from diplomatic sources that conversion was under way again after a break of a few months, the foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: \"This work is being done and all its reports have been sent to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a complete manner.\" The significance of the move is that since Iran started making 20% enriched uranium in 2010, international concern has focussed on the possibility that it might ultimately make a nuclear bomb. Uranium enriched to 20% is much easier to turn into weapons-grade (90% enriched) material than the 3.5% enriched fuel Iran has been making for more than a decade, ostensibly for future nuclear power stations. At the time of the last IAEA report, in November, Iran had produced almost 233kg of 20% enriched uranium, but had diverted only around 100kg towards making uranium oxide fuel, which is much harder to enrich further. The tensions around the 20% stockpile grew in September when the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told the UN general assembly that Israel would not tolerate Iranian accumulating enough 20% to make one bomb, which Israeli officials defined as 240kg. Other international experts say it could take as much as 380kg. The outgoing Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, said in October that the Iranian decision to use some of its stockpile to make fuel had put off an Israeli decision to take military action by \"eight to 10 months\". But the November IAEA report said the conversion process had stopped, raising fears that the stockpile could grow faster, closing the window for diplomacy. Inspectors told the IAEA board at the time that the halt appeared to have been for technical reasons. If so, those now appear to have been overcome. A new IAEA report is due out in the next few days which will show just how fast the 20% stockpile has been accumulating and how much of it has been used for fuel. It will set the scene for the next round of nuclear talks between Iran and six major powers in the Kazakh city of Almaty on 26 February. The faster the stockpile is growing the greater the sense of urgency around the talks, although US and British officials reject Israel's argument that its 240kg red line marks a strategically significant milestone in an Iranian advance towards weapons-making capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jun/23/drifting-off-the-coast-of-portugal-the-frontrunner-in-the-global-race-for-floating-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-23T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Drifting off the coast of Portugal, the frontrunner in the global race for floating windfarms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/23/drifting-off-the-coast-of-portugal-the-frontrunner-in-the-global-race-for-floating-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jun/23/drifting-off-the-coast-of-portugal-the-frontrunner-in-the-global-race-for-floating-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"Drifting off the coast of Portugal, the frontrunner in the global race for floating windfarms","bodyText":"Above the inky Atlantic water and beneath a clear blue sky, the giant wind turbine turns gracefully in the steady sea breeze. But the secret of this solitary turbine, sited 5km off the Portuguese coast, lies beneath the gentle swell: it has no foundations and it is floating freely on the ocean, steadied by a triangular yellow platform and decorated by lines of crab-hunting seagulls. The Windfloat turbine is one of the frontrunners in a global race to develop flotillas of wind turbines that can conquer the deep oceans and reap the strongest winds on the planet. Existing offshore wind turbines, standing on concrete and steel foundations driven into the ocean floor, flounder on heavy costs in depths greater than about 40 metres. Floating windfarms could play a key role in re-powering Japan, whose love affair with nuclear power ended after the Fukushima disaster, and whose seabed plunges steeply offshore, leaving little space for fixed turbines. The US is also keen, with huge populations near both coasts. In the UK, home to some of the world's best winds and already hosting the most offshore windfarms, floating turbines could arrive as soon as 2016. Far out to sea, they could also tackle the galeforce antipathy that in some areas have blown out plans for onshore turbines. Perching a tall windblown tower on a floating platform might seem optimistic, but hundreds of millions of dollars have already been sunk into a menagerie of prototype technologies (see The race to float below) and more than 40 projects are in various stages of development. Most are inspired by rugged oil and gas rigs that have weathered storms for decades. Pointing out the shells encrusting the legs of the Windfloat platform, Alla Weinstein, chief executive of the US company Principle Power that designed it, joked: “We're thinking of starting a Windfloat mussel business.” But the electrical engineer is deadly serious in her view of the technology's potential: “We are changing the paradigm of offshore wind and making it suitable for any location in the oceans.” The platform is only the second fullscale floating turbine to be deployed at sea and has survived a brutal winter of storms that blasted Portugal's coast, removing beaches and producing the monstrous wave that English surfer Andrew Cotton tamed in February. The turbines' blades reach 120m above the sea, stabilised by a three-pillared platform, 35m on each side. The standard 2MW turbine fixed on top has been generating electricity since 2012 and is about to pump out its 10 millionth kilowatt-hour. The rig's legs, extending 20m under the sea, contain ballast water which shifts around to control swaying. Windfloat has performed well so far and Weinstein is looking ahead to next stage of development. Principle Power's consortium, which includes the major Iberian energy companies EDP and Repsol, have won a promised €50m of EU support to scale up and deliver three or four huge 6-8MW floating turbines off Portugal by 2017, and are now raising the €100m needed to go ahead. They also aim to have five 6MW turbines in 350m-deep water off Oregon in the US by 2017, aided by $50m for the Department of Energy. The much bigger turbines will generate more power and hence more money, says Weinstein: “Size really matters in this case.” Japan is also set to be a big player, with its high population and steeply shelving coasts. “It became a market overnight, after Fukushima, and the Japanese are moving very fast,” says Weinstein. Japan's first floating turbine started operation in November 2013 and the industrial giants of Mitsibushi and Mitsui are both in the race to install 1GW by 2020 – equivalent to a nuclear power station – including 80 turbines off the Fukushima coast. The floating wind turbine pioneers are surprisingly relaxed about competition. “You can't have an industry with just one company. We need a critical mass for credibility: the more the better,” says Weinstein. The first fullscale floating turbine – Hywind - went to sea off Stavanger, Norway in 200m-deep water and sent electricity to the grid from 2010. Its design is radically different: a single, very long ballast column sinking 100m below the sea surface. Like Windfloat, it is loosely anchored to the sea bed with mooring lines. Morton Eeks, from Hywind's developer Statoil, says one feature of the design is a positioning system: \"You can remote control it to keep it on the site you want to get the best wind.” Statoil next intends to tow five 6MW turbines to the Buchan Deep, 25km off Peterhead in Scotland, as early as 2016. Eeks agrees with Weinstein about competition: \"What is needed is to see more concepts put into practice: competition will bring the prices down.” Floating wind turbines should benefit from being able to be assembled onshore, then towed to position, avoiding costly bad-weather delays. Iñigo Palacio Prada, from Spanish energy company Repsol, which has invested in Windfloat as well as windfarms off Scotland, says: “Floating turbines won't be cheaper [to install] than onshore, but you have to go where the best wind is.” Turbines at sea can run 50% more efficiently due to the stronger winds. Breanne Gellatly, co-leader of the UK Carbon Trust's Offshore Wind Accelerator, says floating wind turbines will be essential in unlocking the offshore wind resource in deeper waters. She also notes a particularly British advantage: “They can be placed 20 miles offshore and therefore have the advantage of being 'out of sight and out of mind'.” Conservative cabinet minister Eric Pickles has recently blocked a series of onshore windfarms. The potential is - in theory – great, says Gellatly, noting that two-thirds of the very windy North Sea is between 50m and 220m: “Energy produced from floating turbines in the North Sea alone could meet the EU’s electricity consumption four times over.” However, Micha Strauss, vice president at Enercon, a German turbine manufacturer that has a large factory at the nearby Portuguese port of Viana do Castelo, disagrees. The plant turns out hundreds of turbines a year: every one for onshore windfarms. “We don't believe offshore wind is a good business model on cost grounds,” he says. “As long as there is enough land on Earth, we don't need to increase the difficulty of installation by going to sea.” For politicians, the jobs brought by renewable energy are as important as the power, and Portugal's government – unlike Spain's – was careful to avoid killing investment with retroactive cuts to subsidies. Jorge Moreira da Silva, Portugal's energy and environment minister, told the Guardian: “It isn't just an energy sector, it's an industrial sector, an innovation sector and a regional development sector.” His aim is to make Portugal a key supplier of green energy to Europe: “We will be able to produce it at lower cost as we have better wind and sun than other countries. It is a win-win: citizens get cheaper energy and it is good for jobs an investment in Portugal too.” He adds: “We can also be a solution to reducing the European reliance on Russian gas.” Da Silva backs floating wind turbines as part of this: “We really think it can be a cutting-edge solution for coasts like Portugal and California.” For Thomas Becker, the Danish CEO of the European Wind Energy Association, the commercial viability of floating windfarms will be proven – or not – in the next few years: “But it looks good so far.” He is scathing about the anti-wind power sentiment of some in the UK. “Maybe they are there, but I can't see the other big industrial ventures that the UK is going to live off in the future,” he says. “One sector where the UK clearly have a great advantage is wind: you have a great resource and great engineers. It is so obvious.” All agree that the key to launching a global flotilla of floating turbines is driving costs down, with Gellatly estimating the price will have to fall two to four times to reach the same level as fixed turbines. But the technology is still very young and has survived all the sea can throw at it so far, unlike a predecessor on the very site now occupied by Windfloat. Experimental wave power machines were tested here in 2008 but, in that case, the savage sea won. The race to float Three key designs are racing to provide the first commercial floating wind turbines, all adapting technologies proven by the offshore oil and gas industry. Semi-submersible A broad platform provides stability by largely lying below the sea surface and using water as ballast. It is loosely anchored to the sea floor. Windfloat has had its full-scale prototype in the ocean off Portugal since 2011 and its 2MW wind turbine is on the brink of generating 10GWh of electricity. Key companies: Principle Power (US), Mitsubushi (Japan), Mitsui (Japan), DeepCWind (US) Gusto (Netherlands), HiPRwind (Spain) Tension-leg platform and spar Spar A long single column extends far below the water to dampen movement and uses sand and water as ballast. It is also loosely moored to the sea floor. Hywind's fullscale prototype has been generating electricity off Norway since 2010. Key companies: Hywind/Statoil (Norway), Toda (Japan), Sway (Norway) NauticrAft (Australia), SeaTwirl (Sweden) Tension-leg platform A floating platformed is tethered firmly to the sea bed using tensioned cables. BlueH tested a small prototype in 113m of water off Italy in 2008. Turbine can be mounted on the platform onshore, avoiding expensive ships and bad weather delays. It is not suitable for areas with high tidal ranges. Key companies: BlueH (UK), Gicon (Germany), Pelastar (US), Iberdrola Etorgai (Spain) Mitsui (Japan). • This article was amended on 23 and 25 June 2014 because an earlier version mistakenly stated the capacity of Principle Power's planned wind farms in GW. This has been corrected to say MW.

From 2008 to 2010, construction work began on 38 reactors around the world, but in 2011-12, there were only two construction starts, according to Steve Thomas, professor of energy studies at the University of Greenwich. The fall was interpreted by some as evidence of rapidly waning interest in nuclear power after the forced shutdown of the Fukushima reactor a year ago, in which no one was killed but thousands of people were forced to flee their homes. But others argued it was merely a temporary pause, and predicted the \"nuclear renaissance\" would continue. Rebecca Harms, president of the Greens/EFA group in the European parliament, called on countries to abandon their nuclear ambitions, saying Fukushima had shown that the safety of reactors could not be guaranteed. \"We failed to learn the lessons of Chernobyl – otherwise Fukushima would not have happened,\" she told a small demonstration outside the European parliament in Brussels. The former governor of Fukushima prefecture, Eisaku Sato, repeated her call: \"We are living with the evacuation. We believe there should be no more people like us.\" In Europe, Germany has vowed to phase out atomic plants and Italy and Switzerland have also voted against nuclear energy, while public opinion in some other countries is uncertain. Jo Leinen MEP told an audience at the Friends of Europe group in Brussels: \"A nuclear renaissance in Europe? I can't see it.\" But Connie Hedegaard, Europe's climate chief, said nuclear power would continue to be part of the European and world energy mix for years. \"The reality will be that it will still play a part,\" she said. \"It will probably not grow as much as people thought it would before Fukushima. Many countries will still move forward [with nuclear plans] but with an increased focus on security.\" Christoph Frei, secretary general of the World Energy Council, told the Guardian that his organisation's research showed there was still a need for and interest in nuclear power around the world, with many countries including the UK intending to push forward with plans for new plants. \"The nuclear renaissance is continuing,\" he said. The true lesson of Fukushima, according to Patrick Moore, honorary chairman of Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy Canada, was not of nuclear risk but of nuclear safety, as there had been no fatalities and appeared to be no long-term damage. He said: \"There is no good reason to be afraid of nuclear power. It is not harming anyone and it did not harm anyone in Fukushima.\" Before the Fukushima incident, nuclear power generators had been enjoying a return to favour in many parts of the world. The Chernobyl accident in 1987 chilled investment in nuclear around the world for well over a decade, but in recent years that changed – as countries began to engage with the problem of climate change, and as rapidly developing economies sought ways to satisfy their hunger for energy, the technology came under serious consideration again. Many dozens of new reactors were planned, and the nuclear industry rebranded itself as an environmentally friendly technology, arguing that as reactors do not produce carbon dioxide they should be seen as part of the solution to climate change, and could provide back-up to intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power. After Fukushima, the shockwaves were also felt beyond phase-outs by European governments. Kuwait pulled out last month of a contract to build four reactors, Venezuelan froze all nuclear development projects and Mexico dropped plans to build 10 reactors. \"Fukushima was like the spark that lit the debate,\" said Tobias Münchmeyer of Greenpeace in Germany. \"The shocked German public forced Chancellor Merkel either to phase out nuclear or to phase out herself. When the government took eight reactors offline it was surprising to some people that we did not have blackouts or price spikes. It cost a bit, but it also stimulated growth in renewable [energy] and we now have 300,000 jobs in renewables compared to 30,000 in nuclear.\" Moore claimed, however, that Germany was already in the process of building 13GW of fossil fuel power stations and was making plans for 10GW more – altogether, as much power as is generated from 23 reactors – in order to make up for the shortfall in nuclear energy. Protests against proposed plants already under construction have intensified in India, which plans to quadruple nuclear capacity by 2020 and triple it again to generate 25% of its electricity by 2030. Mass protests and hunger strikes by social movements led to deaths, injuries and riots in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Jaitapur. Construction of two plants in Tamil Nadu was delayed and West Bengal dropped plans for six Russian reactors following protests. Last month India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, blamed US and German groups for whipping up protests. \"We have been carrying out hunger strikes, rallies, public meetings, seminars, conferences, and other demonstrations such as shaving our heads, cooking on the street, burning the models of the nuclear plants. This struggle has been going on for the past 197 days and the morale of the people is still very very high,\" said S P Udayakumar, co-ordinator of the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy. \"This is a classic David-Goliath fight between the 'ordinary citizens' of India and the Indian government supported by the multinational companies, imperial powers and the global nuclear mafia. They promise nuclear power, development, atom bombs, security and superpower status. We demand risk-free electricity, disease-free life, unpolluted natural resources, sustainable development and a harmless future,\" he said. China's stance on nuclear is being keenly watched. Before Fukushima, the Chinese government had plans to add 40GW of nuclear by 2020. But construction plans in several provinces were plagued with protests about safety and lack of consultation. Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute in Beijing, said: \"Globally, I think Fukushima could be a good thing for nuclear power. We can learn a lot from that. We can't be smug or too clever.\" According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, 45 countries are now considering embarking on nuclear power programmes, as Vietnam, Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Belarus are likely to start building this year and Jordan and Saudi Arabia following in 2013. In the UK, strong opposition to nuclear power has soared since the Fukushima disaster, according to a recent Guardian/ICM poll. In early 2010, 39% of people said they would be strongly opposed to a new nuclear power station being built near their home but in February 2012 that rose to 61%. However, an Ipsos Mori poll asking a different question – how favourable people felt towards nuclear power – found that support for nuclear had rebounded to pre-Fukushima levels of 40% in favour by December 2011. Internationally, 62% of citizens in 24 countries said they were opposed to nuclear power, in an Ipsos Mori poll conducted in June 2011, three months after the Fukushima catastrophe. Only India, Poland and the US had majorities supporting nuclear power, with the UK evenly split, China, Russia and France clearly opposed and Germany very strongly opposed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2014/feb/26/dont-teach-children-avoid-mathematics","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-26T21:00:02Z","webTitle":"Don't teach children to avoid mathematics | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/26/dont-teach-children-avoid-mathematics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/feb/26/dont-teach-children-avoid-mathematics","fields":{"headline":"Don't teach children to avoid mathematics","bodyText":"Simon Jenkins earns his corn through provocation but does not need to encourage young people to follow his example by studying subjects which do not require mathematics (Comment, 19 February).

As for salespeople, I do not wish to denigrate the importance of the arts and fashion industries to our economy, but buyers of manufactures are probably more prevalent in the UK than sellers of the same. They require scientific literacy and preferably an ability to speak a foreign language (too much like hard work!). Since the UK is in the business of buying nuclear power stations, fast trains and flood controls, as well as updating IT systems without wasting more billions, the shortage of scientific/technical expertise in the government, the civil service and the opinion-forming media is a gross disadvantage. Far from castigating mathematics, we should reform pre-university education along the lines of the international baccalaureate, in which all major subjects are compulsory. CN Dack Leicester • The problems that Simon Jenkins points out are widely recognised in the mathematics education community, here and around the world.

The potential of a different mathematics curriculum for empowering and enriching lives is well-established. We know how to enable teachers to teach like this, but it involves a profound change in the balance of their practice from pupils' learning procedures to their thinking through problems that seem worthwhile to them. The reasons these changes have not happened are systemic – a mixture of self-inflicted wounds in policy and bad \"engineering\" of the design and implementation.

But while such a populist policy may have a marginal impact by lowering gas prices, it would do so by subsidising inefficient industries and reducing incentives for renewable energy. Back in March, I wrote how the opening of the eastern gas market to the world through the Gladstone port facility would increase gas prices for those living in the eastern states. So it was, with a bitter sort of validation, to receive a letter from my gas supplier in June that “from 1 July 2014, there will be a 14.5 per cent increase in ACT gas prices.” The reason given was “the increasing influence of international markets on Australia’s gas prices”. To understand this impact we need to look at the current world market for gas. It is effectively divided into three sections – Europe, Asia and North America. Australia’s market is Asia, although predominately Japan and South Korea, as neither produces natural gas but together account for 5.1% of the world’s consumption. Also, as with everything in Australia’s economy, China is important. Its consumption of natural gas has exploded in the past decade: Japanese consumption has increased markedly in the past three years due to the Fukishima nuclear power station disaster causing the country to switch its reliance on electricity generation from nuclear to gas. Australia is currently the second biggest supplier of LNG to China and the biggest to Japan: The increase in Japanese natural gas consumption caused the price of natural gas in the Japanese market to rise significantly above that of Europe and well above the US: In the past this had no impact on eastern states consumers of gas, but this year shipping of LNG from Gladstone in Queensland to Japan is set to begin. It means that not only will Australian gas production more than double by 2020 from 43 bcm to 102bcm, but that producers can now sell LNG for higher prices in Japan than they have previously received from domestic consumers. The price for LNG in Japan is around US$15 per gigajoule (GJ) – that includes shipping and converting gas into LNG and back again, which comes to around US$5-US$6 per GJ. Thus the equivalent price in Australia would be around $9 per GJ– well above the current price of around $4 per GJ. And thus householders are receiving letters like I did informing them of big price increases. Over the past couple years, manufacturing employer groups and the AWU have made noises about the need for the government to protect Australian businesses and households from rising gas prices. This week the AWU launched its “Reserve our Gas” campaign, which argues that a certain percentage of LNG production should be set aside for domestic use. Such a policy is already in place in Western Australia, where 15% of output from LNG projects within the state must be reserved for sale in the domestic gas market. The campaign coincides with the Productivity Commission commencing a research project into the gas markets that will “investigate the implications of linking to global markets for various gas market participants”. The case for a reserve is based on the view that other countries have similar policies and thus Australia should too. Advocates compare us to Canada and the US, although really they’re poor comparisons. Canada exports its gas via pipeline to the US rather than ship to the more expensive Asian market. And while the US does currently have export restriction, these are likely to be reduced with the US looking to increase its exports of LNG over the coming decade. If this occurs, its much lower gas prices will likely rise as well, though given the size of the US domestic market, it is likely to be more muted than will happen in Australia. The other justification for a reserve policy is that WA already has one, so it could just be extended to the rest of Australia. But while gas prices in WA for a time rose at similar or lower rates than in the eastern states, since the boom in LNG prices after the GFC, WA’s gas price increases have outstripped that of the eastern states. Indeed, WA gas prices are currently higher than those in the eastern states and are forecast to be higher still in 2020, suggesting that the reserve policy has only a limited affect on limiting gas price rises. The Grattan Institute’s Getting Gas Right paper argues that reserving gas for domestic production subsidises domestic manufacturers and households in much the same way as tariffs once protected Australian industries. But, it argues, such protectionism only serves to breed inefficient industries and reduce our competiveness. The reserve policy also has environmental implications. While gas generated electricity produces fewer emissions than black or brown coal, long-term cheaper gas would serve to make renewable energy supply from sources such as wind less competitive. Keeping gas prices low encourages a switch from coal to gas generated electricity, whereas if gas prices were to rise in line with the international market, renewable energy becomes a more attractive alternative. Given there is evidence that building new wind farms is already more cost effective than building new gas or coal fired power generators, a reserve policy would in effect subsidise fossil fuel energy at a time when renewable energy technology is driving lower costs. It is perhaps not a surprise that a gas reserve policy would have a negative impact on the renewable energy industry given that the AWU has also campaigned for the aluminium industry be made exempt under the Renewable Energy Target. Instead of imposing a reserve on gas production, it would be far better for the government to instead put in place better tax arrangements to capture revenue from this boom in production. In 2012, the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax was amended to include coal seam gas and yet due to the design of the tax, most companies expect to pay little extra tax. A reserve policy only provides benefits to households, whereas governments could use the tax revenue for wider community benefit. Australians are going to be paying more for gas in the future whether we like it or not. But establishing a gas reserve policy would do little to alter this fact. Even if it keeps gas prices low, it would do so only through the heavy long-term cost of subsidising inefficient industries and supporting fossil-fuels over renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/mar/30/what-is-nuclear-power-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-30T15:21:39Z","webTitle":"What is the future of nuclear power in the UK? | Rob Edwards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/30/what-is-nuclear-power-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/30/what-is-nuclear-power-future","fields":{"headline":"What is the future of nuclear power in the UK?","bodyText":"What is the problem with Britain's nuclear power programme? The German energy companies RWE and E.ON have abandoned plans to build two new nuclear power stations at Wylfa on the island of Anglesey in north Wales and at Oldbury on the Severn estuary. Depending on the interpretation, this is either a \"total train wreck\" or just a \"disappointing\" setback for the government's nuclear ambitions. The truth, of course, is somewhere in between. A combination of last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, the German government's subsequent decision to phase out nuclear power and the general economic downturn has long made investments in new reactors look shaky. The sums of money are so large, the potential liabilities so daunting and the financial paybacks so uncertain, that investors have always been wary about nuclear power. Expect more setbacks. So is nuclear power doomed? Unlikely. The industry is politically very powerful and has successfully raised itself from the dead several times in the past. It has prevailed upon successive UK governments to take a series of \"facilitative actions\" to remove barriers to nuclear development. Last November, the pro-nuclear Department of Energy and Climate Change helped set up a high-powered programme management board with nuclear companies to try to prevent the nuclear project going off the rails. Britain's nuclear industry had \"lost its international edge\", the board said, yet it was now embarked on the UK's \"most challenging infrastructure programme\". Why doesn't Britain have its own nuclear energy supplier? It did, before it was denationalised by the Conservative prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, in the 1980s. That ultimately led to the creation of British Energy to run nuclear stations, which then had to be bailed out by taxpayers to the tune of more than £3bn. In 2008 British Energy was sold lock, stock and barrel to the French government's nuclear company EDF, which now runs Britain's nuclear generating stations. It is also leading the efforts to build new nuclear plants, starting at Hinkley Point in Somerset. But isn't France losing faith in nuclear power? There are certainly problems. Two reactors like the ones EDF wants for England are under construction in France and Finland and they are four years late and costing nearly twice as much as predicted. The former head of EDF, François Rousseley, has recently suggested that the reactor design should be dropped, and the French National Audit Office has agreed, saying it is complex and expensive. The replacement of president Nicolas Sarkozy at the elections later this month could also see a shake-up on nuclear policy. Could there be power cuts without nuclear? That is a threat the nuclear industry has made in the past, but it has never materialised. There are issues with future energy supplies that need to be resolved as power stations approach the ends of their lives, but there are several sources other than nuclear, including gas and renewables such as wind, though each has its drawbacks. The problem with nuclear is that it is cumbersome, capital-intensive and relatively inflexible. Not everyone agrees with the British government's insistence that nuclear has to be the way forward. The Scottish government, for example, believes it can avoid replacing its two nuclear stations by rapidly developing renewable energy instead. This week, Scottish ministers said they had already beaten their target to provide more than 30% of Scotland's electricity from renewable sources. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2012/dec/11/bbc1-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-11T15:45:57Z","webTitle":"BBC1 science show  'downplayed impact' of Chernobyl nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/11/bbc1-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2012/dec/11/bbc1-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"BBC1 science show  'downplayed impact' of Chernobyl nuclear disaster","bodyText":"BBC1 science show Bang Goes the Theory misleadingly downplayed the likely impact of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster by stating it has only claimed about 100 lives, the BBC Trust has ruled. The trust's editorial standards committee has ruled that a show broadcast on 3 October last year looking at the issue of nuclear power and the impact of radiation gave a \"misleading impression\" by failing to include research suggesting there could eventually be up to 16,000 premature deaths from the explosion and fire at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine. The trust ruled Bang Goes the Theory failed audiences by not looking at the wider impact of radiation, particularly given its mission to reveal \"the truth about the effects of radiation\". \"Viewers would be likely to be left with the impression that a relatively small number of deaths was the only serious adverse health outcome from the radiation fallout from Chernobyl,\" said the BBC Trust. \"The committee considered this would be a misleading impression based on the evidence and there had been a breach of accuracy in respect of how the programme reflected the health effects of radiation fallout from Chernobyl.\" Bang Goes the Theory was looking at the issue of nuclear power in the wake of the reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima plant in Japan following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. One section of the magazine-style show aimed to \"wipe the slate clean and find out the truth of the effects of radiation\". The show argued that in the wake of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the second world war an inaccurate public perception of the actual health risks from nuclear power plant disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima had developed. The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee (ESC) received a complaint on behalf of more than 50 co-signatories that the show was \"extremely selective\" in the figures it quoted about the impact of radiation released following the Chernobyl disaster and minimised the \"more significant and contentious issue\" of the secondary effects of health problems such as thyroid cancer. Bang Goes the Theory cited the Chernobyl Forum report as authoritative and one of its key sources for its nuclear power piece. But the ESC found that the show failed to mention in its broadcast comments made to the BBC in March last year by one of the report's principal authors that there is an expectation of 40,000 extra cancers as a result of Chernobyl, resulting in 16,000 premature deaths. A range of other evidence assessed by the ESC included a report showing there have been 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer reported in children and adolescents as of 2005 – with many more expected over the coming decades. • To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

She has stood trial in Israel, was nearly deported from Brazil and is due to be tried later this year in Spain, her home country, for an action at a nuclear power plant in Valencia. Being in police custody is par for the course when you have spent a decade aboard Greenpeace ships (not literally: the pattern is usually three months on, three months off). It is a career that has seen Mompo stand between harpoons and whales, document the environmental impact of the war between Israel and Lebanon and listen in horror to live radio updates from the captain of a nearby ship being captured by Somali pirates. She has stayed on dry land of late, writing an exhaustive history of the ships. It begins in 1971 with the maiden voyage from Vancouver of a fishing boat that had been renamed Greenpeace to protest about US nuclear testing. Seven years later came the launch of Rainbow Warrior, which was audaciously blown up by French agents in the port of Auckland, New Zealand, in 1985, to stop it interfering with nuclear tests in the South Pacific. The ship sank with photographer Fernando Pereira still on board. The legend of Rainbow Warrior lives on, with the ship now in her third incarnation, but it was on the second Rainbow Warrior (decommissioned in 2011) that Mompo worked the most. She decided she wanted to sail with Greenpeace when she was 11, “after watching the first Rainbow Warrior on TV, protecting the whales”. After school, she got a law degree, set up her local Amnesty International group, volunteered for various local pacifist and environmental groups and worked for a wind farm company. It wasn’t until she was 30 that she began volunteering for Greenpeace, and another seven years before she started working on the international ships. Nautical experience isn’t a prerequisite for the job, but Mompo, now 47 and based in southern Spain, had a passion for sailing. Soon she was saving whales herself in what was supposed to be the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary. She went out every day for a month, in a rigid inflatable boat (RIB), to hamper the work of vast Japanese whaling vessels. For safety reasons there always had to be a minimum of two boats in these actions, but Mompo remembers one occasion, over an hour into protecting a large adult minke whale, when the second RIB was forced to retreat with engine trouble. Mompo and the two other crew on her boat, she writes, “were incapable of abandoning it”. Mompo’s role was to signal the positions of both the whale and the whaler to her colleague at the wheel of their RIB, holding on for dear life as they skimmed over the waves like a “galloping horse”. The whale dived and then jumped majestically through the air, at which point, Maite writes, “we were so close that I felt its eye staring at me”. The next minute the whale was hit. (She says of the noise from a harpoon impact: “Oh my god it’s terrible. There is a grenade in the tip, so you get a huge boom and you feel your heart stopping.”) As the whalers hauled in their prey, Mompo’s boat became caught up in the line. As they attempted to free themselves, a sudden pull swept up her colleague, who was left dangling in the air between the whaler’s bow and a 10-tonne corpse. All he could do was climb down the rope and swim through icy water so that the RIB could pick him up. Afterwards, the whalers contacted Greenpeace to apologise. “They put our lives at risk and they felt ashamed about what had happened. They are not bad people,” she shrugs. “They were just tired and wanted to get the whale.” Despite the perils, Mompo never thinks in terms of dying for the cause. “I’m a very positive person,” she says, “We prepare for the actions. Of course you think maybe you are going to risk your life, or there might be an accident, but your beliefs are your engine.” A decade after Greenpeace activist Mark Hardingham was left in intensive care after getting in the way of a Norwegian whaler, Mompo sailed into Bergen to campaign for the protection of Norwegian coral reefs. Although many locals supported the project, others still despised Greenpeace for their earlier anti-whaling campaign. Spit, urine, eggs and rubbish were hurled at Rainbow Warrior. All you can do, she says, “is just say: ‘Please don’t do this, please don’t piss.’ The thing is that they just shout at you. If we could sit down and talk, we could solve things.” More often than not, though, Rainbow Warrior is greeted as an international treasure. Even most of her arresting officers have been polite. “Usually, if you are a woman they are going to treat you better. And they know you’re a Greenpeace activist who can talk to the press, and that you’re non-violent.” Sometimes the authorities are even on her side. “They ask for your identity card and take your name, then whisper: ‘I support what you are doing.’ It happens a lot,” she grins. Mompo is relaxed company. You would have to be if you’re regularly stuck on a boat with 29 others, sharing a mixed, four-berth cabin. But along with the risky manoeuvres, stormy seas and overnight stays in police holding cells comes the opportunity to make a difference, and forge friendships all over the world, while seeing its wonders first hand. “Sailing with Greenpeace has made my view of the planet bigger,” she says. “I was more pessimistic before, but now I know that wherever you go, you find people fighting to get a better environment. You see these people struggling and feel like there is hope. “You don’t usually see that,” she says, “if you stay at home.” Rainbow Warriors: Legendary Stories from Greenpeace Ships by Maite Mompo is published by New Internationalist at £14.99.

The Lib Dems thereby jettisoned a cherished but mistaken policy of nuclear opposition because members clearly understood the real-world challenges of government. Uniquely in the industrialised world, the UK now has a three-party consensus both on the reality of climate change and the clear need for new nuclear capacity to mitigate it. While Friends of the Earth and others provided predictable negative soundbites in response, the truth is that this consensus now includes much of the business community, and even – to an extent – the mainstream environmental groups. Friends of the Earth, for example, has quietly but admirably accepted a scientific review of the evidence for and against nuclear power carried out on its behalf by academics at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The review makes clear how most of the standard anti-nuclear arguments – on proliferation, waste and safety for example, have much less factual basis than most greens assume, and concludes that if gas replaces nuclear generation in future then the UK's carbon emissions will inevitably rise. Also to its credit, the renewable energy industry has begun to make common cause with the nuclear industry in supporting government moves towards a low-carbon economy. The wind energy lobby group RenewableUK has now issued several joint calls with the Nuclear Industry Association for an accelerated low carbon transition programme, even attracting support from the director of Greenpeace UK. The realities on the ground are changing too. The UK now has the largest area of coastal continental shelf devoted to offshore wind in the world. Billions of pounds of investment are now being poured into wind energy, creating thousands of jobs and promoting the UK as a hub for a new clean energy development. In August our installed wind capacity reached 10 gigawatts, enough to power 5.5m homes. Unlike Germany, which is now burning more coal because its dash to solar power is mainly aimed at eliminating nuclear rather than tackling climate change, the UK is taking a pragmatic approach that promises to be better for the environment in the longer-term. Nuclear is just as low-CO2 as wind, and takes up a much smaller area of land, so will be an essential part of the mix in future. The challenge of decarbonisation on a global scale is nothing short of epic. Rapid industrialisation in countries like India and China is adding carbon emissions equivalent to twice those of Brazil every year to the global total. As my recent ebook Nuclear 2.0 showed, if we try to eliminate nuclear power globally at the same time as rapidly growing energy consumption, we head straight into the territory of catastrophic global warming with mathematical inevitability. On the other hand, if we deploy a new generation of safer, cheaper nuclear plants on a worldwide scale – combined with an ever greater rollout of solar and wind generation – the world still has the option of keeping global temperature rise within 2C this century. The Lib Dems have realised that in a world facing serious challenges like climate change and energy security we don't have the luxury of saying 'no' to everything. The task for the UK now is to go forward and make the major investments in both nuclear and renewables that can put us firmly on a track towards clean energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jan/28/questions-uk-commitment-nonproliferation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-28T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Letters: Questions over UK's commitment to non-proliferation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/28/questions-uk-commitment-nonproliferation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jan/28/questions-uk-commitment-nonproliferation","fields":{"headline":"Questions over UK's commitment to non-proliferation","bodyText":"I was pleased that as part of your extensive coverage of the Trident options (23 January) your diarist Hugh Muir included mention of the huge disparity between public money devoted annually to nuclear disarmament verification (£2.125m) compared with replacing the Trident nuclear WMD system (£2.2bn), based on answers by the MoD to my recent parliamentary questions. You point out that defence minister Philip Dunne asserted in the recent Commons debate on Trident that the UK's nuclear \"disarmament credentials are second to none\". He also said: \"We share the vision of a world without nuclear weapons, but only if that is achieved through multilateral disarmament. We take the disarmament commitments of article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty very seriously.\" Really? I pointed out that in 1968, a UK foreign affairs minister urged other states at the UN to sign up to the newly negotiated NPT (which had been co-drafted by the UK). He promised UK support and added: \"It will, therefore, be essential to follow the treaty up quickly with further disarmament measures.\" And what did the UK actually do quickly? Mr Dunne told MPS last week proudly: \"Our continuous at-sea deterrence patrols under Operation Relentless have been operating without pause since 1969. It is the UK's most enduring military operation.\" That sounds suspiciously like the opposite of nuclear disarmament to me. Paul Flynn MP Labour, Newport West • While the Lib Dem's Trident alternatives review is a useful vehicle for considering options other than the financially catastrophic £100bn-plus price-tag of like-for-like Trident replacement, it must also include a non-nuclear option. The public don't want nuclear weapons and the military think they're useless: and are now paying the price in cuts to service personnel. Danny Alexander (Report, 23 January) says he would like to give \"the British people a chance to have a say on this subject\". But it seems he would prefer to choose what they have to say. By not including a non-nuclear option in the review, he is declining to listen to the majority of the British public who would rather see billions spent on healthcare, social services and education than on an obsolete weapons system. Kate Hudson General secretary, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament • The Ministry of Defence claims that prolonged closure of the Aldermaston plant which makes enriched uranium components for Trident nuclear warheads could force the government to buy material from the US (Report, 25 January). This would be illegal. Article 1 of the non-proliferation treaty categorically states: \"Each nuclear-weapons state undertakes not to transfer, to any recipient, nuclear weapons, or other nuclear explosive devices.\" The government's civil and military nuclear strategy is in disarray. There are safety concerns at Sellafield and no secure means of dealing with the nuclear-waste mountain. Cash-strapped EDF has failed to deliver a new generation of safe European PWR nuclear power stations. It's time to call it a day – close down the nuclear power industry and scrap Trident.

That is a crude simplification of events in the electricity market – the energy secretary's price hike is wholesale rather than retail, affects just one nuclear plant, and does not kick in for a decade. But with heating bills becoming the hottest of political issues, there is enough in the caricature to make it uncomfortable. Guaranteeing a price of £92.50 for a megawatt hour for 35 years, roughly twice today's market rate, was evidently the least Mr Davey felt he had to do to entice French and Chinese money into British atomic power. He claims, rather improbably, that it will mean cheaper bills in the end; however things play out, new nuclear could have been done more cheaply if the government had simply borrowed the money and got on with rebuilding Hinkley Point itself. Monday also brought news that the hinterland of Fukushima, scene of Japan's radioactive disaster in 2011, would take three years longer than claimed to decontaminate. This slippage is in keeping with tradition. Costs and clean-up liabilities often loom larger as time goes by, while a satisfactory way of dealing with waste has always remained the same distant speck on the horizon. Many environmentalists look at the record, and conclude it would be better to throw everything at renewables and efficiency. Until very recently, Mr Davey's party was in this camp. \"Liberal Democrats will,\" the manifesto pledged, \"reject a new generation of nuclear power stations; based on the evidence nuclear is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable energy.\" The tortuous words and Lib Dem right-to-abstain in the coalition agreement are reminiscent of university fees. The difference this time is that Mr Davey, who also did much to remove the sting from Royal Mail privatisation, took the time to make the argument and win over enough activists to duck the betrayal charge. His case at the party conference, which is embraced by an influential minority within the green movement, is that climate changes everything. That it is, in sum, better to accept the ugly known unknowns of nuclear power than to sleepwalk into the half-knowable consequences of climatic chaos. Like it or not, this is a serious argument. Within Mr Davey's energy department, however, there will have been at least as much fretting about keeping the lights on, after the fifth of UK electricity generated by old nuclear stations gets switched off. Plugging the gap entirely through turbines – generation that comes and goes with the wind – would be tricky in the extreme. There ought to be scope to do far more through efficiency and investment in other renewables, but a Tory-dominated administration in which the chancellor boasts about making sure Britain is not a world leader in fixing climate isn't heading that way. Thus it was that the energy secretary came to conclude that he had no alternative but to go nuclear – at any price. Desperation is never a good state of mind for negotiation, and so it is especially unfortunate the Hinkley Point overhaul is being done in a manner that demanded so much haggling. The spin is that \"the private sector is doing the job\" but, in practice, regulation of price and rates of return, not to mention international treaty obligations regarding safety, mean that a government stands behind every nuclear plant in the world. In this case, Whitehall is getting state-owned corporations in Paris and Beijing to do the borrowing, which it will then partially underwrite before handing the bills on to British customers into the distant future. The contractual small print gives too much security to the investors, and too little power to the customer when the inevitable contingencies crop up. New nuclear power is coming to Britain through a variant of the PFI, which we might call the Foreign Finance Initiative. It will be decades before we can judge whether the financial waste left behind is any less radioactive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2014/apr/29/siemens-enters-alstom-takeover-battle-general-electric","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-29T22:55:00Z","webTitle":"Siemens enters Alstom takeover battle with General Electric","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/29/siemens-enters-alstom-takeover-battle-general-electric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/apr/29/siemens-enters-alstom-takeover-battle-general-electric","fields":{"headline":"Siemens enters Alstom takeover battle with General Electric","bodyText":"Germany's Siemens has formally entered into a takeover battle with the US's General Electric for Alstom, the French company that makes Eurostar trains. Siemen's official offer on Tuesday came after the French government encouraged European firms to submit rival bids to head off GE's $13bn (£7.7bn) surprise takeover offer. The German firm is also in talks with Rolls-Royce to buy the British company's gas turbines business for almost £1bn. Rolls confirmed on Tuesday night that the talks are at a late stage but cautioned that the deal has not been signed and refused to comment on the price, which is understood to be between £900m-£1bn. The group, saved from bankruptcy by the French state a decade ago, employs 18,000 people in France and has a market value of about €8.3bn (£6.8bn). President François Hollande has met the head of GE, Jeffrey Immelt, as well as Siemens's chief executive, Joe Kaeser, and its chairman, Gerhard Cromme. Alstom looked almost certain to fall into GE's hands until France's economy minister intervened on Sunday. Arnaud Montebourg made it clear that he was actively seeking \"other solutions\" to the GE bid, telling reporters that Paris \"is expressing its patriotic concern and vigilance\". He added: \"We are working to improve the offers to make sure that French companies … do not become prey. On the other hand we are open to alliances that help to equip us for globalisation. \"We've already got an extra 48 hours since Sunday evening. We will now get the necessary time to ensure national industrial interests are preserved.\" Montebourg has called on Alstom to take a month to evaluate the bids and has refused to rule out nationalisation of its nuclear power business, which is considered a nationally strategic asset. Montebourg told the French parliament on Tuesday: \"An offer by German company Siemens is being presented. It is currently being submitted into the hands of the board of Alstom,\" before Siemens could release news its intention. Montebourg's comments forced Siemens into releasing a hurried statement. \"The managing board and the supervisory board of Siemens decided on Tuesday to make an offer to Alstom,\" it said. \"The prerequisite for this offer is, that Alstom agrees to give Siemens access to the company's data room and permission to interview the management during a period of four weeks, to enable Siemens to carry out a suitable due diligence. A letter in this regard was submitted this afternoon to the French company.\" Siemens, which makes Germany's ICE high-speed trains, is said to have approached Alstom with a proposal to exchange part of its train business and cash for the French firm's power arm. GE is reported to have offered $13bn for Alstom's power turbines division, which contributes 70% of its revenues. Montebourg also expressed annoyance at Alstom's chief executive, Patrick Kron, over claims he kept the government in the dark about negotiations with GE. He said he had asked Kron several times since about rumoured GE interest and each time the Alstom boss had said there were no plans in the pipeline. \"Must the economy minister set up a lie detector in his office for the heads of blue chip companies who don't have the basic sense of civic duty to warn their governments?\" Montebourg said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/mar/16/nuclear-power-fail-george-monbiot","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-16T12:19:07Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power will fail to achieve what George Monbiot wants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/16/nuclear-power-fail-george-monbiot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/16/nuclear-power-fail-george-monbiot","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power will fail to achieve what George Monbiot wants","bodyText":"Deciding on how best to meet the country's energy needs is difficult. There are no absolutely right answers. But one issue guaranteed to excite personal passions rather than brain cells is nuclear power. Some solutions are more convincing than others. The best make the most economic, environmental and social sense, based on facts rather than fervent beliefs. As four former Directors of Friends of the Earth, we wrote to the Prime Minster this week setting out eight major economic and political problems facing a new build nuclear programme in the UK. We have engaged in the nuclear debate for forty years. On the basis of our experience and the evidence, we concluded that the government's policy will fail. Sadly, this prompted an intemperate attack by George Monbiot. We respect Monbiot's commitment to the environment as a campaigning journalist. We share his deep desire to tackle climate change – and have dedicated our working lives to addressing it and other environmental problems. What we don't understand is why Monbiot nowhere tells us how he thinks the government can overcome a single one of the problems we set out. There is a lot in his article about what he thinks about us, as he reaffirms his belief in the nuclear dream. But he doesn't show how nuclear can go ahead without huge public subsidies, which may well be illegal under EU law. He doesn't dispute the track-record of nuclear build running many years late and way over budget. He doesn't argue about the consequent rise in already excessive energy bills to pay for nuclear electricity. Monbiot vigorously asserts what the government should do to meet our energy and climate security needs. But he doesn't deal with our central point: the Government's nuclear plans will fail to do what he and it want. The nuclear industry's history is one of broken promises. Mrs Thatcher pledged 10 new nuclear plants in 1979 – one reactor eventually sent electricity to the grid in 1995. Britain's existing fleet of Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors was described by the then Chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board as the worst civil engineering disaster in our history. The proto-type fast reactor at Dounreay is now being expensively dismantled, having never worked properly. Nor has the THORP reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Monbiot accuses us of \"jingoistic and xenophobic sentiments\" because we argued that the government was, de facto, handing over future strategic energy and climate decision-making to the French government. But EDF, the only realistic nuclear builder, is 85% owned by the French government. The crucial decisions on whether to go ahead will be taken in Paris not London, and very possibly by a much more nuclear skeptical government under a new President. In an increasingly turbulent world it is common-sense not to rely on other governments' decisions for your energy security. Especially when there is no need to do so. Monbiot found even \"more alarming\" our \"apparent willingness to downgrade the effort to tackle man-made climate change\". Nothing could be further from the truth, as he well knows from our history as campaigners We advocate a mixture of renewable energies (e.g. on and off-shore wind, solar, waste digestion, wave and tidal), combined heat and power, energy efficiency and carbon-capture-and-storage for gas to meet our energy needs. Combined with smart technology roll-out across energy grids, buildings and cities, this low carbon combination makes the most sense economically, environmentally and socially. Decc's own strategic analysis set outs at least six feasible energy scenarios, supported by its Chief Scientist, to meet energy demand and climate goals with no new nuclear. Our mix generates very significant numbers of jobs nationwide, in manufacturing, engineering, planning, management, installation, servicing and retail, which a few nuclear reactors cannot. It will help resolve the social crime of nearly 3 million unemployed. 25 years ago, 'The Economist' magazine used to be a cheer-leader for nuclear power, as Monbiot is today. No longer. In a special report this month, 'Nuclear Energy: the dream that failed', the magazine concluded that nuclear new build was just too expensive and too dangerous. We agree. Monbiot has missed the point. If, as we argue, the government's nuclear policy fails, then not only will the UK have no new nuclear stations but we will also not have any of the other low carbon options that could have been deployed if only the government had not been blinded by the nuclear illusion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2014/jul/02/stem-skills-colleges-failing-meet-industry-needs-further-education","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-02T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Stem skills: colleges are failing to meet industry needs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/02/stem-skills-colleges-failing-meet-industry-needs-further-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/jul/02/stem-skills-colleges-failing-meet-industry-needs-further-education","fields":{"headline":"Stem skills: colleges are failing to meet industry needs","bodyText":"Our report, published today, could make uncomfortable reading for further education institutions. Based on consultations with more than 100 Stem-based companies (organisations heavily reliant on science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills), we've found a growing disconnect between the types of competencies sought by industry and the learning focus of most further education colleges. The three-year review of colleges found that in almost every case, the Stem curriculum was not fit-for-purpose. In the worst examples, up to 80% of the course was misaligned with industry needs. The skills crisis is a well-aired issue, but forecasting the skills requirements tends to be based on immediate local or short-term priorities. There is no coherent vision and no national strategy. The problem has been exacerbated by the rapid technological change that is sweeping through the workplace: 3D printing, robotics, nanotechnology, cloud computing, mobile technology and the internet are causing major disruption in many sectors. New roles are proliferating, while traditional skills are falling out of fashion. The speed of change is unprecedented and the direction can be hard to predict – even tech futurists are hesitant to forecast more than a few months ahead. This throws up some daunting challenges for educators. The best help that we can give students is to encourage them to be flexible and entrepreneurial by innovating and embracing new technology, and moving in and out of sectors in response to changing industry trends. Students should no longer prepare for one role or train in a single discipline. They need to develop collaborative skills and understand that they may have many different jobs over the course of their career. What does this mean for FE colleges? Well, an earthquake of sorts. We believe Stem education should undergo a disruption inside and outside the classroom. We need to take a hard look at our curriculum. Why, for example, are so many colleges focusing on carpentry and bricklaying and ignoring building information modelling software, which will become compulsory on all government construction projects from 2016? Why are FE composite courses so rare when the material is becoming commonplace in the automotive, aerospace and marine sectors? We should also move away from outdated assessment and qualification models. These create artificial learning levels that can hold back a student's natural pace of enquiry and development. Learning should be student-led, with the tutor acting as coach and facilitator. It should be grounded in real-life scenarios and placed into context. As well as making courses more flexible and adapting to industry trends, we have to raise competencies in all age groups. In the future, the skills that we associate with higher education should be taught at sixth-form or further education level. We want to see Stem education from the age of 14 upwards restructured, with the creation of new-style polytechnics that would act as regional innovation hubs, carrying out applied research. We envisage that some colleges, as well as new universities, could convert to this type of organisation – and could collaborate with companies, local enterprise partnerships and chambers of commerce to develop long-term skills strategies for each region. Schools and community colleges could work alongside the new polytechnics, sharing resources and course materials. A coordinated skills strategy would have many advantages. As well as bringing colleges closer to local companies, it could help them differentiate their offer from other organisations, becoming highly desirable and aspirational venues for learning. In the past there has been much focus on graduate-level teaching, but we should not underestimate the exciting opportunities that are opening up for technicians with a further education background. Whether it is the installation of microrenewables in homes, understanding how GPS technology fits into agricultural equipment or finding more efficient ways of carrying out refuelling at nuclear power stations, technicians are making a valuable contribution to our vibrant Stem economies. Change is never entirely comfortable, but change in Stem education is long overdue. We invite all organisations from academia, industry and government to join the debate, helping to pave the way for a vibrant education system that our students truly deserve.

But, as Spiderman was reminded by his Uncle, with great power comes great responsibility. This isn’t a new insight. It reflects long established political understanding. Voltaire apparently said it first, while Lincoln commented “if you want to test a man’s character, give him power”. Why? Because power brings capability and choice to affect many lives (for good or for ill). Yet the idea that ‘power corrupts’ is not just a cliché. So we develop ethics programs, and accountability mechanisms as counter-balances. In the case of climate change the world’s elites hold power over the poor and vulnerable, now and into the future. Yet societies have done little to build mechanisms of ethics and accountability for such collective power, especially at international and intergenerational scales. In the global North we still struggle to understand our complicity arising from the benefits we obtain from unjust global systems. Rather than changing our behaviours – and reducing our consumption, we seek novel abatement technologies and adaptation measures as substitutes for mitigation. In this light all discussion of geoengineering is a sign of our collective ethical failure to achieve adequate progress on climate mitigation. Yet the power that shapes the system remains concentrated. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering appears to offer the potential of more rapid, perhaps more targeted control over future climates. But because of its great leverage, it threatens to concentrate power even further. In this SRM resembles nuclear weapons – and it is no coincidence that radionuclides from weapons tests could demarcate the Age of Humans. But SRM is arguably the archetypical Anthropocene technology: its signature would be visible globally and it offers both destructive potential and the prospect of management or control, perhaps even the capacity to restore the planet’s climate to something more hospitable to human civilisation. Deployed to such ends, SRM would effectively determine the living conditions of all humanity. This ‘great’ power brings difficult ethical questions. The movie Snowpiercer portrays an analogy of such an Anthropocene – a failed geoengineering experiment has plunged the earth into an ice age, reducing the human race to a few passengers on one train, their living conditions entirely determined by a tiny elite (“the driver”) in a ‘global cockpit’. The movie foresees curtailed freedoms, steepened hierarchies and exploitation of people simply as means to an end (quite literally so in the case of children of a certain size needed to keep the aging engine running). Yet the ‘ordinary’ passengers rebel, wreck the train, and choose instead to take their chances adapting to the changed climate of the new earth. Snowpiercer illustrates how environmental and technological change can reshape our ethical landscapes, changing the choices we might face. In real life too, technologies of planetary control would change our relationship with the Earth and redefine what it means to be human. Historically, even the wealthiest and most powerful individuals have remained vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes. If such forces become controllable and controlled, our roles – and our potential responsibilities - are transformed, raising many ethical questions: If humanity has the capability to prevent the extremes of climate change, by what authority might scientists or governments choose to deploy it – or not? How can democratic institutions engage with these questions? If human interventions cause harm, how will the perpetrators be held responsible? If a preventable event does harm, who is liable? We have already seen fore-shocks, with court battles in Italy over the potential liability of seismologists for earthquake forecasting. How much sharper would such battles become if the topic were not just advice or forecasts, but deliberate and active interventions in the climate? In this context ethics and science cannot be disentangled. The public understand that just because scientists work on SRM as a response to climate change, that doesn’t mean it will therefore necessarily be deployed in ways that help deliver an ethical and just response. They are acutely aware of the cultural, economic and commercial interests at play in the climate debate. They resist the prospect that geo-engineering technologies might be developed and deployed in the interests of the same corporate interests that have driven fossil fuel use, and worry that such interests could distort genuine scientific endeavour. So, both fiction and reality reveal technologies interacting with our values to change behaviours and ethical landscapes. Geoengineering is not exceptional in this respect. All technologies – from guns to seatbelts - form part of socio-technical systems. They affect people psychologically and culturally in ways that can produce perverse results. Notably they can reshape how we perceive and react to risk. For example, people buy guns to protect themselves: yet controlled epidemiological studies show that those who carry firearms are more than four times more likely to be shot than those who do not. One reason is the psychological over-confidence that comes with carrying a weapon. Believing themselves somehow ‘insured’, gun users take much greater risks, and get into dangerous situations that they would have avoided if unarmed. SRM shares some interesting characteristics with guns: we appear to need it because we have collectively failed to prevent the emergence of a major risk to society. Actors who have it might well argue against risk prevention, as they both feel personally safer, and see the technology as protecting important lifestyle, social or market freedoms and rights. Moreover, its use may both become locked in, and lock in other choices which increase risk: in a society with widespread gun ownership the gun lobby becomes a powerful actor against gun control, and the police must be routinely armed with fatal consequences for certain minorities. With a climate policy reliant on SRM, the termination problem makes stopping extremely challenging in the absence of effective decarbonisation, while the technology enables the fossil fuel lobby to encourage continued extraction and use of fossil fuel – exploiting the benefits of sunk investments - despite this also having unfairly distributed impacts. In other words, there are forms of ‘moral hazard’ associated with the technology. The term moral hazard originated where insurers were concerned that people of weak moral character would take advantage of insurance by being careless, or even defrauding insurers through acts like arson. More recent definitions focus more narrowly on the tendency of people to adjust their behaviour to a certain level of risk – so, in one classic example, the introduction of compulsory seat-belt wearing led to otherwise more risky driving and an increase in other types of car-related accidental injury. Geoengineering researchers who suggest we needn’t worry about moral hazard typically define it narrowly, and argue that such risk adjustment – resulting in less mitigation – would be reasonable because geoengineering reduces the social risk of climate change in a different way. Reflecting such assumptions, economic modelling studies often suggest reduced or delayed mitigation when geoengineering is included in the model. Philosopher David Morrow identifies two reasons why mitigation may be deterred by a greater than ‘rational’ amount – informational asymmetry and cognitive biases. He also notes that even ‘rational’ risk adjustment is not necessarily morally neutral. In the case of seatbelts, for example, much of the new risk was borne by back seat passengers and other road users including pedestrians. Economic definitions recognise the possible injustice of risk transfer. Paul Krugman defines moral hazard as “any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take, while someone else bears the cost if things go badly.” This applies to geoengineering: those who might decide to deploy it and - ‘rationally’ - reduce mitigation, are most likely to be in a different country and indeed a different generation than those bearing the brunt of the impacts if geoengineering proves either defective or ineffective. In practice, the broader socio-economic-technical system will determine whether moral hazard is greasing a slippery slope to SRM deployment – or if SRM can instead be researched – as the US National Academies hope - in ways that help us better understand the climate system, potential interventions in it, and the limits to our understanding; at the same time as humanity adopts and deploys more precautionary approaches to mitigation in the hope of never needing SRM. Understanding the limits to understanding is critical. We face a “control dilemma”. Discourses of the ‘Anthropocene’ give a misplaced confidence in the controllability of earth systems. If we place greater reliance on geoengineering, but it fails to deliver, humanity is unlikely to be able to compensate by then accelerating mitigation and adaptation. Yet if geoengineering does deliver, our technological hubris is fuelled, potentially exposing us to new, greater environmental challenges, and increasing our reluctance to tackle injustice and unsustainability by political and cultural routes. Indeed, as Andy Stirling (pdf) has highlighted, Anthropocene discourses not only suggest controllability, but in framing the alternative as catastrophe, they encourage an authoritarian depoliticisation of climate policy. In this geoengineering exemplifies the contemporary ‘post-political’ trend of ‘technological solutionism’. Arguments that – because of its high leverage and low cost – SRM could somehow sideline politics and provide a silver bullet – reach an extreme in which it is postulated that SRM might even be deployed by a single actor: a rogue geoengineer, or a ‘climate vigilante’ – a Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne figure with money and a singular view of justice. But superhero culture also emphasises the ethical dilemmas in vigilantism: the tension between justice and the rule of law. Stories of the Dark Knight illuminate the need for oversight, accountability and civil liberties - even, or perhaps especially, in times of crisis. They also remind us that while public sympathy for vigilantism signals that something is wrong with the system: this does not mean that what the vigilante does is right or ethical. Put bluntly, just because climate policy and governance does not work presently, this alone does not make geoengineering – even with democratic oversight - the right answer. In Gotham the need is to eliminate the corruption that enables criminality to flourish, not to give policemen licence to emulate Batman and terrorise criminals. In practice unilateral geoengineering – whether by states or philanthropists – seems implausible. Yet claims that SRM is a high leverage, low cost, apolitical technology persist, and could yet encourage the prospect of covert geoengineering. As others (pdf) have suggested, the fears of chemtrailers may not be wrong, merely premature. If SRM becomes bogged down in global negotiations, powerful actors might be tempted by ‘emergency’ rhetoric to avoid due process. However, in practice the more dangerous temptation remains that of treating SRM as a possible saviour and an excuse to further delay even cost-effective mitigation. Some researchers have been quick to dismiss the effects of poor character on moral hazard. But as expenses and lobbying scandals repeatedly reveal, political and corporate elites are susceptible to temptation, and - according to psychological research - more likely to cheat and act unethically than poorer groups in society. And in other experiments, people with ‘self-enhancing’ values - those that relate to the accrual of wealth, power or status to oneself - were found to be more vulnerable to the moral hazard in geoengineering. So we should be concerned about whether the relevant decision makers have the necessary moral character to take tough decisions on mitigation and adaptation, rather than adopting the prospect of geoengineering as an excuse for not upsetting political allies, campaign funders or swing voters. Such a ‘political’ moral hazard seems a bigger reason to worry than the idea that ordinary individuals might relax their efforts to cut emissions. Indeed, it is possible that many ordinary people might see geoengineering as so wacky and unpalatable that they increase their support for mitigation – the so-called ‘negative moral hazard’. Could the ‘threat’ of SRM then help win public and political support for rapid and adequate action on mitigation and adaptation – rather than offering a further excuse for sustaining economic structures that maintain elite power? We might consider a parallel in nuclear power. In Germany - where reduced energy consumption is central to the Energiewende - fears of nuclear’s dark side seem to have done as much to drive coherent and ethical climate policy as narratives of ecological modernisation and green jobs. Yet elsewhere we see this policy actively misrepresented: in certain countries failing to act effectively on climate, nuclear power – tightly linked to existing elite power structures - is still presented as the next essential step, and Germany’s choice to reject it is presented as a climate failure. It’s hard to see why SRM might be treated differently. Yet moral hazard does not mean we should avoid discussing and researching geoengineering – rather that we should do so with openness and anticipation of the potential implications. David Morrow suggests broadening the alternative scenarios researched; mindful messaging and framing; and active public and political engagement. To deter possible abuses of SRM science we should also openly discuss its politics and ethics in the context of climate complicity. And it is critical to build trust between researchers and stakeholders, enabling a meaningful form of prior consent for experimentation. Trust cannot be demanded, it needs to be earned through opening ourselves up and making ourselves vulnerable to those we want to trust us. Openness and early engagement could also enhance research substantively, helping scientists anticipate ethical challenges and put in place mechanisms to mitigate them – such as research breakpoints and stagegates; using stakeholder and public involvement to inform research choices; red-team/blue-team models; linking ethical and political research to technical work – all of which could curtail moral hazard and effectively spread grit on the slippery slopes. But there are no simple decision rules or assessment processes. Ethical questions always involve contextual judgements and require moral wisdom. The crux is to be aware, reflective and reflexive in practice, considering the ethics of each proposal from a range of perspectives. Responsible Innovation means improving anticipation, inclusion, reflexiveness and responsiveness. For example, researchers need to anticipate the risks of pathways and analyses that frame SRM as an alternative rather than complement to mitigation: these are particularly vulnerable to moral hazard, technological hubris and domination. Effective inclusion implies engaging publics early and openly about the technologies and the anticipated pathways of deployment (enabling meaningful deliberation on ‘why’ and ‘whether’, not just ‘how’). Researchers should be open to the different perspectives publics bring to such deliberations, and avoid dismissing public views as ill-informed. Researchers must also be transparent and reflective over potential vested interests; and supportive of procedural rights for transparency, public participation and access to justice with respect to experimental and pilot projects. Such continued ‘opening up’ of the geoengineering debate needs to show recognition and respect for diverse cultural values. You might think from all this that I would like to hinder further SRM research. But I do not. In fact I want to suggest two reasons why humanity should now engage with geoengineering as well as climate change: capability and complicity. By capability I mean that ethical duties can arise directly from our capacity to act to prevent or mitigate harm or injustice. Climate change is already causing widespread harm and injustice, and the problems are set to get worse. Justice demands that those with the knowledge, power and resources to act should do so – to avert dangerous climate change or to restore a more hospitable climate. Complicity means that our ability to act is reinforced by arguments from responsibility: we who have benefited materially from the actions that have caused climate change bear duties to act (as far as our individual and collective capabilities stretch). But what actions should we take? In ethics duties can come in negative and positive forms. A negative duty is one to withhold from doing harm: for example, by actively cutting our excessive consumption of fossil fuels. Positive duties to ‘do good’ are, oddly, trickier to justify: these are often seen as voluntary or charitable. Yet they might be justified by responsibility or complicity: in which case they may become compulsory, such as the forms of restorative justice which demand criminals apologise to their victims or undertake community service. CDR might be best interpreted as such a restorative or reparative duty. Could this apply to SRM too? Consider circumstances in which SRM might appear ethically desirable or preferable. For this thought experiment, we start by treating SRM deployment as ethically impermissible (because of the moral hazards, and risks of harms involved), and ask whether it could become obligatory or at least permissible as a ‘lesser evil’. The answer depends on our understanding of capability: if we can, acting collectively, avert dangerous climate change by accelerated mitigation, CDR and adaptation, this is clearly a more ethical approach. It is only when we judge that economic and climate inertia makes this implausible, that SRM should be considered. I suspect many geoengineering researchers think we are already past this point. My aim is not to argue one way or the other, but to demonstrate that our understanding of the ethics of SRM, and of our duties and aims in researching it, might change dramatically depending on a relatively small change in context. Indeed, in the face of climate unknowns and uncertainties, exactly the same physical and economic parameters could mean that non-SRM routes to climate safety are simultaneously both plausible and implausible. In other words we may live in a state of ethical indeterminacy. If so we cannot establish the ethically right path simply on the basis of consequences. But ethically, means matter as much as ends: so we also need to consider due process and virtue (in which moral excellence is primarily a function of character, rather than behaviours or outcomes). A virtue approach to climate restoration would emphasise humility – focussing on re-establishing conditions in which the system can rebalance and heal itself (absent excessive anthropogenic forcings). In practice this suggests an ethical preference for mitigation and carbon dioxide removal over adaptation or SRM. It may help here to unpack ‘restoration and repair’ a little. Ideas of ‘climate repair’ or ‘climate restoration’ are complex. Besides the framing effects of implied control and capability, there are ethical distinctions between repairing an artefact, such as a building and restoring a natural system, such as a human body or an ecosystem. In the latter we recognise our inability to return the system to a prior state, still less to restore it to some ‘original design’, and instead seek to establish conditions in which the system can re-establish (relative) autonomy and health for itself. And even in the former case we recognise that seeking the ‘perfect restoration’ of a historic artefact is a misleading and inappropriate goal: instead we understand (as Richard Sennett highlights) that changing materials and purposes imply a process of reconfiguration, and thus we demand transparency in repair work. For instance the Japanese art of Kintsugi involves repairing broken pottery with golden cement or lacquer which highlights the experience of breakage and repair. This makes a virtue of repair, makes the process legible, and leaves a durable reminder of the fragility of the subject. But arguably the thing most in need of restoration or reconfiguration is not the climate itself, but humanity’s relationship with our environment. Our exploitative, instrumental relationship with the Earth has led us into grave problems. To re-establish the conditions in which a healthy relationship can flourish we need to lose our technocratic hubris and be reconciled with the Earth. Put crudely therefore, ‘climate restoration’ might imply, on one hand, domination via geoengineering, in which a technocratic elite determines the outcomes and targets of ‘climate reconfiguration’, most likely disregarding past culpability. Here SRM may be a central tool in the climate ‘intervention’ tool box. At the other extreme we can instead conceive of restoration, by resetting conditions in which systems can heal themselves; as a form of reconciliation (with the earth and its people), offered as reparations for past injustices; with new humility. An instrumentalist approach to climate repair in the Anthropocene – majoring on SRM – risks exacerbating the problems of the discourse: enhancing authoritarian approaches; widening power disparities; and inflating hubris. If we are to live well in an Age of Humans, we need ethics to match – ethics which are cosmopolitan, environmental and global – and which include an understanding of collective complicity and capability, and a contemporary virtue of repair. In general approaches to justice that draw on ideas of recognition and capabilities appear better suited to address climate change and geoengineering responses’ implications for both people’s functioning and freedoms, now and in the future. The capabilities approach to justice allows us to think more procedurally about the outcomes that would be ethical and fair. It focuses attention not only on material outcomes and the (re)distribution of wealth, but also and critically on the development of human capabilities to live lives in ways we value (as argued by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum). A stable environment might even be seen as a meta-capability underpinning all others. But even if we don’t wish to privilege it in that way, it’s hard to argue that a stable climate is less important than access to education, or good health, for example. Following David Schlosberg I argue that it is also critical to include recognition in a capabilities approach: we need to properly recognise the various groups that are vulnerable to climate and geoengineering impacts, and the ways in which institutions and systems may impede their full participation through misrecognition – whether indigenous peoples, women (look around!) or future generations. Both Sen and Schlosberg emphasise that capabilities can best be founded on and defined through collective public deliberation. This helps us understand them as a foundation for ethical duties: in particular a duty to act politically, collectively to promote and protect capabilities for others – including the maintenance of a supportive, healthy environment in which people are not dependent on the good-will of a technical or political elite for their flourishing. In the same way that we can understand economic dependence on central bankers and captains of industry as a failure to enable individual and community capabilities, so would dependence on a climate maintenance committee of SRM engineers be such a failure. Justice and sustainability imply democratising the economy, not technocratising the environment! In ethics, both ends and means matter, but ‘a hospitable climate’ is best considered not an end in itself, but as a means towards a just and sustainable society. So how we deliver climate hospitality matters intensely. As a paradigmatic ‘Anthropocene’ technology SRM promises power to change not only the world, but also our very conceptions of what it is to be human. We therefore need SRM science which can inform and be informed by an open, deliberative and reflexive politics of reconciliation in our engagement with the climate and other environmental systems. We also – even more urgently than we need to fill technical knowledge gaps about SRM – desperately need to better understand the politics of climate change and geoengineering in an age of humans. We must explore the ways in which our responses to climate change are socially embedded and ethically loaded. And we need to understand and practice ways of doing research which don’t stimulate moral hazard or authoritarian depoliticisation of climate action.

When David Cameron became prime minister, he announced that “my great passion is building the ‘big society’ ... We need to create communities with oomph – neighbourhoods who are in charge of their own destiny, who feel if they club together and get involved they can shape the world around them.” Since then, ministers have scarcely been able to finish a sentence without using the word community. But their commitment turns out to be as hollow as the other famous claim Cameron made in his ‘big society’ speech: “we’re all in this together”. There are, it seems, just two levels of organisation that the government regards as valid: individual households and big corporations. Anything in between is either a threat or an irrelevance. For all the grand announcements about community rights and community action, there is still no such thing as society. Let me show you what I mean. In 2013, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, Ed Davey, announced “a community energy revolution”. Under the unlikely slogan “Power to the people”, last year the government explained what this meant: Local communities will be able to take control of their energy bills and help transform the energy system ... In the future, the generation of electricity by communities themselves could put pressure on energy suppliers to drive down prices, creating warmer homes, cutting carbon emissions and diversifying the UK’s energy mix. The big six companies who currently dominate the supply of energy in this country, ripping off their customers while ensuring that we remain locked into the fossil fuel economy, would, the government promised, be replaced with “the big sixty thousand”. An example of how this could work is the installation of a community energy supply in Balcombe in Sussex, the site of some of Britain’s most determined anti-fracking protests. The co-operative that local people have formed there, as an alternative to the smash-and-grab fossil fuel extraction pursued by the drilling companies, has attached £30,000 of solar panels to the roof of a cowshed. They will switch on the array within the next few days. The co-op, REPOWERBalcombe, hopes eventually to produce as much energy as the village uses, and to invest some of the profits in local energy efficiency and the alleviation of fuel poverty. I have reservations about the efficacy of solar power at these latitudes, but if it’s going to be done, it is far better done by communities, at scale, with widely distributed benefits, rather than just by individual householders, which means extra costs and resources per unit, and financial benefits flowing only to people rich enough to carry the costs of installation. There is a real possibility, as Ed Davey’s department suggested, that community energy of all kinds (not just solar) could present a serious threat to the existing system: the stitch-up that followed privatisation, which allows six companies to milk us under a dispensation no fairer than the granting of royal monopolies in the 17th century. This is more or less what has happened in Germany, whose ‘big four’ are now in serious trouble as a result of the government’s encouragement of community schemes. I believe that Germany’s priorities are wrong: that getting rid of fossil fuels is a more important task than getting rid of nuclear power, which is orders of magnitude less dangerous. But despite proceeding with a ball and chain around its leg (the irrational pledge to abolish the nation’s primary source of low carbon energy, which impedes the transition away from oil, gas and coal) the government there has at least succeeded in challenging the big energy companies’ licence to print money. One result is that at the end of November the German company E.ON (which is also one of our big six), whose prior commitment to cooking the planet prompted protesters to devise the immortal slogan “E.ON: F.OFF”, announced that it would spin off its fossil fuel business and “focus on renewables, distribution networks, and customer solutions”. There are, however, grounds for suspicion about the motivation of such companies. This was the future promised to the UK by Ed Davey’s department. In this oligarchs’ island paradise, whose government often seems to be little more than a channel for corporate power, it sounded too good to be true. And it was. His coalition partners have now sabotaged Davey’s community energy revolution. The big six can relax: their inordinate profits remain safe on these shores. First, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) changed the rules under which energy co-operatives could be established. As a result of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act passed into law last year, the model that has proved so successful in Germany has been deemed ineligible here. The FCA has been rejecting attempts to establish new energy co-ops on the grounds that they sell the electricity they produce on to the grid, rather than to their members. Then the treasurer, George Osborne, quietly slipped a change to the tax rules into last year’s autumn statement. Uniquely among small new businesses, community energy schemes will, from April, no longer be eligible for two major incentives to investors: Enterprise Investment Scheme and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme tax relief. A different relief scheme will be available to community groups, but only if they are set up as “community benefit societies”, which are “charitable or philanthropic in character”. The profits of these societies cannot be distributed to their members or shareholders. In other words there’s a tax incentive to invest in a business that cannot make you any money, but no incentive to invest in a business that can turn a profit. A perfect formula for ensuring that nothing changes. As almost all energy co-ops rely on the usual business model – people invest and expect a return on their money – and as margins are fairly tight, this means, in effect, the likely death of community energy in Britain. In all other circumstances the government celebrates the profit motive as being the primary, or even sole, means by which social benefits are delivered. But when the profit motive threatens the position of the big six, the high priests of Mammon suddenly become an order of Franciscan monks. This is not the government of enterprise; it is the government of monopolies. Its mission is to protect its major donors and lobbyists against effective competition. Through privatisation, successive UK governments have created a tollbooth economy, whose gatekeepers enrich themselves at public expense. The profits of the big six (and utility companies operating in other sectors) arise from the same treasure house as the wealth of the Russian and Mexican oligarchs: a state licence to rob the public. I mentioned that there are two units of organisation regarded as valid by this government: corporations and households. While community energy has been torpedoed, the absurd incentives for rich families remain protected. As the Guardian revealed earlier this month, the Renewable Heat Incentive was rolled out by the government without any basic tests, safeguards or quality standards. The rich have been encouraged through amazingly generous incentives to install biomass boilers so inefficient that they don’t meet the official definition of renewable energy, under a scheme which encourages as much waste as possible. The bigger the boiler and the more fuel you burn, the more money you are given. So rich people now run their oversized boilers at full steam, and leave the windows open to cool the house. The returns are astonishing: 20, 30, sometimes 40%. I’m told that there are farmers who have used this incentive to install biomass-fired grain dryers, which would normally operate for just a few weeks a year. But because the scheme pays them to burn wood pellets, they keep the empty dryers running year-round. This scheme is expected to cost us around £10bn, while doing little to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. As hundreds of thousands languish in fuel poverty, forests are being felled so that rich people can burn wood with the windows open to profit from a government-approved scam. Does that sound like good policy to you? All this has the incidental effect of ensuring that there is no serious threat to fossil fuel production and consumption: in other words no threat to the interests of the corporations with which the Conservative party has a symbiotic relationship. You can see the effects of this relationship in the infrastructure bill now passing through parliament, which, outrageously, places a legal duty on future governments to maximise the economic production of oil in the UK, and in the government’s refusal of planning permission for most wind farms. Never mind the living world; never mind the future of humanity. What counts is the financial interests of the fossil fuel producers. I asked the FCA why the rules have been changed. It told me it has to work within the new act. It repeatedly stressed that energy co-operatives could set themselves up as community benefit societies if they choose, apparently unaware that this would destroy the incentive under which around 90% of them have formed, and which has propelled the transformation of the German energy market. “There is no need for community energy projects to be constrained or undermined” by this model, it told me, which suggests that it has no knowledge of the impact of its policy. I bet Ed Davey is fulminating. I think he was sincere in seeking a community energy revolution, but the Treasury and other departments have made this impossible. It’s a classic example of the triumph of what Thomas Piketty calls patrimonial capital: a rentier economy of robber barons crushing the breath out of new entrants and alternative models. Overseen, of course, by a government that claims to be the champion of free enterprise.

Why privatisation is the key to the election","bodyText":"With a few days to go to one of the tightest elections Britain has known, I found myself doing something I, like most people, hardly ever do: reading a political speech. The Conservative MP who made it is seen as an amiable, able plodder wary of offending anyone, even his political enemies. The Spectator calls him “blankly unimaginative”. So why do parts of what he had to say that day in February make him sound as if he is standing in the pews of the Commons waving a bottle of petrol with a burning rag stuffed in it? Parliament, he said, could do much for the working classes, “to take them out of that miserable condition in which they now find themselves – namely that, even if they want to have decent homes, they cannot get them”. To modern ears, that is incendiary stuff from a Tory. The speaker is Richard Cross, home secretary in Benjamin Disraeli’s government of the 1870s, the man who wove the strands of health and housing reform, slowly spun in the preceding decades, into law. If his speech from 1875 is remembered now, it tends to be for the way it kicked off, in a harsher key. “I take it as a starting point,” Cross said, “that it is not the duty of the government to provide any class of citizens with any of the necessaries of life.” Could it be that this soundbite survives because it is the sort of thing modern leftwingers expect a Conservative to say, based on recent experience, and the kind of credo modern rightwingers like to imagine their predecessors holding, rather than because it actually reflects what Cross was up to? In fact, providing citizens with one of the necessaries of life was the very thing the British government began to do that same year, when Cross steered through a bill that obliged the wealthy to subsidise the country’s first national network of mains water and sewers, serving the poor as well as the rich. In the century following the passing of the Public Health Act of 1875, the hideous squalor of Britain’s industrial cities, which had led to millions dwelling in exhaustion and misery and to plague-like levels of life expectancy, was vanquished. It has yet to return. Times are tough in Britain in 2015 for those on their uppers. But they are several bases of tough away from 1875, because in the century up to the 1970s, two political forces that seemed constantly at each other’s throats – social democrats and conservatives – somehow managed, between them, to create or permit, and then sustain, a set of transformative national networks, the essence of the modern state. The water network. The education network. The health network. The postal network. The welfare network. The transport network. The energy network. The networks are still with us, but they are threatened. The heirs to the social democratic and conservative movements have lost sight of the fundamental principle underlying them – that they must be universal. Universal, in the sense society determined that all its members, rich, poor and in between, must have access to them, which means that the better off must pay extra. Which means, in turn, that there must always be some degree of government involvement in running them. Although the British state has taken on many of the old functions of the religious establishment – it makes rules on sexuality, morality, gender, reproduction, marriage, children, free expression and diet, and is chief patron of the arts and sciences – it is the universal networks that the state is most closely identified with. Transport, energy, welfare, education, health: the list pretty much corresponds to the list of portfolios in your typical modern-day government. But after 1979, Margaret Thatcher and her allies called time on the century of universal networks. By destroying the council housing network at the very moment it became universal – when there was a house for pretty much everyone who needed one – the Thatcherites signalled their disdain for the notion of a British community of mutual benefit that might be made both patriotic and modern. The seemingly absurd Thatcherite proposition that you could be a 20th-century British patriot in a society designed as if we still lived in the 18th-century world of Adam Smith, when the only universal networks were the same as in medieval times – defence, the justice system and the production of currency – has been mainstream doctrine for the major parties ever since. The privatisation, disaggregation and foreign takeover of Britain’s universal networks since Thatcher has enabled the great lie of the post-Thatcher era, that tax has fallen, when in reality the tax burden has simply been shifted from progressive taxes on income, where the wealthy pay more, to the flat fees for private universal networks such as water, energy and transport, where the poorer pay more. The original principle of universal networks – that society as a whole would provide a service for everyone, through a levy proportionate to each citizen’s means – has been turned on its head. Where once the well-off paid the lion’s share of building the nation’s sewers and schools and council houses, now it is the less well-off who bear proportionately the greater burden of funding wind farms, new nuclear power stations, broadband coverage in the countryside or London’s gold-plated new super-sewer. Privatise the universal networks – or, in the case of health and education, reconfigure them into a set of autonomous fragments with commercial incentives to oligopolise and chainify – and what remains of government? What is government for? Does it protect, provide, shelter, guide, build? If not, what is a “nation”? These questions should be at the heart of the election campaign. They are not being asked. The half-dozen parties competing for our votes spend their time talking about what government should do. They do not talk about what government should be. The two main parties have different mythologies about how the universal networks came into being. Labour focuses on the creation of the welfare state in the 1940s; Conservatives on the private investors who built the original railways, the early power stations and waterworks, and on charitable hospitals and housing trusts. For Labour, the universality of networks, won by trade unions, strikes, demonstrations and bitter campaigns, was a matter of social justice. For the more enlightened Conservatives and old-style Liberals who bought into it, universality was a matter of efficiency and productivity – healthier workers, literate workers, workers who had electric light, made for better business. “I would ask the political economist who may be disposed to scan this kind of legislation too closely,” said Cross in 1874, “to remember that there is a maxim which is as true of nations as of individuals – that health is actually wealth.” For sure, the British left has traditionally despised its old Tory and Liberal foes for applying the money measure to the welfare of the common man; for sure, the British right has traditionally ridiculed the left for not doing so. But when we look back now at the century of universal networks, the outstanding feature is not the discord, but the result – the harnessing of the resources of businesses and the better-off to light the streets for everyone, educate everyone’s children, heal the sick from every family, get water and power to every home and link every community by roads and railways, to everyone’s benefit, including businesses and the better-off. Whether you call that a victory for social justice, or the prudent investment of a national community, seems beside the point: it happened, and prosperity was spread around. The changing status of internet access is a good example of how a universal network comes about. Access to the internet for regular citizens began as a gimmick and a curiosity that was also, in some sense, a luxury. It then became a useful luxury; transitioned to being simply useful; made the move to being popular; eventually became embarrassing to be without; then difficult to be without. Finally, it has become essential, in the sense that everyone is assumed to have it. If you’re unemployed in Britain today, for instance, you won’t get welfare payments unless you can show you’re applying for seven jobs a day. The only way to do this is online. The internet began as a government project. Non-specialist access to the internet then grew through private companies. Yet once a private, optional network makes the jump to being a universal network, it ceases to be possible for it to belong exclusively to that free-market world. Once society deems that all its members must have constant access to a network, political pressure increases in the drive to make that happen. We can see this, for example, in the way the fervently pro-market British government has leaned on mobile phone companies to pool their competing private networks to provide better coverage, or, in the US, in President Obama’s successful push to have broadband access officially designated as a utility. Delve into the columns of the 19th-century local press, as I did in Cheltenham when I explored the background to the 2004 collapse of Gloucestershire’s water network, and you see a similar process take place with water. First came a state, or public, initiative – in this case, by municipal authorities – to set up a private company to provide water to clean the city streets. Once established, the private water company expanded and offered new services: running water, toilets. The take-up followed the same sequence as with internet access – first water was a gimmicky luxury, then a useful luxury, then just useful, then popular. At this point, political pressure began to build on the water company to become universal – to extend its service to parts of Cheltenham that couldn’t afford it. In the end, after a long struggle, the running water network in Cheltenham did become universal, when enough people realised that making it available to everyone was not simply an act of charity but a means to enrich society as a whole, to the benefit of all. The first universal network was security: the defence of the realm. It was also, because it transcended family and clan interests and involved defining what the realm was, the starting point of the modern state. It is no coincidence that two countries whose armies suffered devastating failures in 2014, Iraq and Ukraine, are among the countries that have been exposed most fiercely to the bad mentoring of outside agents promoting free-market solutions to problems that could only have been solved by the state-led reconstruction of universal networks. Britain has done a lot of charging around the world, advising the governments of countries with less developed networks than our own what to do, with a heavy emphasis on privatisation. Perhaps we could serve the world, and ourselves, better by being a better model; by acknowledging the complex interplay of public and private initiatives, of new ideas and technologies, that created the universal networks in our own country; by finding something good to say about redistributive taxation; and by ceasing to take the failings of our governments as grounds to denigrate the very idea of government. I will be voting Labour. Their freeze on energy bills, their ending of the insanity where state companies from continental Europe can run British trains but a British state company can’t, and their abolition of the bedroom tax and the non-domicile tax loophole are blunt instruments and small. There have been times in the past year when I have heard people ask, apropos of overturning the Tory-Labour hegemony by voting for an insurgent party, “How could things get any worse?” Without denigrating their understandable hostility to the political establishment, it seems a strange question. Not long before the 1875 Public Health Act, cholera claimed 6,600 lives. Cholera; that would be worse. Thousands of migrants are drowning in the Mediterranean or dying in the Sahara trying to reach Europe. Living in a country so corrupt and broken you would risk death to get away from it; that would be worse. Much could be worse. We owe it to our ancestral reformers, and to the next wave of migrants wondering how their countries might be reformed, and to ourselves, to show that things could get better, too. • The new and updated edition of James Meek’s Private Island: Why Britain Now Belongs To Someone Else, shortlisted for the Orwell prize, is out now from Verso at £8.99 rrp.

Here’s the full quote. Ed Miliband will probably go down as one of the worst Labour Party leaders in history. He takes us into a disastrous general election and performs very badly. He bequeaths us this system that clearly doesn’t work. He gives permission to the far left in the party to have the space to develop as they have done. He should apologise for those things. He was critical of people who were trying to push him to be stronger on immigration and welfare. There are so many things he should apologise for. He’s been one of the worst leaders we’ve ever had. The “one of the worst leaders ever” charge is an interesting one, but not normally one that I would have time to pursue. However, by chance there is a book sitting on my desk that makes it possible to shed some light on this. Charles Clarke, the Labour former home secretary, and Toby S James, an academic, have edited British Labour Leaders, which looks at the record of all Labour leaders. It includes a chapter by Clarke in which he measures leaders by how well they did in general elections. The figures are sometimes quite surprising, and will challenge preconceived ideas as to who was best/worst. Clarke looks at the record of all 15 Labour leaders from Keir Hardie in 1906 who fought a general election and he ranks them according to five separate metrics. The full charts are in the book, but here is a simplified version. Looking at these figures, Miliband’s record is mixed; not great, to be sure, but certainly a lot better than Danczuk is suggesting. One figure does come out very badly using this system to evaluate leaders; Gordon Brown. He is near the bottom of most of these charts. In some respects that just shows how flawed this system is a means of evaluating politicians, because Brown also contributed to the success of New Labour when Blair was prime minister but does not get the credit using the Clarke methodology. Will Clarke lose any sleep over this? Probably not. When he and Brown were in cabinet together, they were bitter rivals. Here are the five measures of success. Best by seats gained/lost at an individual general election The two leaders at the top are not surprising, but it may be a shock to some to see Ramsay MacDonald in the top three. The fact that he also comes last, having lost more than 200 seats in 1931, is not unexpected, although it is odd to see Attlee in the bottom three too. He is not normally remembered as a great election loser. On this measure Miliband is in the bottom half, but only just; there were eight elections where Labour lost more seats. Best 1 - Clement Attlee in 1945 - 239 seats gained 2 - Tony Blair in 1997 - 147 seats gained 3 - Ramsay MacDonald in 1929 - 136 seats gained Worst 1 - MacDonald in 1931 - 235 seats lost 2 - Gordon Brown in 2010 - 97 seats lost 3 - Attlee in 1950 - 78 seats lost Best by share of vote gained/lost at an individual general election The early Labour leaders had an advantage on this metric, because this was a time when Labour was emerging from nowhere as a party. Increasing the share of the vote was not that hard. On this measure Miliband’s 2010 performance (where Labour’s share of the vote went up, even though the party lost seats) is roughly in the middle of the table. Best 1 - William Adamson in 1918 - up 14.4% 2 - Attlee in 1945 - up 10% 3 - John Robert Clynes in 1922 - up 8.9% Worst 1 - Michael Foot in 1983 - down 9.3% 2 - Arther Henderson in 1931 - down 6.2% 3 - Brown in 2010 - down 6.2% Best by seats gained/lost in general elections cumulatively (ie, in all elections fought) This is arguably a better measure, because it takes in overall performance. Interestingly, in this table Neil Kinnock (remembered as an election loser) beats Harold Wilson (remembered as a winner). On this measure, Miliband is the fifth worst Labour leader. Best 1 - Attlee - 225 seats gained cumulatively (in five elections) 2 - Clynes - 85 seats gained cumulatively (in one election) 3 - Blair - 84 seats gained cumulatively (in three elections) 4 - Neil Kinnock - 62 seats gained cumulatively (in two elections) 5 - Wilson - 61 seats gained cumulatively (in five elections) Worse 1 - Brown - 97 seats lost (in one election) 2 - MacDonald - 90 seats lost cumulatively (in four elections) 3 - Foot - 60 seats lost (in one election) 4 - Callaghan - 50 seats lost (in one election) 5 - Miliband - 26 seats lost (in one election) Best by share of vote gained/lost in general elections cumulatively (ie, in all elections fought) This is another measure that benefits the early Labour leaders. On this metric, Miliband comes seventh out of 15. Labour’s share of the vote when up 1.5 percentage points in 2015. Best 1 - Adamson - up 14.4% (in one election) 2 - Attlee - up 12.9% cumulatively (in five elections) 3 - Clynes - up 8.9% (in one election) Worst 1 - Foot - down 9.3% (in one election) 2 - Brown - down 6.2% (in one election) 3 - Wilson - down 4.5% cumulatively (in five elections) Best by total votes gained/lost cumulatively (ie, in all elections fought) This measure is interesting because, if you count using this system, Blair emerges as Labour’s second worst leader. That’s because of all those lost votes that people talk about in Labour circles. And Kinnock is the second best Labour leader (because he managed to recover many of those votes lost under Foot.) In this table Miliband comes sixth out of 15. Labour gained more than 700,000 votes in 2015. Best 1 - Attlee - up 5.8m 2 - Kinnock - up 3.1m 3 - MacDonald - up 2.4m Worst 1 - Foot - down 3.1m 2 - Blair - down 2m 3 - Brown - down 900,000 That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The hearing is over. I’m afraid it was a bit of a snoozeathon. It’s no surprise that the live feed crashed so often; even digital technology might have found it a struggle staying awake. Osborne says he expects the OECD to update international corporate tax rules later this year. The plans won’t be perfect, but they will amount to a very substantial reform. Britain and Germany initiated this, he says. Lord Forsyth goes again. Q: You say you will compensate councils from the overseas aid fund for the cost of housing Syrian refugees. Why will that aid be limited to 12 months? Osborne says that is all that is allowed under the rules about what counts as aid spending. Q: Aren’t these rules flawed? Osborne says Britain signed up to spending 0.7% of national income on aid. Over recent weeks the case for that has become stronger. Q: But are the rules sensible? Osborne says, if there were no rules, all countries would claim to be spending 0.7% of their income on aid. Q: What evidence has there been of a change in banking culture? Osborne says there has been a change, but there is more to do. He says the cost of getting things wrong is now phenomenal. So the risks of having a “dodgy trader” are much higher. Q: The minimum wage is calculated to take into account what the employment market can bear. But the living wage is based on what you need to live. How will you ensure that, when tax credits are cut, there are not substantial losers? Osborne says there are several versions of the living wage out there. He followed the approach on George Bain’s approach for the Resolution Foundation, based on 60% of median earnings. He says he has never pretended that decisions on welfare are not difficult. Q: How will you ensure people losing money from the cuts to tax credits have time to get used to their lower income? Osborne says he is proposing a compact to the country. To business, he is saying their taxes will be low, but they have to pay higher wages. And to families he is saying welfare will be less generous, but wages will be higher. He says current welfare spending is unsustainable. Ramping up tax credits in a way that made them unaffordable was irresponsible. Originally they were supposed to cost less than £1bn. But they ended up costing £30bn. Q: How will the social care sector be able to cope with the higher national minimum wage? Osborne says he is aware of this issue. He plans to address it in the spending review. Osborne says there is not a completely free market in energy. The energy has to ensure a reliable energy supply. And it has to address the cost of carbon to the environment. So energy is more expensive than it would be if these factors did not apply. Lord Turnbull goes next. Q: The price you are paying for Hinkley Point is extremely high. And the French are building reactors to this design, but can’t get them to work. It’s going to be a white elephant. Osborne says he is not an expert on the design of nuclear power stations. But the government does not bear the risk. If it does not work, EDF lose out. On the strike price (the guaranteed price for the energy price it will produce), Osborne says it is cheaper than the alternatives. He believes in an energy mix, he says. Osborne says the world can learn from how Britain does public/private partnership. There is a very successful example in London, where there is a £6bn project for new sewers. It involves public and private investment. Q: On nuclear power, are you optimistic that we will get a deal with the Chinese on Hinkley Point, perhaps when the Chinese president visits later this year? Osborne says he is “pretty confident” that there will be a deal, although talks are still going on. EDF is the main partner, but the government is looking to involve the Chinese as a co-investor. I’m following the hearing through the live feed on the parliament website, but it has been crashing a bit. We’re back up now. Osborne is talking about the EU renegotation. He says Britain should be able to stay in a reformed EU where its interests are protected. Other EU countries accept that the system is not working for the non-Eurozone countries as well as for the Eurozone countries. At one of the Greek crisis meetings, a decision was taken by Eurozone countries to use an EU instrument to loan money to Greece. There were no non-Eurozone countries in the room when this was decided. Subsequently he worked hard to ensure that Britain’s interests were protected. But, when he took this up with the commission, he was told that, under qualified majority voting, the non-Eurozone countries did not need to be consulted because the Eurozone countries had a majority. This is a key issue in the renegotiation, he says. Osborne says it is unfair to give people in council homes the right to buy, but not people in housing association homes. That is a “public sector anomaly”, he says. He is correcting it. Q: How will you ensure that there is one-to-one replacement? Osborne says that detail is coming. It will be in the legislation. Essentially, money from the sales, plus money from the sale of expensive council housing stock, will fund extra homes. Lord Forsyth, the former Conservative cabinet minister, goes next. Q: Are you worried about the impact that interest rate rises will have on people? Osborne says the governor of the Bank of England has said that, when rates rise, their peak will be lower than in previous interest rate cycles. Lord Turnbull, the crossbencher and former cabinet secretary, say he thinks Osborne is putting too much emphasis on reducing debt. Osborne says he does not agree. Back to the Lords, where Osborne says he is determined to keep the Bank of England independent. He does not know what would happen under other parties, he says, in a jibe at Jeremy Corbyn. My colleague Rowena Mason says Labour have had to call the police about a protest outside their HQ - involving just two people. Stefan and Paul travelled to Labour HQ in London from Bristol to protest about being denied a vote in the leadership election, accusing the party of rigging the contest against Jeremy Corbyn. Labour officials called the police on them (and three Met officers arrived, outnumbering the protesters). The party then sent an email to all its staff restricting access to its HQ. The Labour peer Lord Layard goes next. Q: Would you agree that the deficit did not contribute to the financial crash? And why are you pursuing a contractory policy? Osborne says that when he became chancellor, the deficit was extremely high. The deficit is now almost 5%. If it were not for the fact that it used to be around 11%, people would be worried about that. If you cannot cut it when the economy is doing well, when can you cut it? He says his opponents seem unwilling to cut the deficit in any circumstances; either the economy is too strong for it to be necessary, or too weak, they say. Osborne says the M25 and the Channel Tunnel were both bitterly opposed by MPs. Each general has a responsibility to take big, controversial decisions to review our infrastructure, he says. HS2 is the choice for this generation. George Osborne, the chancellor, has just started giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. They start with HS2. Q: HS2 is due to cost about £56bn in today’s money. What will you do to cut the costs? George Osborne says he is a stronger believer in the project. Big infrastructure projects are always controversial. But, over 25 years, we can afford it. He says French high-speed rail construction is a lot cheaper. He has asked HS2 to look at the reasons for this. He is told that it is because property rights are stronger here, and compensation is higher. And that’s it. The opening speeches are over. Yvette Cooper has performed well during the refugee crisis and she put in another good performance today. I would not go quite as far as her Labour colleague Jack Dromey ... ... but it was certainly a very fine speech. Cooper challenges May to say how many refugees Britain will take in the first year. May says she cannot put a figure on that. It would not be right to put a figure on this, she says. It is more important to ensure that the right support is in place. That is why she cannot commit to a figure now. Cooper says Britain may be helping to fund assessment centres in Greece. But what happens after those assessments have been carried out? Why won’t Britain take refugees from Greece? May says every county in Europe is contributing in its own way. Britain is not part of the relocation in Europe scheme, but it is helping in other ways. Yvette Cooper intervenes. Can May give any good reasons why the UK won’t take refugees from Greece? May says Cooper implied in her speech that the UK was not working with other countries in Europe. But it is. It is already providing help to Greece. May says the amount the UK is spending helping refugees from Syria in refugee camps is almost as much as the rest of the EU put together. Without British aid to these camps, the number of people attempting the “perilous” journey to the UK would be even higher. Theresa May, the home secretary, is speaking now. She says the scenes we have seen have been harrowing. The government is doing everything it can, she says. Alex Salmond, the Scottish foreign affairs spokesman and former Scottish first minister, asks if the government has plans to help people not in refugee camps. May says the government does accept asylum claims from people in the UK. It will consider those claims. Cooper is winding up now. In the 1680s 50,000 Huguenots fled here from La Rochelle.Two hundred years later, 140,000 Russians fled here from the Czar. And in the 30s, despite the recession and hardship our country faced we took in over 80,000 Jewish and European refugees. And this is a challenge to us in Parliament, not just to our government – it’s not just on them. And she quotes what David Grenfell, a Labour MP, said at the end of the debate about taking Jewish refugees in 1938. He said: The House this evening has shown a wonderful unanimity of sentiment and feeling, which must gladden the hearts of members in all parts of the House. Within the framework of a feeling of common humanity and a common standard of civilisation members in all parts of the House have filled in a picture which shows the House of Commons at its very best. We are at the turning of roads.. We could never set our hands to a better thing. Tomorrow may be a hard day for us but I feel that by doing the things that are morally right we shall achieve something which is worthy of the name of the British nation. Cooper concludes: Let’s be the House of Commons at our best. Let’s live up to our predecessors. Let’s live up to our history. Let’s live up to the generosity of the country we seek to represent. Let’s decide this week we will do more to help. Cooper says the government’s proposal implies 4,000 refugees over the next 12 months. We should take more over the next 12 months, she says. But she says it is hard to put a figure on how many people we should take over the whole parliament. That needs to be kept under review. Cooper says she agrees with the government that Britain should not take part in an EU-run quota system. But that does not mean Britain should turn its back, she says. Cooper says 7,000 Syrians arrived in Macedonia on Monday alone. And they are arriving in other countries too. She is particularly worried about Greece, she says. Cooper says, as well as disagreeing with the government over numbers, she disagrees with the decision not to take refugees from Europe. The government wants to stop them coming to Europe, she says. But this argument does not apply, because people are fleeing already. Cooper says May should spend the next month working on a plan to show how many refugees could actually take. Cooper says Cameron’s 20,000 figures amounts to 4,000 a year. But that compares to the 10,000 Jewish children who came to Britain in the late 1930s under the kindertransport programme. She says she said Britain could take 10,000 people straight away by considering how many refugees local councils could take. Has Theresa May asked councils how many people they could accept? She says almost 4,000 people have offered to open their homes to refugees. Cooper says the government’s programme to take vulnerable Syrians from refugee camps has only taken 200 people. She welcomes the fact that the government says it will take 20,000 people. That shows that the government can be made to change its mind. Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks Cooper if she agrees on the need to avoid policy that turns Europe into a “magnet” for those who will put their lives at risk crossing the Mediterranean. Cooper says she will address that in her speech. Cooper says there is a difference between immigration and asylum. The issues around immigration should not stop us doing our bit to help the refugee crisis, she says. She says many of the refugees are fleeing a new totalitarianism. Labour agrees that Britain should be helping those in refugee camps. She applauds the fact that Britain is doing more than other countries. She agrees that the navy should be contributing to search and rescue, and that action should be taken about people smugglers. And it is right to help orphaned children. She says Theresa May should clarify whether or not Syrian children will be sent home when they reach the age of 18. That would he inhumane, she says. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says we must not be hard-hearted, but we must be hard-headed. Will Labour say how many refugees it would take? Cooper says helping refugees is a hard-headed response. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is opening the emergency debate on the refugee crisis. She says that parliament was united in 1938 when it held an emergency debate on taking Jewish refugees from Germany. But yesterday, when David Cameron made his statement, the Commons was not united. Europe is facing a refugee crisis, she says. Number 10 has revealed that the legal advice that approved the RAF drone strike that killed two British Islamic State terrorists was drawn up “some months ago”. But the attack only took place on 21 August. The revelation came as David Cameron came under pressure to publish the legal advice he received from the attorney general, Jeremy Wright. Humza Yousaf, the SNP MSP and the Scottish government’s international development minister, said: If it were truly an act of self-defence it would be helpful for the UK government to share the intelligence behind that, if that is sharing it with party leaders or sharing it with parliament. The democratic will of the parliament was not to have military intervention in Syria when this was brought to the parliament a couple of years ago, and that parliamentary will has been ridden roughshod over so we need the reasons why. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, made the same point. Labour and the SNP are also calling upon the government to let parliament’s intelligence and security committee (which has not been reformed yet since the election) to carry out an inquiry into the attack. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has said that the government is prepared to carry out further drone strikes against British jihadis in Syria. The father of two young men believed to be fighting alongside Islamic State in Syria has said he fears they could also be on a British government “hit list”. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative Eurosceptic MP, has said that most members of his party will vote to leave the EU in the upcoming referendum. In an interview on Today, he also called for the party’s central office to remain neutral in the campaign. The Conservative minister Ros Altmann has been expelled from the Labour party after it was discovered she had been a member for more than 18 months. Michael Gove has taken the first steps in his plans to introduce an “earned release” scheme for prisoners in England and Wales by announcing a major review of education provisions in jails. Leaders of some of Britain’s biggest charities have admitted to MPs they failed to spot growing public concern about fund-raising activities carried out on their behalf by agencies. As the Press Association reports, the charities were summoned to parliament by Commons public administration committee following a spate of scandals over donors receiving floods of letters and phone calls demanding money, as well as data from people who have given to charity being passed on to other organisations. Bernard Jenkin, the committee chairman, told the charity chiefs it appeared that “the temptation to raise money made you slipshod in your governance procedures or wilfully blind to what was going on”. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless accepted there had been “gross excesses” and told MPs on the committee: “I think that there has been an imbalance between the desire to raise money and the importance of valuing the relationship with donors, whether potential or actual.” Oxfam’s chief executive Mark Goldring said: “I think we got into this situation by placing too much reliance on agencies with too little supervision.” Number 10 has said that the legal advice approving the drone strike that killed the two British Islamic State recruits was issued “some months ago”. In a Guardian article yesterday Joshua Rozenberg explained why he thought the drone attack that killed the two British Islamic State recruits in Syria was lawful. Today, in a Financial Times article, another legal expert, David Allen Green says he has his doubts. Here’s an extract. When someone is killed by state action “who deserves it” then it is always tempting to convert one’s normative view into a positive statement that the death was lawful. But for me, the legal problem with the killing of Reyaad Khan is that to invoke Article 51 of the Charter is to perhaps push “self defence” beyond the limits of elasticity. Article 51 is not a general “licence to kill” terrorists on sight wherever in the world they may be found – a “licence” here meaning something which permits an action which would otherwise be unlawful. Some may say that the UK government should have such a licence to kill; but that is not what the law actually says. For me, this killing prompts various questions. What are the limits of “self defence” when faced with international terrorism? Is the contention that any preemptive attack can be justified if the target is a terrorist? When does “self defence” simply merge with a “shoot to kill” policy? In 1988 the UK government sanctioned the killing of three IRA terrorists in Gibraltar. It must have seemed a good idea to the UK government at the time; but under scrutiny the UK government’s account of what happened unravelled. Indeed, the UK government (and the security and police forces) do not have a great track record when pleading “terrorism” when killing people. There is a good reason why life and death should not depend on the executive’s fiat. On the Today programme Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative Eurosceptic MP, said that he thought his party should stay “neutral” in the EU referendum. In an interview about last night’s defeat, he said he was “startled” to learn the Conservative HQ was planning to campaign actively in favour of staying in. In my view the Conservative party is divided on the European question, and therefore should be neutral. And the Conservative central party office should not be used as a campaigning instrument in the referendum. I hazard a guess, but most Conservative party members will be voting to leave the EU in this referendum. I have little doubt about that. Jenkin also got involved in a mini row with James Naughtie, the presenter, after he accused the BBC of “unintentional cultural bias” in its EU coverage. Here is a Guardian video of Michael Fallon saying there could be more British drone strikes against Islamic State terrorists in Syria. An ORB poll for the Independent suggests that Jeremy Corbyn is seen as the Labour leadership candidate most likely to harm Labour’s chances at the next election. It also suggests that Andy Burnham would do most to improve Labour’s prospects. A spokesman for the Burnham campaign said: “This is the eighth poll of the general public - the people who will decide whether Labour wins in 2020 - that shows Andy Burnham as the candidate to improve our electoral chances.” Michael Gove, the new justice secretary, clearly still hankers a bit after his old job. He has just announced a review of adult education in prison. There are details in this written statement. The review will be chaired by Dame Sally Coates, who runs academies for United Learning. It will cover “how we can significantly improve education for all prisoners”, as well as “how the quality and methods of prison teaching can be improved including in classrooms and workshops, how prisoners can be encouraged to positively engage with learning and the potential for employers to advise on the curriculum to ensure that prisons offer the right courses and qualifications to enable prisoners to secure jobs on release”. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism says that, following the statement yesterday from David Cameron, it is now known that at least 10 Britons have been killed by American or British drones since 2008. The total could be as high as 20, it says. The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake says he is trying to get John Bercow to grant an urgent question on the legality of the use of drone strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria. Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader in Westminster, is using an article in the Telegraph today to urge the government to think twice before asking MPs to vote in favour of military strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Syria. The DUP voted against military action in Syria in 2013 (when the proposed target was President Assad’s forces, not Isis), and Dodds says the DUP will vote against the government again over Syria unless it provides a much better explanation as to what air strikes might achieve. Here’s an extract. Unionist MPs, to put it mildly, are hardly opposed to the use of British military force abroad or at home in pursuit of the national interest. Yet this brings us to the heart of where George Osborne is so mistaken. For what have the wars he has supported so much in the last decade done? Simply this: the imprudent use of British force has put the public off using it at all. The direct result of having intervened where we shouldn’t is that there is no longer any public support for intervening when we should. There is a lesson here for Blairites in all parties. In Labour, if the mistakes involved in Afghanistan and Iraq had been faced up to, that party might not now be in the sorry state it is. In the Tory Party, MPs like John Baron and Gerald Howarth likewise are right to understand what’s in the UK’s interest, and how best we can then do good in the world. A vague, promiscuous vote in the House of Commons next week authorising, for example, armed force in Syria would not achieve that end. And unless the government in a very short space of time provides much more detailed proposals, I would expect again to be voting alongside the likes of Mr Baron and Sir Gerald. Here are the key points from Michael Fallon’s Today interview. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, said that the government “would not hesitate” to order more further drone strikes against British jihadis in Syria. We wouldn’t hesitate to do it again if we know there’s an armed attack that is likely, if we know who’s involved in it then we have to do something about it. He said the government had identified “a number” of Islamic State (Isis) terrorists in Syria who could be future targets. (See 8.58am.) He said the drone strike that killed the two Britons was taken to stop an armed attack being planned for the future, not just as a consequence of the attacks reportedly planned for the VE Day commemorations 10 May and Armed Forces Day on 27 June. Both those events took place before the drone strike on 21 August. Asked about this, Fallon said: I’m not going to go into details of which specific public event or attack was involved here. These were terrorist who’d been planning a series of attacks on the streets of our country, some involving public events, there were other terrorist making similar plans and we have to do what we can to keep our streets safe. Imagine the outcry if we’d known an attack like this was likely and it then took place and it transpired we had done nothing to prevent it. He said the Britons killed in the drone attack were “directly involved” with people in the UK planning attacks. He would not say whether anyone had been arrested in the UK in connection with the armed attack planned for the future. He said that the government wanted permission to bomb Isis targets in Syria and that parliament would get the chance to vote on this. At some point the new parliament will have to rethink the absurdity of us being able to strike against Isil (Isis) in Iraq, but not being able to strike Isil’s command and control centres in north eastern Syria ... But to get parliamentary approval we have to be absolutely sure that we would win the vote, that we would establish a sufficient majority for it. Last time we asked parliament, parliament actually turned this down. He said that, although parliament did not approve air strikes against Isis targets in Syria when this was last debated, David Cameron reserved the right to order an attack in an emergency. We don’t have general permission to carry out military operations in Syria but, at the time of the debate last year, the prime minister made it extremely clear that, where there was a vital national interests at stake, we wouldn’t hesitate to take action rather than seek prior permission, to take action and then come and explain to parliament afterwards and that’s exactly what happened yesterday. He said unmanned aircraft (drones) still had pilots, and that they had to follow “very clear” rules of engagement. (But MPs have not had much success trying to find out exactly what these say.) He also said the pilots were based in the UK. He said that Cameron effectively did present MPs with a summary of the legal advice he received justifying the attack in his statement yesterday. I’ve taken some of the quotes from PoliticsHome. Here is the key passage from Michael Fallon’s Today interview. It’s the one where he confirms that more jihadis - and not just “two or three” - could be targeted by RAF drones in Syria. James Naughtie was interviewing him. MF: There are other terrorists in involved in other plots that may come to fruition over the next few weeks and months and we would not hesitate to take similar action again. JN: So there is a list of names that you’ve got of people who are involved, you believe, in planning activity in this country and if you find out where they are you will go for them in the way that you did in this case. MF: Well, the list is the other way round. There are a group of people who have targets in our country who are planning armed attacks on our streets, or planning to disrupt major public events in this country, and our job, to keep us safe, is with the security agencies to identify who they are, to track them down and, if there is no other way of preventing these attacks, then, yes, we will authorise strikes like we did. JN: So, just to go back to this point, you know of individuals who are planning attacks, you know that they are in Syria, you know who they are, and if you find out where they are, you will attack them? MF: If we have no other way of preventing an armed attack that is likely to take place in our streets other than using a military strike to prevent it, then that’s what we will do. JN: And how many people are in that category, roughly speaking? MF: Well, I don’t want to go into numbers and details, I’m afraid, in public, but there are a number of terrorists out there in Syria, based in and around Raqqa, Isil’s headquarters, who are actively involved in planning attacks on our streets, who’ve been planning attacks on the streets of Australia and on the streets of the United States. So it is more than just the individuals that have been the subject of this strike. JN: Would it be right to infer that we are not just talking about two or three, we are talking about more? MF: Yes. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and he has just finished one on the Today programme. He did not formally announce that the government has a “kill list” (to use the term developed in America, where President Obama chairs regular meetings to decide which jihadi will be targeted for assassination by US drones), but he made it pretty clear that there is one sitting in Whitehall somewhere. Here are the key points. Michael Fallon indicated that more jihadis in Syria could be attacked by RAF drones. He said he would not hesitate to authorise the drone attack that killed the two Britons in Syria again. He indicated that he favoured Britain taking part in air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Syria and that MPs would have the chance to vote on this again. I will post full quotes from Fallon’s interviews shortly. And, as usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.

None: they didn't have electricity. As jokes go, it's appalling. As a prospect for daily existence, life without power is infinitely worse. Today, UK homeowners expect flick-of-a-switch access to energy. It keeps our houses warm, our fridges cold and our lights illuminated. Yet where does our power come from? How does it reach us? And why is it becoming so expensive? Consuming energy People talk about the UK's \"energy mix\", which makes it sound a convoluted affair. In fact, we get our domestic energy from one of two sources: electricity (23% of total energy consumption) and gas (68%). Most of us use electricity to power things, and gas to heat things (water and heating systems, in the main) – although electric boilers and the like demonstrate that the lines can and do often blur. The remaining 9% of domestic energy comes mostly from oil and solid fuels such as wood and housecoal. The reduction in coal as a base source of energy marks one of the biggest shifts in the UK power market over recent decades. In 1970, a whopping 39% of household energy came from coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Today the figure is less than 1%. Another change is our consumption of energy. According to the latest government figures, UK householders collectively get through around 43m tonnes of oil a year. Thanks to better insulation and other energy efficiencies, individual UK homeowners use 12% less energy now than in 1990. The downside is that there are now more homes, meaning energy consumption overall has gone up by 6% in real terms over the same period. Making energy Where things start getting more complicated is when we switch to how we get our electricity and gas. For natural gas, it's easy. The stuff piped into your homes is, bar some sophisticated tampering in the treatment phase, essentially the same as the stuff that comes out of the ground. Electricity is a different ballgame altogether. Short of tapping an electric storm, natural electricity is difficult to come by. We need to generate it, which is where the \"mix\" comes in. Interestingly, the main options – coal, gas, and nuclear – have not changed much over the last four decades. Coal tops the list, much to the continued chagrin of environmentalists. In 2012, it accounted for over a third (36.3%) of the electricity produced by UK power plants. It's not all plain sailing for coal, though. Coal-fired power stations face tough EU reduction targets on sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions. Failure to hit the target deadline, which is next year, is expected to see more than 6 gigawatts of coal capacity forced to close. Gas (26.8%) and nuclear (19.8%) feed the bulk of the UK's remaining power stations (although a number run off gas and coal combined). Again, the goalposts could move. If a rush for unconventional \"shale\" gas materialises, then expect more electricity to be gas-generated in the coming years. As for nuclear, all bar one of the UK's 16 nuclear power stations are set for retirement over the next decade. Replacing the country's ageing nuclear stock is hugely costly and politically contentious, as debate around the proposed £16bn Hinckley Point nuclear power station reveals. Renewables such as solar, hydro and wind continue to valiantly struggle at the bottom of the list. That said, clean electricity's contribution to UK power generation is growing fast, reaching 14.8% last year, up from 11.3% in 2012 and 9.4% in 2011. Even so, the figure will have to jump to 30% by 2020 if the UK is to meet its renewable obligations under EU law, according to the government's own projections. Likewise, renewable heating will need to increase to 12%, up from around 2% today. Sourcing energy The majority of our electric power carries a \"made in Britain\" sticker, bar a fraction that we import from France and The Netherlands (4%). But the story of the fuel stocks burned (or \"fissioned\", in the case of nuclear) in our power stations is a very different matter. Take coal: over the last six decades, the number of coalmines in the UK has decreased by 97% leading to an \"all time low\" domestic production figure of 17m tonnes in 2012. That saw the UK importing an additional 45m tonnes – the bulk of which (89%) is steam coal, used mainly by electricity generators. The UK does better off for gas, although production in the North Sea is in general decline [see Oil &amp; Gas UK graph]. Even so, the UK managed to produce just over 32m tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) last year. With national gas demand running at 67 mtoe, however, the UK has a sizeable import requirement. As for nuclear, the UK has been self-sufficient in conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reprocessing and waste treatment from the outset. Again, with no domestic uranium reserves, the country is dependent on overseas supply. Within the energy mix, renewables are unique in being fully sourced and produced locally. The UK boasts a number of large-scale renewable facilities, such as commercial wind farms and hydroelectric schemes. Plans for the country's first commercial tidal project are also underway. Yet much of the UK's clean energy capacity is ultra-local, coming in the form of household photovoltaic panels, micro-wind turbines, biomass boilers and the like. Pricing energy After a substantial period of relative decline, the price of gas and electricity has begun to creep up over the last decade or so. And the pace appears to be accelerating. Between 2010 and 2013, UK energy prices shot up 37%, eight times the rate of earnings. The average annual electricity bill for UK homeowners came in at £776 last year, up by £57 on 2012. So why the spike? According to a UK parliamentary report, much of the blame lies with increases in wholesale costs. Exacerbating the trend upward are higher operating, network and environmental costs. The UK's major energy providers, known as \"the big six\", are quick to join the government in pointing the finger at the rising cost of wholesale prices, particularly in the case of imports. But are these six powerful companies also responsible? Consumer rights' group Which? has long argued that the UK's large energy providers employ \"practices that unfairly increase costs\" as well as over-complicating pricing structures and switching policies. Last month's announcement of a review into of the UK energy market by Ofgem, the sector's regulator, suggests the concerns of consumer groups are being heard. But the prospects for reducing household energy bills in the short-term look slim. The UK has little influence over wholesale prices and seemingly little immediate intention to reduce imports. \"In the medium to long term the pressures on price all appear to be upwards,\" the report authors conclude. Their advice to homeowners is equally blunt: \"The only way for most consumers to reduce the impact of increased unit costs, and even to reduce their bills, is through energy-efficiency improvements.\" This article is part of the Guardian's #bigenergydebate series.

Despite a currency that makes their goods a third cheaper than two years ago, they have failed to shift much in the way of extra kit. Making matters worse, the government's attempts to stimulate domestic demand have sparked an imports binge. Set against the lacklustre export figures, the rise in imports amounts to a drag on GDP. To run through the figures, exports grew by 0.4% on the previous quarter. For an economy the size of Japan's, that could appear impressive, but it only makes up some of the 0.7% fall in the previous quarter. Then add to the mix a 3.5% jump in imports, which followed a 2.4% increase in the third quarter. Looking underneath these figures, there is even more cause for concern. Exporters are hoarding profits rather than increasing production. To shareholders that might seem like a good move after several years of low profits or even losses at the big electronics firms. But to a government that has worked hard to support business, it is a kick in the teeth. Exporters can blame the China slowdown, a soft patch in US growth and the continuing difficulties in the eurozone. And though there is little change in Europe and the US, the scale of the difficulties in China, a big market for Japanese goods, is underplayed in the western media, according to many analysts. The silver lining is a rise in investment spending. Yet for all their bluster, they should be exploiting the low value of the yen to greater effect. Meanwhile a rise in consumer confidence following a stimulus package that includes a 5.5 trillion yen boost this year has encouraged spending on Apple iPhones more than Sony PlayStations. This situation may reverse should capital investment pay dividends. However, there is a longer term problem relating to energy imports. As the country recovers and grows, it must suck in liquefied natural gas, oil and coal by the boat load. With only one of its 52 nuclear power stations in operation, and no date set for them to restart, this situation looks like it will continue for some time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/jun/24/nigel-farage-ukip-voters-greater-voice-referendums","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-23T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Nigel Farage wants to give voters a greater voice by extending referendums","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/24/nigel-farage-ukip-voters-greater-voice-referendums","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/jun/24/nigel-farage-ukip-voters-greater-voice-referendums","fields":{"headline":"Nigel Farage wants to give voters a greater voice by extending referendums","bodyText":"Nigel Farage has said that his party will be an advocate of direct democracy by giving voters the power in a referendum to block local housing, environmental or transport schemes. He also said he wanted voters to be given a more direct say in foreign affairs issues, arguing that Swiss-style referendums can bind countries together. In his first setpiece speech since his party's successes in the European elections, the Ukip leader also said he supported direct recall, whereby MPs charged with misconduct can be answerable to their voters. The government is introducing a recall mechanism, but critics, including Farage, claim the hurdle before voters can demand a constituency referendum (10% of voters) is too high and is set by MPs themselves. Addressing the Institute for Government, Farage said \"the political class has got to realise they are public servants and the public are in charge\" . He also questioned why wider referendums in the UK have been largely confined to constitutional issues, such as the future of the voting system, relationship with the European Union the creation of national and regional assemblies and whether to have elected mayors. A referendum can also be held if a local authority proposes to increase council tax by more than 3%. He questioned why electorates can restrain council tax, but \"not major planning decisions that can completely change the character and and shape of the environment\". Asked in what circumstances he envisaged a referendum being held, the Ukip leader said people should be able to call a vote \"to stop something from happening\" to which they objected. He suggested this could be triggered if 5% of the electorate – about 2.3 million people – signed a petition over a fixed period of time, such as four to six months. He claimed \"frivolous causes and ideas won't generate the organisation, media attention or money to secure enough petition signatures within a set time\". There would have to be a \"big diversion of views\" on a major issue for there to be a referendum, he added, to ensure that a vote was not called frivolously \"every Thursday\". He said \"I see direct democracy working as a valuable safety net when the political class have got too far out of touch with political opinion. \"By giving people the chance to call a major national referendum or sack a rotten MP, people might feel more empowered and more favourable to government and what they are doing.\" On recall, Farage said the \"bar would have to be set at the right level\" for a byelection to be triggered for a sitting MP to ensure that any process was not \"open to abuse\". He admitted direct democracy could lead to risks on policy areas such as nuclear power but, he said, it was a risk worth taking. Ukip had always been a supporter of small government, he added, arguing that in 1940, when Britain was facing its greatest crisis and at the outset of a long and arduous war, the government had only nine cabinet ministers; the figure now is closer to 30, he said. Farage also set out ideas to reduce government spending, including simplifying the tax code and reducing the foreign aid budget. He also promised to reform the appointments, funding and powers on quangos. He said arm's length bodies have been used as a way to reward members of the political class. Such tsars, he said, are ministers' personal choices. \"They are drawn from a narrow circle, because ministers choose who they know or know of,\" he said. \"They are not diverse – 85% are male, 98% are white, 71% aged over 50, 38% have titles. Despite the label tsar, officially these people are called advisers, advocates, ambassadors, chairs, champions, commissioners, coordinators, envoys, representatives, reviewers, the most common by far.\" He said such people are not subject to democratic scrutiny in either their work or the manner of their appointment. He also questioned why some non-governmental organisations such as Greenpeace and Oxfam have relationship far too close to government. Decrying what he described as fake charities, he said any charity that received more in government funding than public donations is not a genuine charity, but an arm of the state. He revealed that he is nervous about involvement of private companies in delivering public services, saying he regarded himself as a traditionalist in terms of the relationship between business and government. He also said as part of devolution he would like to see English-only days in the House of Commons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/17/japan-nuclear-south-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-17T15:29:40Z","webTitle":"While Japan turns away from nuclear power, South Korea sticks to its path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/17/japan-nuclear-south-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/17/japan-nuclear-south-korea","fields":{"headline":"While Japan turns away from nuclear power, South Korea sticks to its path","bodyText":"The traffic lights are still blinking in Odaka town, north-western Japan, but few cars pass through these deserted intersections. Frozen in time after being hit by the triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and meltdowns in the nearby Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear plant, tables are still laid in partially-collapsed restaurants and cars are stacked up against railings where they were deposited by the retreating wave. When I visited last week, a deathly silence reigned, the only noise the chirruping of frogs in uncultivated rice paddies on the edge of town, and the bleeping of my dosimeter. Radiation readings in Odaka are well below anything that could be considered a health risk, but people are still not coming back. Indeed, the long shadow cast by Fukushima has extended over a much wider area than any scientific assessment of radiological hazard would argue is necessary. In Minamisoma, 20km north of the stricken reactor, a community centre above the town is decked out for indoor play because no one wants to let their children venture out of doors. The parents refuse to believe that radiation readings are low enough – barely above normal background, on my dosimeter – that their children's health would be improved by letting them play outside in the fresh air. Watching the kids cooped up in a big wooden hall, I could only conclude that unnecessary fear of radiation is just as much a hazard as the real thing. On a wider scale still, unnecessary fear of radiation now presents a serious hazard to the world's climate. Japan's precipitous exit from nuclear power generation – the day I arrived in Tokyo was the first non-nuclear day in Japan for 42 years – has pushed the country's fossil fuel demand through the roof, with imports of oil and gas up by more than 100% since last year, their ballooning cost driving a record trade deficit of $32bn. As carbon emissions rise in lockstep, Japan's leaders are now backing off from their international climate change commitments, which the country has no chance of meeting. Given that wind, solar and geothermal account for less than 1% of Japan's electricity generation, the country will be massively dependent on fossil fuels for decades to come if the reactors stay switched off. The only alternative is blackout. Given the trauma of the March 2011 tsunami disaster, Japan's nuclear shutdown is understandable – if regrettable from a global warming perspective. But a flight across the Sea of Japan to its neighbour South Korea shows a very different model in evidence. In the same week that Japan mothballed its very last reactor, Korea broke ground on two new-build nuclear power stations – a pair of APR-1400 units now being constructed at Shin Ulchin, on the east coast. They are two of eight new stations planned to add to the country's existing nuclear fleet of 23, currently supplying 45% of the nation's electricity. To mark the occasion the country's president, Lee Myung-bak, paid a visit to the site, praising a \"huge milestone\" for South Korea's engineers, who had helped the country achieve \"the dream of independent nuclear technology\". It is not that South Korea is not green. In fact the mantra of \"green growth\" has been a central component of President Lee's policy platform since 2008, and this month – even as Japan backed away from its own climate commitments – Korea's legislature unanimously passed a new climate act which will enforce carbon caps and an emissions trading scheme among its heavy industry and electricity sector. The country's international carbon emissions target is for a 30% cut below \"business as usual\" emissions by 2020, a commitment its leaders say they intend to deliver on. It also spent a higher proportion of its post-economic crash stimulus package on environmental initiatives than any other country. South Korea is anxious to export its green growth model to other countries. Last week President Lee spoke at a landmark summit held by the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute, reiterating his view that there need be no automatic trade-off between rapid economic growth and environmental sustainability. In respect of Japanese sensitivities, he refrained from addressing the centrality of nuclear to Korea's green growth plans, but tension between the competing visions for what counts as \"green\" were evident throughout the two-day meeting. The president was immediately followed by the Japanese telecoms billionaire Masayoshi Son, who – having reinvented himself as head of the new Japan Renewable Energy Foundation – dramatically declared that there should be \"no nuclear for mankind anywhere in the world, for the sake of the future, for the sake of our children, for the Earth\". The Korean hosts clapped politely, but did not appear convinced – hardly surprising given that Masayoshi Son's only proposed alternative to nuclear generation was a scheme for a pan-Asian supergrid linking Japanese cities with thousands of solar and wind plants supposedly to be built across the Gobi desert in faraway Mongolia. The plan would cost trillions and take decades to implement – and would leave Japan dependent on power lines crossing its energy-hungry and often less-than-friendly neighbour China. Koreans know that their economic miracle has been built on practical engineering success, not magical thinking. The chair of the Green Growth Institute, Dr Han Seung-soo, himself a former prime minister of Korea, told me later: \"Once the safety aspect is guaranteed there is no cleaner source than nuclear. It is clean energy because the amount of emissions created is almost nil.\" When I asked if Korea had a target for wind and solar deployment, he shook his head. Looking out of the window, from the centre of an Asian megacity with impressive skyscrapers in every direction as far as the eye could see, the idea of powering Seoul with renewables did seem nonsensical. The truth is that, as in Japan, the proportion of solar and wind on the Korean grid is tiny, about 0.25% – most of the country's power comes from coal, and the only way to reduce its carbon emissions significantly is to continue to replace coal plants with nuclear. Yet as the post-Fukushima anti-nuclear hysteria continues to drag many countries – from Japan to Germany to Switzerland – back towards the fossil fuels age, South Korea is quietly getting on with reducing its carbon emissions while continuing its growth miracle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2014/may/14/fingerprints-vein-pattern-scan-atm","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-14T13:46:47Z","webTitle":"Forget fingerprints – banks are starting to use vein patterns for ATMs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/14/fingerprints-vein-pattern-scan-atm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/may/14/fingerprints-vein-pattern-scan-atm","fields":{"headline":"Forget fingerprints – banks are starting to use vein patterns for ATMs","bodyText":"Cash machine cards may become a thing of the past following the launch of new hi-tech ATMs which let users withdraw money simply by pressing their finger on an infra-red reader that identifies them from the unique pattern of veins in their hand. Poland has become the first country in Europe to introduce a network of \"finger vein ID\" cash machines, with 2,000 of the new ATMs opening in bank branches and supermarkets across the country this year, backed by a marketing campaign that promises \"cash within your finger\". A person's finger effectively becomes the \"chip\" on a conventional bank card, as the infra-red device reads the unique vein pattern just below the skin surface of a finger or the back of a hand. But although the technology has become commonplace in Japan, where it was first developed, banks in Britain say it could be years before they appear on UK high streets. Some Japanese banks also use the technology as a security measure which allows – or prevents – customers from accessing safety deposit boxes in branches. Its proponents claim it is more accurate than fingerprinting devices, and as reliable as iris-reading technology. Hitachi Europe, which is behind the Polish ATMs, stressed that it is not about reading fingerprints. \"Near-infra-red light is transmitted through the finger and partially absorbed by haemoglobin in the veins to capture a unique finger vein pattern profile, which is then matched with a pre-registered profile to verify individual identity,\" it says. The experts say that vein recognition is a more secure technology than fingerprint scanning, with the readers incorporating a \"liveness\" detection feature to ensure that a real hand is presented. That might also assuage macabre concerns that thieves would hack off a person's finger to ransack cash from their bank account. The infra-red readers are cheaper than iris scans, but there are concerns that with the technology at a relatively early stage of development, no one knows what will happen to veins as people age. According to Hitachi, whose European headquarters are in Maidehead, Berkshire, vein patterns are established in the womb and are remarkably stable throughout the rest of a person's life. Spokesman Pete Jones said: \"They are a physiological feature that is established in the mother's womb. As the person grows, they remain the same. Even if someone becomes very overweight, all that happens is that the pattern scales up. We have been researching this technology for 15 years and found it to be very stable.\" Vein-reading technology is already in use outside of financial services. In the US, nuclear power and biohazard plants have installed vein readers, while it has been reported that some casinos have installed the readers to protect their cash rooms. Airlines are also considering using them as a new type of boarding pass. Some devices combine a fingerprint scan with a check on the person's veins. Will British holidaymakers hoping to take out cash abroad find themselves blocked? The ATM makers say they will continue to have traditional chip-and-pin readers where customers can access their cash in the traditional way. A spokeswoman for Lloyds Bank, which has the biggest number of current account holders in the UK, said: \"We have no plans to adopt this technology at the moment.\" Link, which runs the biggest network of ATMs in the UK, said: \"The use of biometrics as authentication for ATM transactions is a very interesting development, and one we're keeping a close eye on in the UK. ATMs are always evolving and although this is not a technology currently under development for the UK, there's nothing to say we won't see it in future.\" One reason why biometric ID devices have taken off faster in emerging markets (Turkey and Russia have also introduced vein-reading ATMs) than in the developed world is that their launch presents numerous legal and ethical challenges over the storing and use of biometric data."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2014/jun/23/uk-and-germany-break-solar-power-records","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-23T14:26:29Z","webTitle":"UK and Germany break solar power records","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/23/uk-and-germany-break-solar-power-records","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jun/23/uk-and-germany-break-solar-power-records","fields":{"headline":"UK and Germany break solar power records","bodyText":"Britain and Germany have broken records for generating solar electricity in the last few weeks, according to new industry figures. Germany generated over half its electricity demand from solar for the first time ever on 9 June, and the UK, basking in the sunniest weather of summer during the longest days of the year, nearly doubled its 2013 peak solar power output at the solstice weekend. France, Italy, Denmark and other countries are also believed to have generated record amounts in June. According to UK trade body the Solar Trade association (STA), the total UK installed solar capacity generated from homes, buildings and solar farms is now about 4.7 gigawatts compared to 2.7GW in July last year. It is not possible to tell exactly how much solar power was generated in Britain because electricity from small-scale household units is not centrally measured, but the STA estimated on Monday that 3.9% of the UK's electricity demand was met by solar photovoltaic systems (PV) over the 24 hours of Saturday. This means solar's contribution peaked at a record 7.8% of daytime electricity, on 21 June, said the association. \"Britain has virtually doubled its capacity in the last year, with 80,000 more installations, including several thousand larger scale commercial ones,\" said Ray Noble, a consultant at the UK National Solar Centre. \"There are now 530,000 installations in the UK, of which 510,000 are domestic small scale ones. Last weekend we estimate they generated about 8% of daytime electricity in total,\" said Noble. \"We think that this is likely to double again within a year. There is nothing to stop it getting to 30-40% of UK electricity at this time of year,\" he said. The figures were welcomed by UK energy minister Greg Barker, who was criticised in May for removing subsidies for large-scale solar farms. \"We have put ourselves among the world leaders on solar and this ambitious strategy will place us right at the cutting edge. \"There is massive potential to turn our large buildings into power stations and we must seize the opportunity this offers to boost our economy as part of our long term economic plan. \"Solar not only benefits the environment, it will see British job creation and deliver the clean and reliable energy supplies that the country needs at the lowest possible cost to consumers.\" Germany, with 1.4m PV systems, generated a peak of 23.1GW hours at lunchtime on Monday 9 June, equivalent to 50.6% of its total electricity need. According to government development agency Germany trade and invest (GTAI), solar power grew 34% in the first five months of 2014 compared to last year. Europe added 10.9GW of PV capacity in 2013, said the European photovoltaic industry association (Epia), bringing the total installed capacity to over 81GW on the continent. \"This represents a 16% increase compared to the year before and about 59% of the world's cumulative photovoltaic capacity,\" said a spokesman. \"2013 was a record year for the UK, with 1.5GW installed last year. Germany installed 3.3GW, Italy 1.4GW, Romania 1.1GW and Greece 1.04GW.\" But new figures from the Washington-based Earth Policy Institute suggest Europe is no longer the biggest market for solar power. In 2013, says the EPI report, China added \"at least\" 11.3GW and is now the second largest generator of solar power after Germany, and the US added some 4.8GW, increasing its total capacity by 65% to 12GW. \"PV remains the most rapidly-growing energy technology by a wide margin. Indeed, global PV installations for 2014 should reach at least 40,000 megawatts, expanding world PV capacity by another 30 percent,\" says author J Matthew Roney. California now has more than 240,000 small-scale solar installations on commercial and residential roofs across the state that amount to more than 2,200 MW of generation capacity. The US figure was greatly augmented by 25 new large-scale solar projects including the largest solar plant in the world in the Mojave desert 40 miles southwest of Las Vegas. Elsewhere, Canada added 440 megawatts to reach 1.2GW in 2013, Mexico nearly doubled its PV capacity to 100MW and is expected to reach 240MW by the end of 2014 and Japan, spurred by the closure of nuclear power plants following Fukushima more than doubled its capacity by adding 6.9GW in 2013. According to the European photovoltaic industry report, solar power is expected to grow 20% a year over the next few years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/26/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-26T10:17:26Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: IPCC, wildlife comeback and energy giants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/26/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/26/1","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: IPCC, wildlife comeback and energy giants","bodyText":"Environment news • Climate change: UN makes high-risk attempt to break deadlock on talks • Leading climate change economist brands sceptics 'irrational' • Beaver and bison among European species making a comeback • Arctic on course for ice-free summer 'within decades', scientists say • Police accused of bias over culling of badgers • Russia to charge Greenpeace activists with piracy over oil rig protest • Axed Australian Climate Commission to be resurrected as Climate Council • House sparrow decline stabilises, figures show • Record number of rhinos killed in South Africa in 2013 On the blogs • Energy giants will blink first in Miliband's price freeze challenge • You v gravity: the cyclist's joy of climbing • George Monbiot on the badger cull: Do the police act at the behest of the UK's rich and powerful? • Why bananas are giving caimans bad blood Multimedia • Badger cull police threaten to pass protester details to farmers' union - video • ZSL animal photography prize 2013 - in pictures • The week in wildlife – in pictures • 2013 Fritz Pölking nature photography award - in pictures Features and comment • Bee news roundup: Why they're vanishing, a $10m bee defense fund, and a new 'solitary' bee • Tom Greatrex: Shale gas alone is not the answer – but neither is renewable energy • Clive Hamilton: Why geoengineering suits Russia's carbon agenda • Rihanna's Instagram pic with slow loris prompts police raid Best of the web • First US nuclear power closures in 15 years signal wider industry problems • Is US offshore wind power finally ready to take off? • IPCC report: sceptic groups launch global anti-science campaign • Romanians mobilise in protest against gold mine plans ...

ING Bank said: With markets gradually having doubts about a first rate hike in the US, market expectations about more ECB QE have increased recently. Indeed, the stronger euro might be one of the “unwarranted tightening” factors about which the ECB has always warned. In our view, however, the ECB will refrain from more QE, at least at the current juncture, and will rely on its often-used verbal intervention skills. Technical difficulties to step up QE and too many uncertainties about the future path of growth and inflation should motivate the ECB to postpone any decision on more QE. However, the past has shown several times that the ECB’s ability to talk the talk without eventually having to walk the walk is rather limited. On that note, we’re closing up the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back again tomorrow. US markets are falling in early trading following the disappointing results from Morgan Stanley. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost more than 60 points or nearly 0.4% while the S&amp;P 550 is down 0.35%. The Wall Street decline has taken the shine off European shares, with France’s Cac now in negative territory, down 0.12%, although Germany’s Dax is still 0.5% better, albeit off its best levels. The FTSE 100, which was already on the slide as commodity companies weighed on the market after the Chinese GDP data, is now down 30 points or 0.5%. Back with Greece, and the recapitalisation of the country’s four major banks should be completed by the end of the year, according to Danièle Nouy, chair of the supervisory board of the European Central Bank. In a speech to the European Parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, she said: In early summer, the uncertainty surrounding the Greek programme was for us, just as for you, at the centre of our attention. For Greek banks, these developments implied a renewed very intense and stressful episode. We therefore monitored the developments very closely and took supervisory actions where needed. We were relieved that an agreement was reached at the Euro Summit in July. In the follow-up to the Summit, we are now conducting a comprehensive assessment of the four Greek significant institutions, to help determine the recapitalisation needs. The recapitalisation should be concluded by the end of the year. Thus it is important that the necessary funds will be available on time. The full speech is here. The latest reports from China show conflicting signs about the state of the world’s second largest economy, writes Phillip Inman: China is on the road to recovery. Or maybe it isn’t, at least not for some time, say the contradictory reports on the world’s second-largest economy. The latest GDP figures, showing a growth rate in the third quarter of 6.9%, down from 7% in the second quarter, have done little to lay this particular debate to rest. Some analysts argue Beijing is stuck in a rut, unable to wean itself off the colossal volumes of investment needed to keep its industrial turbines turning. Others spy a rising middle class with a strong appetite for services. They argue China will soon be rebalancing away from smoke stack industries and employ millions more people in an expanded health service, transport system and financial services. What they all agree on is that official figures from Beijing’s economic ministries should be treated with scepticism.

That’s a nice return already on her investment. More news from the US, and Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley has just reported a 42.4% fall in third quarter earnings to $939m. It was hit by turbulence in bond, currency and commodity markets following the concerns about the Chinese economy. Over in the US, Oprah Winfrey has linked up with Weight Watchers International, buying a 10% stake in the business - with an option for another 5% - and is joining the board. Winfrey said: “I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.” As Chinese president Xi Jinping begins his state visit to the UK, British people expect China to overtake Europe as our most valuable trading partner in 20 years. A poll by YouGov also shows Brits are enthusiastic about closer economic co-operation with the Chinese. Of those surveyed, 40% said our most valuable trading partner was Europe, with 23% choosing China. But in the next two decades this is expected to change, with 29% predicting China will be our top partner and 22% forecasting it will still be Europe. Nearly half - 43% - said the UK should be seeking closer trading links with China, with 31% saying it should continue the current level of economic co-operation and only 8% saying it should weaken ties. The majority - 54% - believed China would to continue into the next two decades with either much stronger economic growth than now (22%) or slightly stronger growth than now (32%). Only 14% predicted weaker growth. In addition, 37% expected China’s growth to lift the UK’s, while 26% said it wouldcome at the expense of western economies and 10% said it would not make any difference. But YouGov added: The British public seems to have a pragmatic approach to economic relations with China, but there is not much evidence of great affection for the country. Of the 12 biggest economies by GDP excluding the USA and those in Europe, China comes in at 8th in terms of net positive impressions (29% positive, 55% negative). Ireland has moved to cut back on one and two cent coins, with plans to launch a nationwide scheme to allow retailers to round bills to the nearest five cents - with the consent of shoppers. PA reports: Since the euro was introduced in 2001 Ireland has spent €37m issuing one and two cent coins - minting the coppers at three times the rate of the rest of the eurozone. But the initiative to reduce the need for coppers is voluntary and consumers will retain the right to pay the exact bill and request their exact change. The Central Bank insisted rounding would only apply to cash transactions and not to credit card, electronic or cheque payments and it would also only be used on the final cash total of a bill and not to individual goods. As examples it said final bills ending in one and two cents or six and seven cents would be rounded down to the nearest five and those ending in three and four cents or eight and nine cents would be rounded up. Other rules on the rounding scheme include that one and two cent coins remain legal tender. The nationwide initiative starts on October 28. It follows a successful trial in Wexford in 2013, which showed that 85% of consumers and 100% of retailers in Wexford who expressed an opinion wanted rounding rolled out nationally. Back to China, and the weak GDP figures show that the stimulus measures introduced by the country’s central bank have had a limited effect, said Professor Kamel Mellahi at Warwick Business School. He said: If there is one thing to take away from the third quarter figures it is the limited short-term impact of financial and economic stimulus packages on the Chinese economy. The Chinese Government has introduced a number of measures to stimulate economic growth, but so far the needle hasn’t moved much. Right now it’s very important the Chinese Government is focused on the long-term economic fundamentals and resists the temptation to take unnecessary actions simply to meet short-term economic growth targets. One cannot, and should not, read too much into the third quarter growth figures. A growth of 6.9% is slightly below official government expectations but they are also marginally better than the 6.8% that most economists have predicted. Because it’s the weakest growth since 2009, the figures are very symbolic but I don’t think they tell us something substantially new about the state of the Chinese economy. The 0.2% fall in eurozone construction in August compared to July was due to civil enginering declining by 0.3% and building construction by 0.2%, according to statistics office Eurostat. In the wider European Union, construction output fell by 1.2% month on month. The year on year decline in the euro area was 6% and in the EU as a whole 5%. The full report is here: Production in construction down by 0.2% in euro area Eurozone construction output came in weaker in August, new figures have just revealed: More on the Chinese figures and their accuracy or otherwise. Real growth could be closer to 3% to 4% according to Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell. He said: Chinese headline GDP growth looks healthy at 6.9% but underlying metrics suggest the real growth rate could be nearer 3% – 4%. If you look at growth in rail cargo traffic, electricity consumption and demand for loans, three metrics favoured by Prime Minister Li, the picture is not so healthy. Credit growth still looks promising but freight shipments and electricity demand growth look to be sagging, so the so-called Li Keqiang index does raise a few questions. Today’s GDP figures are encouraging but investors with exposure to China should still expect some bumps and lumps along the way. One of the disadvantages of being a stock market index laden with commodity companies is that the sector often has a disproportionate influence on events. So it is today. With the weak Chinese data mining companies have come under pressure on concerns about slowing demand from the world’s second largest economy. With the likes of Anglo American and Glencore down between 2% and 4%, this means the FTSE 100 has slipped back into negative territory, while other European markets are still moving higher. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Overall growth in China in the third quarter was a respectable 6.9%, while strength in consumer spending will allay some fears about a slowdown. However, the figures will do nothing to dispel the idea that this particular growth bonanza has come to an end. Big name mining stocks are in the red again this morning, with the sector at its lowest level in nearly two weeks. It looks increasingly like the bounce of early October was a false dawn, and barring some kind of sustained revival in risk appetite, perhaps via fresh monetary stimulus, the sector is heading lower once again. One of the main economic events this week is the latest meeting of the European Cental Bank, due to take place in Malta. Despite the weakness of the global economy and continued low inflation, the bank is widely expected to keep its quantitive easing programme unchanged but suggest it is ready to act further if necessary. Many economists believe an expansion of the programme - which involves €60bn of asset purchases a month and is due to run until at least September 2016 - could be unveiled in December. ECB board member Ewald Nowotny said it was too early to discuss changing the programme in one of a couple of interviews over the weekend and today. He said (quote from Reuters): In my view it’s too early to talk about (adjusting the asset purchases) because we still have almost a year of the programme ahead of us. Economists at RBC Capital Markets said: [Nowotny] remarked that Fed policy was not a “decisive aspect” in ECB decision-making, and that one should also not overestimate the impact of a slowdown in China. His more hawkish tone contrasts with the dovish tenor to his remarks from last week, where he acknowledged the clear weakness in domestic inflationary trends. Nowotny said in a separate interview that the ECB has to show it is in control of inflation but governments may need to loosen fiscal policies to boost growth. He said it was too early to determine long term inflation trends, with low oil and commodity prices at the moment having a strong influence. The service sector is now the biggest part of the Chinese economy: One of the shares pushing the German market higher is Deutsche Bank. It has jumped more than 3% after unveiling plans over the weekend to split its investment bank in two, and removing a number of top executives as part of an overhaul by chief executive John Cryan. Earlier this month the bank announced a record loss of €6bn in the third quarter. The full story is here: European markets are now making a better fist of it after an uncertain start, as traders take a more positive view of the Chinese data (it was disappointing but not as bad as expected). The FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany’s Dax has added 0.9% and France’s Cac is up 0.8%. Over in Greece, and the country’s creditors will be reviewing its finances and the progress of reforms to release the next tranche of the €2bn rescue package. The move follows the successful passing of measures through parliament early on Saturday, despite protests against the package. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Representatives of Greece’s lenders – the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund – are expected to return to Athens on Tuesday to start a review that, Greece hopes, will end successfully, paving the way for the launch of talks on debt relief. The auditors are to scour Greece’s finances too, following the presentation of the draft budget. Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos is expected to request flexibility, arguing that the recession estimates in the draft budget – 2.3% of gross domestic product this year and 1.3% next year – are overly pessimistic. His aim is to eliminate some of the more contentious austerity measures that Greece has suspended, such as plans for a 23% value added tax on private schools and higher taxes on rental income. As regards pension reform, another controversial issue, the government is keen to convince creditors to allow the inclusion of certain prior actions in a broader overhaul of the pension system, to come later. As regards the €2bn loan tranche, the Euro Working Group is to convene on Wednesday and may recommend the immediate release of the money or may ask Greece to legislate more actions from the first list of prior actions. The full report is here. Despite the weak Chinese numbers, Tim Condon at ING Bank believes the Chinese central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates any further. He said: The third quarter GDP data on its own implies a revision in our full-year forecast to 6.9% from 6.8%. However, our previous forecast was based on an acceleration in fourth quarter growth from reduced financial market turbulence and the impact of the stimulus implemented in response to the turbulence. We think the argument still applies and we are revising our full-year forecast to 7.0% (Bloomberg consensus 6.8%). We see the September economic data, including the money and credit data released last week, as enabling the PBOC to remain on hold. We are revising our forecast of one 25 basis point policy interest cut in the current quarter to no more cuts. We retain our forecast of one more cut in the reserve ratio requirement [the amount of cash that lenders must hold as reserves] in the current quarter to sterilize the impact of hot money outflows on interbank liquidity. One of the biggest UK fallers so far is pharmaceutical group Shire. Its shares are down 1.8% after the US Food and Drug Administration said late on Friday that it would not approve the company’s new dry eye drug, lifitegrast, based on current data. Chief executive Flemming Ornskov said he was disappointed but still hoped to launch the treatment in 2016. If results from a new phase 3 trial due by the end of the year are positive, Shire planned to refile a submission to the FDA in the first quarter of 2016. Ornskov said: We are committed to working with FDA to expeditiously provide the evidence required to deliver a new prescription treatment option for the 29 million adults in the US living with the symptoms of this chronic and progressive disease. This is an area of unmet medical need for which there has been no new FDA-approved treatment in over a decade. The weak Chinese GDP data has seen European shares get off to an uncertain start for the week. The FTSE 100 is up 0.15% but Germany’s Dax, France’s Cac and Spain’s Ibex have dipped 0.2%. In China itself, the Shanghai composite has ended down 0.1% at 3386.7 points. Oil prices have edged lower on renewed concerns about a lack of demand amid a supply glut, with Brent crude down 0.48% at $50.22 a barrel. On the corporate front, ITV has agreed to pay £100m for the television business of Northern Irish broadcaster UTV in a long expected deal. It means the long-gestating consolitation of the independent television network is getting into its final stages, with 13 of the 15 licences now in the hands of ITV. Analysts at Liberum: We see the deal as a strategic plus, especially if ITV can charge retransmission revenues for the main channel where we expect more newsflow before Christmas. We reiterate ITV as our top pick in media sector. More suggestions the official Chinese GDP figure may be an overestimation: The Chinese data comes as the country’s president, Xi Jinping, begins his first official state visit to London. There are likely to be deals signed and co-operation agreements made, but the visit is controversial. It is likely to be marked by protests against human rights abuses, and concerns that the UK may be jeopardising national security by allowing Chinese state companies to invest in British nuclear power plants. And it comes amid increased wariness towards China by the US. More here: In Asia the Shanghai Composite is currently down 0.48%, while the Nikkei is 0.88% lower and the Hang Seng is down 0.54%. European markets are expected to make an uncertain start after the mixed messages from the Chinese data. Here are the opening forecasts from IG Index: Good morning and welcome to our our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. China is in the spotlight once more, with news of a slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter. The world’s second largest economy grew by 6.9%, compared to 7% in the previous quarter, and the lowest rate since the 6.2% recorded in 2009 during the global recession. The figure was slightly better than the 6.7% expected by economists but is still likely to prompt concerns about the outlook. The government has cut interest rates five times since November, and further stimulus measures are expected in the wake of a continued slowdown. Our full report is here: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Last week’s China trade balance numbers showed that while exports improved slightly, the sharp drop in imports suggested that internal demand remains constrained by the weakness in commodity prices, as well as lower domestic consumption, raising concerns that the Chinese government could well find it difficult to hit its 7% GDP target for this year. This morning’s Chinese Q3 GDP was expected to reinforce these concerns, but came in rather conveniently slightly better than markets had been expecting at 6.9%, and above some of the more pessimistic expectations of 6.7%. While most people accept that China’s GDP numbers should only be taking at face value, due to concerns that it is artificially inflated, this number does seem surprisingly good given how weak some of the more recent individual data components have been. This is borne out by a much bigger than expected drop in the September industrial production numbers, which came in at 5.7% and well below expectations of 6%, and well down from 6.1% in August, while Chinese retail sales saw an increase of 10.9%, only slightly higher than August’s 10.8%. Fixed asset investment also disappointed, coming in at 10.3%, down from 10.9% in August. Economist Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting echoed the scepticism about the Chinese figures. He told the Today programme: “The figures are produced remarkably quickly and rarely revised.” And he believes the real figure is closer to 3%. Otherwise it appears a relatively quiet day so far, but we’ll be keeping an eye on all the latest developments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/17/nuclear-south-korea-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-17T18:07:09Z","webTitle":"British nuclear energy industry could attract South Korean investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/17/nuclear-south-korea-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/17/nuclear-south-korea-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"British nuclear energy industry could attract South Korean investment","bodyText":"South Korea could become the next nation to take a stake in the British nuclear industry as the financing deal with France and China for a new reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset creates a wave of wider interest. The move could trigger controversy because the Korean atomic industry has been hit by a scandal over fake safety certificates but the UK and South Korea have vowed to help restore credibility and build closer links in this sector. Lloyd's Register, which provides risk management services, has been hired by Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power Company to help give the country's reactors a clean bill of health. But senior executives for the London-based Lloyd's say the relationship is a two-way process with the Koreans also looking at the best route to enter the British market in the aftermath of the Chinese investment in Hinkley Point. \"Discussions are ongoing and I would not be surprised to see, in a year or so's time, the Koreans taking an equity investment in the UK market,\" said Richard Clegg, a managing director at Lloyd's Register and a former chief scientist at the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment. David Cameron met the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, in London two weeks ago with the media headlines taken up with joint agreements on how to tackle the threat of nuclear weapons in North Korea. But the two leaders also promised to increase commercial ties in everything from nuclear power to financial services. The Lloyd's deal, which was signed on the sidelines, will help over a two-year period with the safety certificate problem that has forced some of the 23 South Korean reactors offline. Clegg said the Hinkley Point financing agreement between Britain, EDF of France, China General Nuclear Corporation and China National Nuclear Corporation had attracted a lot of attention among other potential atomic investors. Ministers have agreed to guarantee a generous price of up to £92.50 per megawatt-hour of electricity for 35 years, more than twice the current market rate. Clegg believes that Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan, which have their own different consortiums for building potential new plants in Britain, can be expected to press ahead with firm investment plans too. \"We have been here before, of course. Sizewell [the last new nuclear plant constructed in Britain] was meant to be the first every year for a decade but with all the macro-pressures there are now around energy security my personal judgment is that we will see more than one and we could see six,\" he said. The next site after Hinkley in Somerset is likely to be Sizewell, where EDF and the Chinese have rights to build, and Clegg believes that the Far East partners will want to be playing an even bigger role than just taking an equity stake. \"I think we can expect to see the Chinese pushing for their one equipment and supply chain to be used with a longer term aim of being able to sell nuclear technology into emerging markets such as the Middle East, Africa and south-east Asia.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/aug/31/vladimir-putin-kiev-statehood-talks-ukraine-russia-mariupol","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-31T18:27:48Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin calls on Kiev to enter 'statehood' talks for south-east Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/31/vladimir-putin-kiev-statehood-talks-ukraine-russia-mariupol","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/aug/31/vladimir-putin-kiev-statehood-talks-ukraine-russia-mariupol","fields":{"headline":"Vladimir Putin calls on Kiev to enter 'statehood' talks for south-east Ukraine","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has called on Kiev to enter discussions on \"statehood\" for the south-east regions of Ukraine a day after the EU gave Russia a week to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine or face further sanctions. In excerpts of an interview with state television broadcast on Sunday evening, the Russian president said talks between Ukrainian authorities and separatist leaders in the east should begin immediately and be about \"not just technical issues but on the political organisation of society and statehood in south-eastern Ukraine\". His spokesperson later said Putin had not meant the region should gain independence, but that dialogue should begin. Western leaders have accused Russia of fanning the flames of the insurgency in east Ukraine, and in recent weeks of providing direct military assistance, as the armed rebels suffered a number of losses to the Ukrainian army and appeared on the brink of defeat. The EU said late on Saturday that if Russia did not reverse course in Ukraine within a week, a further round of sanctions would be imposed, but there is disagreement inside the 28-member block about the effectiveness of sanctions and a fear that more serious measures would also harm European economies. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the new sanctions would build on existing measures against Russia. Senior diplomats confirmed the punitive measures were not so much new as a tightening of the restrictions imposed in July on Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. \"It's about closing loopholes,\" said a diplomat. They warned, however, that it could be weeks before any new sanctions were applied, perhaps as late as October. The Senate foreign relations committee chairman and Obama administration loyalist, Robert Menendez, called for the US to arm the Ukrainian military. Speaking in Kiev, he said: \"This is a watershed moment. Thousands of Russian troops are here and are directly engaged in what is clearly an invasion. We should be providing the Ukrainians with the types of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon Putin for further aggression.\" Kiev has said it will not negotiate with the leaders of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, which it lists as terrorists. But in an apparent victory for Moscow, the separatists said they would be partaking in talks in Minsk this week with a delegation from Kiev. Analysts have speculated that Putin does not want a Crimea-style annexation, which would be expensive and militarily difficult, but instead wants to create a \"frozen conflict\" that would give Moscow permanent leverage in Ukraine. Since talks between Putin and the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, in Minsk last Tuesday, the situation on the ground has changed, with rebel forces taking control of Novoazovsk in the far south-east of the country, which they are believed to have taken with help from regular Russian army soldiers and equipment. But the promised assault on the key port city of Mariupol has not materialised. Many residents have been digging trenches on the outskirts of the city and preparing to defend it in recent days. Mariupol was under rebel control at the beginning of the uprising but was taken back by Kiev's forces in June and most of its residents have little appetite for further violence, although many remain sceptical about the new Ukrainian government. Kiev has said it will defend Mariupol from any rebel assault, though there is little sign of serious reinforcements with which to repel any attack. The majority of the forces involved in last line of defence appear to be from volunteer battalions. Vadim, a commander in the Azov battalion, known for its far-right leanings, said on Sunday that it was imperative to defend the city because it was a strategic importance. \"If we lose Mariupol we will lose the war,\" said the 34-year-old, as he headed to a factory to transport concrete blocks to reinforce checkpoints on the outskirts of the city. Ukrainian forces said two coastguard vessels had come under fire off the coast of Mariupol. Videos from the scene showed a plume of smoke rising from an object several miles offshore. It was unclear how the boats were attacked or whether there were victims among the crew. A military spokesman said a rescue operation was under way on Sunday evening. People in the vicinity said they heard loud explosions but did not see or hear any aircraft, suggesting they may have been hit by missiles fired from land. Russia has denied all accusations that its soldiers are active in eastern Ukraine, stating that a group of paratroopers captured inside the country had got lost and crossed \"by accident\" and all other Russians fighting in the region were volunteers or serving soldiers \"on holiday\". The paratroopers were handed back to Russia over the weekend after what a Russian general, Alexei Ragozin, described as \"very difficult\" negotiations. He said it was unacceptable that the Ukrainians had detained the men, and noted that Russia had returned Ukrainian soldiers who had strayed over the Russian border previously. The Ukrainian soldiers generally crossed the border to escape fighting, whereas Kiev accuses the Russians of coming to Ukraine to wage war. The latest such group, comprising 63 fighters, was sent back to Ukraine in exchange for the captured paratroopers. In interviews, the Russian paratroopers claimed they had not realised they were inside Ukraine until they came under fire. The claims that they crossed the border accidentally have been mocked by Kiev, and during the capture of Novoazovsk earlier in the week there were numerous sightings by locals of \"green men\" – well equipped soldiers wearing no insignia but immediately distinguishable from the irregular rebels. Nato said it believed at least 1,000 regular Russian soldiers were operating inside Ukraine. Putin, however, has insisted that the conflict is an \"internal Ukrainian\" matter. His rhetoric in recent days has been bullish, comparing the Ukrainian army offensive in the east to the Nazi siege of Leningrad and reminding the west that Russia is a nuclear power and \"it's better not to mess with us\".

Towering over America's pacific coast, Godzilla looks the real deal. His body-type is pear; small head, big bottom, ginormous paws. His back is covered in spines that in profile resemble a stage of the Tour de France. His tail smashes readily through internationally recognisable tourist locations. His roar is louder than Barbra Streisand. Most importantly, you can identify with the dude; his baleful eyes, his thankless role as nature's last line of defence. Sadly for this film, the two-miles-tall lizard is the only sympathetic character in it. The latest update on the Japanese cinematic behemoth that last came to America in 1998 as a light stomp romp starring Matthew Broderick, this earnest reboot has been sweatily anticipated in some quarters. It's directed by Gareth Edwards, the 38-year-old Brit whose previous film, Monsters, identified him as an aficionado of the genre and a special-effects whiz to boot. That film was handmade on a budget of $500,000; this one cost an estimated $160m and was ordered by Warner Brothers. The result is a clash between massive, lovingly recreated reptiles and the appetites of a corporate vampire squid. The squid wins. So while many people might want to go to the cinema to see Godzilla, what they get instead is a load of homosapiens desperately trying to put a human face on the drama. They don't really succeed. A line of actual acting talent – from Bryan Cranston to Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche and Ken Watanabe – is reduced to a series of B-movie tropes, from crazed eccentric to rumpled scientist. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the hero Ford Brody, yet another all-American beefcake whose only discernible character trait is his ability to talk gently to children. The kids themselves, no doubt intended as a point of identification for a young audience, are really just a procession of glass-eyed, floppy-haired bores. The story has been told so many times that you can call it with your eyes closed. America is living happily, America is in peril, America confidently thinks it can solve its problem with guns, America can't, America panics, America is saved by a single bloke. America has now been under existential threat so many times, and from so many adversaries, that you wonder why anyone even bothers trying to assemble a military response any more. Just ask that plucky individual to do it by himself, it tends to work. As well as draining the film of any true suspense, the dramatic premise of Godzilla is delivered entirely po-faced. There's some kind of subtext about the abuse of nuclear power, perhaps an environmentalist thread too. It's all a bit muddled. But whatever the message is, it's delivered at the expense of humour. Even Cranston, who in his role as eccentric whistleblower is channeling the spirit of Malcolm in the Middle, gets just one joke to deliver. \"I don't get many visitors,\" he says when Taylor-Johnson pays a visit to his conspiracy pit. Even that comes over as sad. Predictable and two-dimensional, Godzilla is still not without moments of beauty. Alexandre Desplat's score is restrained and evocative with hints of kaiji movies past. Not only is the titular beast sympathetic, he has a sense of style, emerging elegantly through clouds of smoke to take out another adversary. There's a tsunami that crashes through the middle of the film like a cascade, its glassy waters filled to bursting with the effects of civilisation, suddenly just so much detritus. And the \"quarantine zone\", an abandoned city in Japan that may or may not recall Fukushima, is an imaginative visual rendering of what humanity might leave behind should we finally blow our time on earth. Compressed together, those moments take up about five minutes of viewing time. The rest you can miss."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/video/2014/jul/18/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-grand-central-supermensch-pudsey-dog-movie-video-review","type":"video","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-18T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"The Guardian Film Show: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Pudsey the Dog: The Movie, Supermensch, Grand Central - video reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/18/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-grand-central-supermensch-pudsey-dog-movie-video-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/video/2014/jul/18/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-grand-central-supermensch-pudsey-dog-movie-video-review","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian Film Show: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Pudsey the Dog: The Movie, Supermensch, Grand Central - video reviews","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2014/mar/30/james-lovelock-environmentalism-religion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-30T17:30:29Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock: environmentalism has become a religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/30/james-lovelock-environmentalism-religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/30/james-lovelock-environmentalism-religion","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock: environmentalism has become a religion","bodyText":"Environmentalism has \"become a religion\" and does not pay enough attention to facts, according to James Lovelock. The 94 year-old scientist, famous for his Gaia hypothesis that Earth is a self-regulating, single organism, also said that he had been too certain about the rate of global warming in his past book, that \"it’s just as silly to be a [climate] denier as it is to be a believer” and that fracking and nuclear power should power the UK, not renewable sources such as windfarms. Speaking to the Guardian for an interview ahead of a landmark UN climate science report on Monday on the impacts of climate change, Lovelock said of the warnings of climate catastrophe in his 2006 book, Revenge of Gaia: \"I was a little too certain in that book. You just can’t tell what’s going to happen.\" “It [the impact from climate change] could be terrible within a few years, though that’s very unlikely, or it could be hundreds of years before the climate becomes unbearable,\" he said. Lovelock's comments appear to be at odds with dire forecasts from a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday, which leaked versions show will warn that even small temperature rises will bring \"abrupt and irreversible changes\" to natural systems, including Arctic sea ice and coral reefs. Asked if his remarks would give ammunition to climate change sceptics, he said: \"It’s just as silly to be a denier as it is to be a believer. You can’t be certain.\" Talking about the environmental movement, Lovelock says: \"It’s become a religion, and religions don’t worry too much about facts.\" The retired scientist, who worked at the Medical Research Council, describes himself as an \"old-fashioned green.\" Lovelock reiterated his support for fracking for shale gas, which has been strongly backed by David Cameron and the government but vigorously opposed by anti-fracking activists and local people at sites from Salford to Balcombe in West Sussex. “The government is too frightened to use nuclear, renewables won’t work –because we don’t have enough sun – and we can’t go on burning coal because it produces so much CO2, so that leaves fracking. It produces only a fraction of the amount of CO2 that coal does, and will make Britain secure in energy for quite a few years. We don’t have much choice,\" he said. Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: \"I think every year it becomes harder to generalise about environmentalism. These days it ranges from people like green activists of the 1970s who Lovelock perhaps has in mind through to chief executives who say this is one of the most pressing concerns we have to address.\" \"The environmental community is no longer a minority but a majority of people who are concerned about the planet. That makes it much harder than ever to pigeonhole who the environmental community is.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/feb/04/centrica-withdraw-new-nuclear-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-04T11:44:29Z","webTitle":"Centrica withdraws from new UK nuclear projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/04/centrica-withdraw-new-nuclear-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/04/centrica-withdraw-new-nuclear-projects","fields":{"headline":"Centrica withdraws from new UK nuclear projects","bodyText":"Energy company Centrica has abandoned its plans for building new nuclear reactors in the UK, blaming rising costs and construction delays. The move is a blow to the government's aspirations to build the most ambitious fleet of new reactors in Europe, and comes on the day MPs severely criticised the management of nuclear waste at Sellafield and after Cumbria county council rejected proposals for a deep burial site to permanently dispose of the waste. Centrica will forfeit its 20% option on four new nuclear plants planned by EDF in Somerset and Suffolk, writing down £200m in the process. EDF, owned by the French state, has been in talks with the state-owned China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation, which may pick up Centrica's option. Centrica's exit means no major UK company remains involved in plans for new nuclear reactors in the UK, but Centrica retains its 20% stake in eight existing nuclear power stations. Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, said: \"We believe that nuclear generation has a valuable role to play in a balanced UK energy mix. However, since our initial investment [in 2008], the anticipated project costs in new nuclear have increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of years.\" In particular, Laidlaw blamed the very large 1.6GW units planned for Hinkley Point in Somerset for making the project more expensive, and design modifications imposed after the Fukushima disaster for adding to delays. EDF is building a reactor at Flamanville in north-west France, but it is years late and its cost has ballooned from about €3bn to over €8bn. The company had pledged to make its final investment decision on the Hinkley reactors by the end of 2012, but failed to do so. It is currently negotiating with the government over the price that will be guaranteed for electricity from the plant. EDF said it understood that the profile and scale of the investment in new nuclear plants did not meet Centrica's shareholders' expectations but said momentum behind the \"shovel-ready\" Hinkley Point project remained strong. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said: \"EDF Energy is working with the government to agree a price for the electricity at Hinkley which will be fair and balanced for UK consumers and investors. This [agreement] is now, more than ever, the key to attracting investors and giving the UK the secure, low-carbon energy it needs for the future.\" Centrica's pull-out follows that of other major energy companies operating in the UK, with E.ON and RWE exiting its Horizon joint venture in 2012 and SSE in 2011. New nuclear reactors are vital to the government's plans to replace the UK's ageing reactors and dirty coal-fired power stations with low-carbon energy. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) denied Centrica's withdrawal reflected badly on the government: \"The decision reflects the company's investment priorities and is not a reflection on UK government policy. The recent purchase of Horizon Nuclear Power by Hitachi is clear evidence of the attractiveness of the new nuclear market in the UK. We are determined to make the UK a leading global destination for investment in new nuclear, which will play a key role in our future energy mix.\" Tom Burke, at thinktank E3G and a former special adviser to three Conservative environment secretaries, said: \"The really important question now is what does Centrica know that DECC does not? MPs will decide on Thursday whether the imminent decision on the agreed price for Hinkley Point's electricity should be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, which today condemned Sellafield's handling of nuclear waste as a bad deal for taxpayers. That referral would provide a welcome opportunity test whether Hinkley is a good deal for taxpayers.\" Greenpeace's Doug Parr said: \"The Centrica pull-out has exposed a very troubled UK energy strategy. This government's relentless focus on new nuclear has lost us years of investment in truly green energy and we now need a plan B to deliver a clean, safe energy system – one that doesn't depend on deluded estimates of how much nuclear will get built. The longer the government chases its nuclear dream, the more the UK loses out on the jobs and economic benefits that viable, affordable green energy will bring.\" Laidlaw said Centrica would now invest in developing new gas production in the UK, Norway and North America and pursue renewable energy projects including a big windfarm off the Suffolk coast called Race Bank. The company's nuclear investment in 2008 was funded by a £2.2bn rights issue, but with Monday's pull-out, it will give £500m back to shareholders via a share repurchase programme. Laidlaw defended this move, at a time of soaring consumer energy bills, saying the company has invested £11bn in the UK in the past five years, during which shareholders had received £1bn in dividends. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said: \"The decision to give cash back to shareholders rather than invest in new nuclear will be an embarrassment for the coalition government.\" But George Borovas, head of international nuclear projects at law firm Pillsbury, said: \"Centrica's exit underscores the challenges that new build projects will continue to face in the UK as well as globally. However, new investors will quickly move to take Centrica's position and the government's hard work to attract foreign investment will probably pay off in this case.\" New nuclear power plans around the world China: After an 18-month delay following the Fukushima disaster, China is pressing ahead again with the world's most ambitious programme of new nuclear reactors. It began construction on four new plants between October and December 2012 and altogether hosts almost half of the world's 60 or so reactors under construction. Most of the major companies selling reactor designs, such as France's Areva and the USA's Westinghouse, are building their most advanced designs in China. Russia: There are 10 new reactors being built in Russia, which – like China – is a possible source of investment in the UK's new-build plans. India: There are seven new reactors under construction in India, with Russian and French companies most active. Japan is unable to participate because it does not export nuclear equipment to countries that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. South Korea: Three new reactors are under construction in South Korea, which has won a reputation for excellent operational performance. It also won the contract in 2009 to build four new reactors in the United Arab Emirates, ahead of French rival Areva. Work in the UAE began in 2012. USA: The explosion of cheap shale gas has deeply damaged the economic case for new nuclear plants in the US. Between 2007 and 2009, 28 applications for new reactors were filed, the first in 30 years. All but four have been cancelled or delayed although two construction licences were granted in 2012. American law forbids foreign-controlled ownership of nuclear facilities, barring major investment from abroad. European Union: France, Finland and Slovakia are the only European Union countries building new nuclear plants, but all the plants are delayed and over budget. The Slovakian reactors are being built with the backing of Italian energy giant Enel.

But times change. Before about 1970, academics had access to modest funding they could use freely. Industry was similarly enlightened. Their results included the transistor, the maser-laser, the electronics and telecommunications revolutions, nuclear power, biotechnology and medical diagnostics galore that enriched the lives of virtually everyone; they also boosted 20th-century economic growth. After 1970, politicians substantially expanded academic sectors. Peer review's uses allowed the rise of priorities, impact etc, and is now virtually unavoidable. Applicants' proposals must convince their peers that they serve national policies and are the best possible uses of resources. Success rates are about 25%, and strict rules govern resubmissions. Rejected proposals are usually lost. Industry too has lost its taste for the unpredictable. The 500 major discoveries, almost all initiated before about 1970, challenged mainstream science and would probably be vetoed today. Nowadays, fields where understanding is poor are usually neglected because researchers must convince experts that working in them will be beneficial. However, small changes would keep science healthy. Some are outlined in Donald Braben's book, Promoting the Planck Club: How Defiant Youth, Irreverent Researchers and Liberated Universities Can Foster Prosperity Indefinitely. But policies are deeply ingrained. Agencies claiming to support blue-skies research use peer review, of course, discouraging open-ended inquiries and serious challenges to prevailing orthodoxies. Mavericks once played an essential role in research. Indeed, their work defined the 20th century. We must relearn how to support them, and provide new options for an unforeseeable future, both social and economic. We need influential allies. Perhaps Guardian readers could help?

Campaigners opposed to the project dismissed the funding as a \"social bribe\" that only amounted to £3.3m annually over 40 years while wind farm developers complained they had to pay five times more in community benefits. People living around eight potential nuclear sites in England and Wales could be eligible for a package of benefits worth up to £1,000 per megawatt of power once a facility starts, the government said. \"New nuclear will have a central role to play in our energy strategy, providing heat and light to homes across the country. It is absolutely essential that we recognise the contributions of those communities that host major new energy projects,\" said Michael Fallon, the business and energy minister. \"This package is in the interests of local people, who will manage it to ensure long-term meaningful benefit to the community. It's proportionate to the scale and lifespan of new nuclear power stations and it builds on the major economic benefits they will bring in terms of jobs, investment and use of local services,\" he added. The government has already introduced similar incentive schemes around onshore wind farms after it became clear that opposition to new projects was reduced in other countries where local communities stood to benefit. Theo Simon, a spokesman for the Stop Hinkley campaign, said the offer to Somerset county council came at a time when there were £20m cuts taking place in its budget this year alone. \"It's not a lot of money – it's talked about as if it's a sort of compensation or reward, but it's really an acknowledgement that people in Somerset still feel profoundly unhappy about the whole plan for Hinkley C. Rather than seeing it as compensation we should see it as a social bribe.\" Simon said the kind of £90-plus \"strike price\" being talked about was already double the original figure proposed and would leave Somerset and the rest of the country saddled with much higher electricity bills. \"I can understand it's difficult for cash-strapped councillors to resist but it would be worth nothing to local farming and other communities in the event of an accident. The long-term impact of that would be massive.\" And Vince Dale, founder of renewable power company Ecotricity said onshore wind developers were being made to pay £5,000 per megawatt to local people. \"This is a further move by the government to rig the energy market against renewables in favour of nuclear and gas. Nuclear power is already being fast-tracked through the planning system and today they've announced nuclear will pay a fraction of the community benefit paid by wind power.\" The government is still in negotiations with EDF Energy over a \"strike price\" that would provide a guaranteed long-term income for new reactors at Hinkley Point. The government has already committed itself to a £10bn loan to the French-owned company but has repeatedly ruled out any subsidy for the Somerset project that is seen as a test case for any future atomic plants being built here. Meanwhile the decision to only give financial support to plants that change from coal, say, to biomass was condemned by the Renewable Energy Association as \"misguided\" and could halt an estimated £1.8bn worth of schemes which were in the pipeline. And both green power lobby and environmentalists expressed grave concern that the latest long-term projections contained in the EMR indicated ministers were cooling on prospects for offshore wind while expecting gas to play a potentially larger role with severe implications for Britain's carbon emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/09/love-living-next-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-09T23:00:42Z","webTitle":"Why we love living next to a nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/09/love-living-next-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/09/love-living-next-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Why we love living next to a nuclear power plant","bodyText":"The Kent village of Dungeness sits in the midst of a landscape unlike any other in Britain, or possibly even the world: as close to desert as to make no difference, dotted with an uneasy mixture of clapboard dwellings and fishing boats, some still in use and others long abandoned. The abiding sense is of humankind's place in the world dwindling to nothing, like the fade-out on a record; beyond the immediate horizon, there is nothing but nature at its most sparse. But as if to mark civilisation's last word in spectacular style, there is one final, jaw-dropping, man-made sight: two nuclear power stations, Dungeness A and B, respectively opened in 1965 and 1983. Dungeness A ceased generating electricity in 2006, but will remain here for the foreseeable future, while crews of workers see to the process we know as decommissioning; Dungeness B will shut down in 2018, but also remain intact for decades to come. One local I meet says she calls the power stations \"the candle factory\"; much like a lot of large-scale industrial installations, they are possessed of a strange but undeniable beauty. Look at them closely and you can make out a rather anomalous sight: a solitary row of white terrace houses, just beyond the power stations' perimeter fence. Called RNSSS Cottages, they took their name from the Royal Naval Shore Signal Service and were built as dwellings for forces personnel. Now they are owned by French electricity firm EDF Energy and leased via a property company. There are 11 in all. Thanks to Dungeness's huge nature reserve, the most spacious is used as a residential bird observatory (\"Great white egret – up to three seen occasionally,\" reads a notice in the window), but most of the other 10 are home to an assortment of families. Each house has three bedrooms; the rent is a very reasonable £400 a month. Ask the people here what brought them to live, as the cliché would have it, \"in the shadow\" of a nuclear plant, and most of the replies touch on the same themes: not just the low cost, but a very familiar view of most modern lives being beset with danger, annoyance and worry – noisy neighbours, traffic, petty violence, anxiety about what might happen to children. Here, by contrast, everyone I talk to enthuses about a strong feeling of security and a rare kind of community spirit. Put simply, they live in houses that happen to be next door to a nuclear power station because it makes them feel safe. Janice Patterson and Dave Johnson have lived in their house for four and a half years. She works as a care assistant with autistic adults; he's an activities co-ordinator in a nursing home in nearby Littlestone-on-Sea. They have two children, Rhys, five, and Jack, born just under three months ago. Dave has a sideline as an amateur magician. His cupboards are peppered with instruction DVDs hosted by American conjurers; presumably thanks to Dungeness's lack of competing distractions, his mastery of card tricks has been honed to perfection. \"I don't think I would be able to sleep without that power station there,\" he tells me. \"Very often,\" Janice says, \"it's got a very odd hum to it. It's difficult to describe.\" \"When we have a window open of an evening… It's like a car ticking over, only very faint,\" says Dave. \"I listen to it as I'm drifting off.\" Like most of the people here, the couple were raised in and around the area whose eastern edge stretches through nearby New Romney to Hythe – which makes them what the local argot calls \"Marshans\". Janice's father used to work at the power station; Dave has strong memories of repeated school trips to its visitors' centre, closed thanks to security worries in the aftermath of 9/11. But do they understand why some people might feel more twitchy about how close the power stations are to their homes? \"I can understand why people are a little bit funny about it,\" Dave says. \"Three-eyed fishes on the Simpsons and all that…\" \"I get it all the time at work: 'Are you glowing yet?'\" Janice says. \"As weird as it sounds,\" Dave adds, \"when I first went to the visitors' centre, they had a display telling you how electricity's made: that it's like boiling a kettle, and the steam turns the turbine blades. I must have been seven or eight. And for years I always imagined a huge kettle sat in there. Sometimes I look at it now and think, 'There could be a big kettle in there.' That's about how threatened I feel.\" A few doors away are Hannah Smith and Joe Ward, both 30. He is a maintenance man on a caravan site in Rye; she's a mature student, doing a degree in social work. Upstairs, asleep, are 10-year-old Joshua and two-year-old Devan. \"If you live this close to a power station,\" Joe says, \"you know that if anything happened to it, and it went up, you're not really going to know about it. And the closer you are, the quicker you're going to go, so the better it's going to be. \"Last summer,\" he adds, \"we had people with meters and stuff checking… They come round every so often. They're constantly taking checks themselves anyway; we've got friends who work there, and some of them do that.\" \"You always see people from the power station walking around Dungeness,\" Hannah says. \"Always.\" A lot of people resident in big cities, I suggest, would take one look at how close they are to the power stations and feel terrified. \"But I would be like that about living somewhere with so many cars,\" Hannah says. \"Oh my God, that's worse.\" \"The new people down here, who sold their houses and want to retire somewhere a bit quieter or get a holiday home, they might freak out a little bit,\" Joe says. \"But a lot of people are scared of the unknown, aren't they?\" As people who are opposed to nuclear power often do, it would be easy to take a brief look at life here and imagine no end of awful possibilities. As becomes clear within an hour of arriving, a dedicated police team makes regular circuits of the village, looking out for security threats. Every Christmas, the owners of Dungeness B send local residents a calendar, featuring safety instructions to be followed in the event of a serious accident, built around the imperatives to \"Go in\", \"Stay in\" and \"Tune in\" (to local radio). Everyone who lives here well knows that in the event of a release of radiation, they will also have to visit a nearby chemist quickly and stock up on potassium iodide tablets. Of late, particularly apocalyptic scenarios have been conjured up by people campaigning against the mooted extension of nearby Lydd airport, who have put up posters featuring the slogan \"60 seconds to disaster\" and suggested that, either by accident or design, airliners might one day crash into the power station. But as with most of the supposed threats to local safety, this all tends to get batted away with brief rebuttals of the idea of looming disaster, followed by very British summaries of the futility of worrying: \"You might get hit by a bus tomorrow\" is a line you hear a lot. In fairness, however, if the residents of RNSSS Cottages sound almost comically unconcerned about such supposed threats, they have good reason. Though Dungeness B was bedevilled by no end of design problems and cost overruns, like 99% of the world's nuclear plants, both power stations have an admirable safety record – so good, in fact, that local people enthusiastically lobbied for one of the next generation of British nuclear plants to be sited here, only to be turned down, ostensibly because of the surrounding land's status as a nature reserve. That said, from time to time, there have been the kind of minor incidents and accidents that happen in any plant of this scale. In 2009, for example, there was a fire in an annexe unit in Dungeness B, subsequently rated as a Level 1 incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale (Level 7 is the highest, representing Chernobyl-esque disaster). No one was injured and there was no release of radioactivity, though what happened caused a noticeable local kerfuffle. \"I was upstairs feeding my baby,\" Hannah says, \"and we saw all the fire engines and that coming round.\" \"I actually know what happened,\" Joe says. \"A hydraulic pipe burst, and because of the pressure of the oil coming out of the pipe, it caught fire, and you sort of ended up with a 12ft flame-thrower, melting everything in its path: you had steel pipes just turning into liquid. They panicked and hit the button and did an emergency shutdown – which we knew about, because it started at two in the morning and didn't finish till eight in the morning. There were about 24 fire engines.\" And what did they think? \"It could have been anything: a drill, or a fire outside, where someone had been welding. It's one of those: you wait until you see one of the blokes that works there and say, 'What was that?' If it was anything serious, you'd get a call, or a text, and there'd be people coming to tell you. So we haven't really got anything to worry about. And if anything that bad did happen, we're that close that…\" \"You wouldn't care anyway,\" Hannah says. \"You'd be gone,\" Joe says. The next morning, I meet 30-year-old Carrie Collins and her other half, 52-year-old Simon. He is an accredited Marshan, who has been a local lifeboatman for more than 20 years; she was born and raised in Weston-super-Mare, and eventually found herself, with three kids, in a housing estate in Stoke-on-Trent. She made contact with Simon via an AOL chatroom; after two visits to Dungeness, she decided to move down here, much to the bafflement of her family and friends. \"They all hate it,\" she says. \"They couldn't imagine living here. My best friend drove me down here when we moved, in a van. She was like, 'I couldn't live here – it's horrible.' She didn't like the sparseness of it; she couldn't see how people survived, and she couldn't imagine living next door to a power station. But it didn't register with me.\" She glances at a window at the rear of the house and the towering buildings that are essentially at the bottom of their garden. \"We never gave it a second thought,\" she says. \"It's out of the way here, isn't it?\" she goes on. \"I moved here from a council estate, which I hated. I lived there for nine years. Noise, fights all the time, nosy people, kids not being safe – that was the main one. They're safe here. I can send them out, the neighbours all keep their eye on them. You don't even have to ask them; it's just an instant thing. Whereas I used to have to keep them in the garden in Stoke, in case they got hit by a car or… do you know what I mean?... got taken off by someone. I reckon my oldest son would've had an asbo by now, with some of the kids he was hanging out with. But it's a better way of living here.\" This, rather than any nuclear dangers, is the kind of thing the people who live at RNSSS Cottages talk endlessly about. The social life here is built around a core of people who are linked by family ties and friendships going back to childhood. For all that the reference points of their lives – Xboxes, satellite TV, Facebook – are as 21st-century as you would expect, the way that doors are left open and neighbours relate to each other with an easy intimacy might remind you of the world of three decades ago. Millie Ward, Joe's sister, has lived here with her partner and two children since Janice, an old schoolfriend, tipped her off about a vacant cottage. \"In the summer it's like a commune,\" she says. \"If there's a kid causing havoc outside, you shout at 'em. Doesn't matter whose they are – they need telling off, you tell 'em off. If someone's hungry and their mum's not around, you give them a packet of crisps. If someone fancies a barbecue, we'll club together and take over someone's garden.\" One thing, I tell her, has been bugging me. Within eight hours of arriving in Dungeness, it starts to do funny things to your head. Places this flat tend to feel full of an unfathomable mystery, but they're also inescapably bleak. The lack of streetlights and constant wind compound the feeling. And I wonder: do people here not have moments of feeling isolated? \"Yeah, but it's great,\" she says. \"Dungeness is so unique. It's got its own natural beauty. In every season it looks different, but it's got the same beauty there. There's something melancholy and passionate about it in the winter, and in the summer, when the wind drops and you've got baking, blazing blue sky. I absolutely love it here.\" So, as far as I can tell, does everybody I speak to – and as strange as it may seem, their attachment to the place extends to the industrial leviathan that so defines the local landscape. \"The power stations suit Dungeness,\" Dave says. \"You see these bits of rusty fishing boats on the beach, and hoists to lift them up, which are falling apart. There's something beautiful about them. And then you look at the power stations, and for some reason, they kind of reflect that. And everything just fits in, somehow.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2014/apr/01/guardian-weekly-notes-and-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-01T12:58:00Z","webTitle":"Political science?

Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday gave the green light for two nuclear reactors at Kyushu Electric Power's Sendai plant in south-west Japan to restart, but communities are anxious over the safety aspects. The nuclear industry in Japan has been mothballed since the meltdown. At a temporary housing complex in Fukushima prefecture one resident, Iiko Kanno, said she now spends her days reading, growing vegetables and counting the days until she is reunited with her grandchildren. As with many of her neighbours, Kanno's family has been torn apart by the nuclear meltdown, which happened in March 2011. \"It wasn't until about a month after the nuclear disaster that we got the order to evacuate,\" Kanno said of her contaminated former home, Iitate, a picturesque, but now abandoned, village 24 miles north-west of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. \"Our family's vegetable farm was worthless, and we were told it was no longer safe to stay in Iitate.\" Most of Iitate's 6,000 residents stayed in the village after the disaster, convinced they were safe since their homes were outside the 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone imposed by the government. The local authorities did not order an evacuation until several weeks later, after a radiation expert discovered multiple radioactive hotspots at levels higher than those considered safe for human habitation. About 150 residents ended up in the temporary complex on the outskirts of Fukushima city, living in cramped wooden lodges surrounded by cherry, peach and apple trees. Three and a half years after the disaster, Iitate remains uninhabited, apart from decontamination workers and residents desperate to save their irradiated farms. In spending her twilight years in imposed isolation, and with little prospect of returning to her hometown, Kanno, 78, is far from alone among the estimated 120,000 people from the Fukushima area who continue to live in nuclear limbo. A survey conducted this year by the prefectural government found that almost half of the households forced to evacuate were living apart, while almost 70% had relatives suffering from physical and mental health problems. Of the total, 48.9% of households said family members were living in two or more locations. Of that number, 58.6% said relatives who had once lived together had been scattered across three or more sites. In the same survey, 67.5% of households said they had relatives who were showing signs of physical or psychological distress. More than half of those afflicted said they had lost interest in activities they once enjoyed or that they had trouble sleeping. Kanno's plight is typical of many Fukushima families who lived together in large rural homes before the disaster. Her husband and mother died in the 12 months before north-east Japan was struck by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake, which triggered a tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people and caused the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Her 43-year-old son, Futoshi, moved to Saitama, near Tokyo, with his wife and their young son. \"In Iitate it was normal for three generations of the same family to live under one roof,\" she said. \"My son initially found work in Fukushima city, but he and his wife didn't want to bring up their children in an area with high radiation. They won't bring him here to see me, so I only get to see them at the new year and on other special occasions.\" Her daughter and three other grandchildren, who lived in a nearby town in Fukushima, are now some distance away, in Niigata prefecture. Her daughter's husband, a teacher, still works in Fukushima and commutes to his family's new home every weekend. For people of Kanno's generation, the prospect of playing next to no part in her grandchildren's upbringing is almost unimaginable. \"If we had been able to stay in Iitate we would all be living together now,\" she says. \"I was practically brought up by my grandparents, and my parents helped raise my children. But radiation has made that impossible now.\" Kanno was depressed for months after the accident, and is still unable to sleep without medication. \"If I don't take it, I lie awake gazing at my grandson's photo, wondering how much I'll get to see of him before he's an adult.\" Iitate's mayor, Norio Kanno, has vowed that decontamination work will make the village inhabitable again, possibly by 2016. But residents say the problem of cleaning the village's mountainous terrain, which sends radioactive particles into residential areas below after rainfall, makes that unlikely. So far only a few hundred people from two districts on the eastern edge of the evacuation zone have been given permission to return permanently. \"It could be years before we can return, so families had to make a tough choice,\" says Hanako Hasegawa, an Iitate resident who helps at a drop-in centre for evacuees. Her husband makes brief returns to clean the home they once shared with their children and grandchildren, while other residents have seen their abandoned homes become overrun with mould and vermin. \"People who go back return saying it's a sad place to be now,\" says Hasegawa. \"Yet they still go back to weed the garden and tidy homes they will probably never live in.\" The once close-knit residents are now part of Japan's nuclear diaspora. Most stay in parts of Fukushima prefecture not affected by the evacuation order; the remainder are scattered among all but two of Japan's 46 other prefectures, according to village records. Four have made new lives overseas. Hasegawa, whose family ran a dairy farm, are dispersed across four locations. Typically, fathers leave in search of work and children move out of Fukushima with their mothers, while grandparents stay put, reluctant to venture far from their hometowns near the end of their lives. The average age of the residents of this temporary housing complex is 66; of those in their 70s and 80s, about 20 are living alone. \"If my son didn't bring my granddaughter here, I would never get to see her,\" Hasegawa says. \"There are lots of older people here in the same situation. Younger members of the family come for special occasions, like festivals and sports days, then leave straight after.\" Kanno and her neighbours keep fit with morning calisthenics, and try to maintain community ties fractured by the events at Fukushima Daiichi, a two-hour drive away, with tea afternoons, craft workshops and coach trips. \"The nuclear accident turned everything upside down,\" she said. \"Even if the evacuation order is lifted, no young people or children will go back. We have asked everyone – the village office, decontamination workers, environment ministry bureaucrats – when it will be safe to return. But no one can give us an answer.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2014/dec/08/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-dividing-europe-cecilia-malmstroem-washington-debut","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-08T13:46:36Z","webTitle":"TTIP divides a continent as EU negotiators cross the Atlantic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/08/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-dividing-europe-cecilia-malmstroem-washington-debut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/dec/08/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-dividing-europe-cecilia-malmstroem-washington-debut","fields":{"headline":"TTIP divides a continent as EU negotiators cross the Atlantic","bodyText":"Rarely has a trade agreement invited such hyperbole and paranoia. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – or proposed free trade pact between the US and the European Union – has triggered apocalyptic prophecies: the death of French culture; an invasion of transatlantic toxic chickens into Germany; and Britain’s cherished NHS will become a stripped-down Medicare clone. From the point of view of free-trade cheerleaders, EU carmakers will more than double their sales, Europe will be seized by a jobs and growth bonanza and city halls from Chicago to Seattle will beg European firms to build their roads and schools. The world’s biggest trading nations will have no choice but to play by the west’s rules in the new world created by TTIP. Such are some of the claims made for TTIP which is now stoking a propaganda war on a scale never seen before in the arcane world of tariffs and non-tariff trade negotiations. “It’s the most contested acronym in Europe,” said Cecilia Malmström of Sweden, the EU trade commissioner about to take charge of the European side of the negotiations. She stepped into the fray on Sunday, her first trip to Washington since taking up her post in November. TTIP dominates her intray. Eighteen months after the launch and seven rounds of talks, everything remains up in the air. The Americans are worried. Those in Brussels running the negotiations sound crestfallen. The opposition in Europe to a transatlantic free trade area believes it has the momentum, buoyed by scare stories regularly amplified by the European media. A petition against the trade pact surpassed the 1m mark this week. It will be handed to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission chief, in Brussels on Tuesday, as a present on his 60th birthday. “There is mistrust,” Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador in London, told the Guardian. A key EU official put it another way: “[TTIP is] more sensitive politically in Europe than in the US.” Over the past 18 months, both sides have been setting out their shopping lists. The hard talks will take place between February and July 2015 as the contours of a deal become clearer. “The real negotiations haven’t really started yet,” said Malmström. “But the real point with TTIP is to have an ambitious agreement. There’s no point just doing the low-hanging fruit.” The Americans want to conclude the pact within a year while Barack Obama is still in the White House. The Europeans would also like this, but appear less stressed about the deadline. “We’re not in a hurry. I’m here for five years,” said Malmström. “But if we get the skeletons done under Obama, that will be fantastic.” The easy bit, say those involved in the talks, will be the removal of tariffs and duties on goods whichonly amount to 3% of their aggregate value. Eighty percent of the perceived benefits would come from a breakthrough on non-tariff barriers, which could usher in the harmonisation of transatlantic standards and regulations on everything from food labelling and drugs-testing to the manufacture of cars or electrical components. The Europeans want access to financial services in the US, Washington is resisting. Brussels also insists on equal access to public procurement tendering and contracts in the US. And it wants to protect European foodstuffs through the protective system that decides what can be called champagne or camembert, Parma ham, or scotch whisky. “Geographical indicators are very important to the EU. The US has different ideas,” said Malmström. “The Americans are a little bit surprised we think their foods are inferior. They don’t understand why we feel so superior,” said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch liberal MEP on the parliament’s trade committee. In an attempt to counter what US ambassador Barzun describes as “myths” and “scaremongering” in Europe about aspects of the proposed pact, both sides emphasise there is nothing in the talks that could facilitate the privatisation of public services such as the NHS.Audio-visual services have also been excluded to appease French fears of Hollywood and Silicon Valley decimating the French film and television industries. American hormone-fed beef, GM foods, or chlorine-washed chickens will not be allowed in Europe, the European commission maintains, for as long as they are proscribed in the EU. And yet senior commission officials admit they are fighting a losing battle against a tide of hostile and “emotional” public opinion that has taken them by surprise and that they are ill-equipped to counter. “I need to try to understand the scepticism, the fears,” said Malmstroem. Resistance is most acute in Germany, as well as in Austria and France. The European slump and currency crisis of the last five years has sapped confidence in governing elites, sown fear of globalisation, and a mistrust of the corporate world and marauding, tax-avoiding multinationals. The Snowden and NSA mass surveillance scandals have eroded faith in the Americans and strained transatlantic relations, especially in Germany, where the Americans were found to be tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone. Around 200 questions have been tabled in the German parliament on aspects of TTIP, reflecting how MPs have been besieged by their constituents. Germany is by far Europe’s biggest exporter and has most to gain from a transatlantic free trade area. EU car exports to the US, for example, could soar by 150% if a satisfactory deal is struck, say negotiators. Germany is Europe’s biggest carmaker.But another reason for German ambivalence is complacency, that Berlin is happy with the way things are, that it is not worth the risk of a popular backlash. Merkel is widely seen as risk-averse, a keen student of opinion polls and not known to get too far ahead of public opinion in her policy-making. The biggest issue in the talks and the focus of the growing opposition to the pact is a touchstone for all these inchoate fears – investor protection, or the system known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which allows companies to bypass national courts and sue governments for damages on lost investments in extra-territorial arbitration panels. For the critics, this amounts to a surrender of national political sovereignty to the deep-pocketed multinationals, with business, not government, setting the rules of international trade. This apprehension is not necessarily rational, but it is very potent. The ISDS system has existed for almost half a century, and there are 9,000 such agreements operating globally, 1,400 of them in the EU. Although Germany has practised the system since 1969, Germany remains the biggest opponent of writing ISDS in to the trade pact, perhaps because Vattenfall, the Swedish energy giant, is suing Berlin for billions in damages following Merkel’s decision to abandon nuclear power. “At the end of the day there’s a risk this agreement is going into troubled waters because of ISDS,” said Bernd Lange, the German social democrat who chairs the European parliament’s trade committee. Reflecting the German position, Juncker has said he wants no ISDS mechanism in the trade agreement. Malmström is known to favour a “reformed” version of ISDS. The EU’s biggest trade pact to date – an agreement with Canada concluded in August – includes ISDS, setting a precedent for the US deal. Malmström was humiliatedlast month when Juncker’s staff contradicted her position and Juncker took authority for ISDS out of her remit, handing it instead to Frans Timmermans, the new commission’s powerful number two. Given the widespread and growing opposition, Malmström has quickly concluded that perhaps the only way to tackle the scepticism is to moderate the secrecy surrounding the negotiations and launch a new campaign of glasnost. After a year of rejecting demands, the commission has published her negotiating mandate from the EU’s 28 governments. Her negotiating proposals, though not the outcome of the specific talks chapters, are now to be made public, and MEPs are to be given access to restricted documents. Lange complains that only 13 of 751 MEPs are currently allowed to see sensitive paperwork. Malmström said all MEPs will soon have access. However, there will be limits to Malmstroem’s transparency. “In a negotiation, you have to let the negotiators negotiate,” said one senior official. Taking office this week as the new president of the European Council, chairing summits and mediating between national leaders, Donald Tusk, Poland’s former prime minister, singled out TTIP as one of his main priorities for the year ahead. The Europeans argue that with the world trade agreement talks stuck, the TTIP offers a chance to break the deadlock and fasten down high standards of consumer, environmental, and legal safety that China and the emerging economies will be forced to emulate. “This is the mother of all agreements. It’s a huge market and the EU needs growth desperately,” said Malmström. “Europe’s role in the world is waning. Growth will come from outside. And this will set global standards for the rest of the world.” The pact will prove an uphill struggle in a jaundiced Europe fed up with its political and business elites."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/09/scotland-independence-vote-us-headache","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-09T11:31:48Z","webTitle":"'Scotland's what?'

US caught napping as Scots prepare to vote on independence","bodyText":"“Scotland’s what?” said the Department of Defense switchboard operator in apparent confusion. Scotland is voting on independence, the Guardian told her. “Oh.” A brief silence. “Wow.” The buzz in Washington about Scotland’s proposed independence from the United Kingdom, even as a shock new poll this weekend showed the Yes campaign ahead 51% to 49%, is that there is practically no buzz in Washington. But if Scotland votes for independence from the United Kingdom on 18 September it will have serious policy ramifications for the United States. First among these is the fate of the 58 Trident II D5 missiles leased from the US by the British government that have served as the UK’s primary deterrent against nuclear attack since 1990, and the four Vanguard-class submarines which carry them. There are other important questions too, ones about maintaining the balance of power in Nato; the relationship between the UK and the European Union, which could be jeopardised; and the larger foreign policy effect of a weakened United Kingdom. Nonetheless, when asked for comment in July, the US official reaction was, essentially, no response at all. Lt Vanessa Hillman, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense (DoD), told the Guardian that this was “not something the DoD would take queries on”, and referred questions to the State Department. The State Department, getting a little testy – the Guardian asked the same question three times over the course of a week – said: “We don’t have anything on this at this point.” The White House, when asked about contingency plans, referred to President Obama’s remarks at the G7 summit in Brussels in June, when he commented that the United Kingdom worked “pretty well, and we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains strong, robust, united and effective partner.” When pressed further, the White House said: “We’re not going to comment beyond the president’s remarks. Thanks!” “Washington as a whole is not generally aware that there’s even a referendum,” said James Acton, a senior associate in the nuclear policy program at the Washington DC-based Carnegie Endowment. “Most of the people who are dimly aware of it are assuming that the better together camp is going to win. I think there’s not been much deep thinking here about the ramifications of Scottish independence.” Ian Wallace, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, believes the stand-offish unwillingness of US institutions to comment is a strategic position. “[There is] an awareness that anything that might be seen as US interference into a Scottish decision would probably be counter-productive. There’s a desire to keep from doing anything that would undermine the case for keeping Britain together.” But there are several facets of Scottish independence that could cause headaches for the US. Acton, whose background is in nuclear physics, said that DC’s “nuclear community” was worried about what might happen to Trident, which Alex Salmond, the current First Minister of Scotland and the chief campaigner for independence, has pledged to kick out of their current base on the west coast of Scotland. There is some worry in US nuclear policy circles that Scottish independence could lead to the UK abandoning its nuclear program altogether. America very much doesn’t want that, said Acton. “The US is quietly very keen for the UK to remain a nuclear weapon state. They do not want to be the sole nuclear power in Nato.” (While France is a nuclear weapon state and an otherwise full member of the Nato command structure, it does not contribute use of its nuclear weapons to the alliance and does not attend meetings of the Nuclear Planning Group.) The missiles that form the UK’s nuclear deterrent are leased from the American Atlantic Squadron pool, which is based at the US naval base at King’s Bay, on the Georgia coast, where America houses its own Trident submarines. Acton thinks there is a possibility that the warheads, and possibly even the submarines, might have to be stored back at King’s Bay – at least temporarily – if an independent Scotland goes through with the Scottish National Party’s stated policy of ejecting them. “I think it would be an interim solution,” he said, “but might end up becoming permanent.” “The bottom line – from our point of view – is that the Scottish government position is that it wants the fastest safe removal of Trident submarines,” said Stuart McDonald, a senior researcher for the Yes to Independence campaign. Acton said that one way the situation could play out would be for pressure to be applied – including by the US government – using the possibility of Scottish membership in Nato as a bargaining chip to make the Scots agree to a long-term lease on the Trident base. McDonald, however, believes this is unlikely. “To say that there is a strong opposition to nuclear weapons in Scotland,” he added, “is understating the case.” Franklin Miller, a former senior US defence official who spent 31 years working at the DoD, the Department of State and the White House, told the Guardian that the consequences for Nato would be grave. “The SNP position, that it will force the UK out of Faslane, thereby putting in peril the very existence of the UK [nuclear] deterrent, undercuts a key provision of the alliance, which is based on the nuclear guarantee provided by the US and the UK. If an independent Scotland were to knock out one of those two legs, it would cut to the heart of that doctrine, and isolate the US as the only nuclear provider for Nato,” he said. “Not a good thing.” The Scottish National Party voted two years ago that an independent Scotland would apply to join Nato, but the issue of Scotland’s membership is deeply in doubt. “Would an independent Scotland be another free rider on US security guarantees?” Dr Tim Oliver, of the Center for Transatlantic Relations, asked. “The US is frustrated enough already at the number of bonsai armies in Europe. There wouldn’t be much expectation that Scotland could do anything in Nato.” Oliver also said he thought there was an issue of international trust at stake. “The US fought one of the bloodiest wars in their history to hold its union together,” he said. “They can’t take the UK seriously if they just let their union fade.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/08/nick-clegg-taunts-david-cameron-on-green-crap","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T12:48:28Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg taunts David Cameron on 'green crap' | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/08/nick-clegg-taunts-david-cameron-on-green-crap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/08/nick-clegg-taunts-david-cameron-on-green-crap","fields":{"headline":"Nick Clegg taunts David Cameron on 'green crap'","bodyText":"The heart of the LibDem green offer to voters at the general election is its five “green laws”. Nick Clegg, addressing his party conference summarised them like this: “Laws that will commit British governments to reducing carbon from our electricity sector. Create new, legal targets for clean air and water. Give everyone access to green space. Massively boost energy efficiency and renewable energy. Prioritise the shift to green cars. Bring an end to dirty coal.” As Clegg also said, rather more pithily: “It’s not green crap to us.” Energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey told delegates: “The five green laws are the most radical green offer ever made by a political party.” So it is strange how little talk there has been of the green laws at the conference. Legal targets to finally clean up the polluted air in our cities could, if effective, be transformative, but they have been barely mentioned. One delegate from the conference floor warned the party that unless the laws were put front and centre of the Lib Dems campaigning it would be seen only as “window dressing”. I think he had a point: the laws were rather quietly announced on 1 September, as people stumbled back from summer holidays, not how you would release a blockbuster policy. As a party potentially facing electoral armageddon, the Lib Dems seem have decided attack is the best form of defence. It works well for a junior coalition partner: blame the other side for all that’s gone wrong, claim the credit for what went right. And there were plenty of potshots at the Conservatives in Glasgow, many from Davey who said he had been waging an “insurgent battle”. Some hit the bullseye. “I still have to battle Eric Pickles on onshore wind. It has been growing fast under us ... But the Tories don’t like this. Day after day they’ve urged me to cap onshore wind. I’ve just said no,” Davey said, noting that onshore wind, being the cheapest green energy, helps keeps bills and carbon down. There was a second salvo against the communities secretary. “Mr Pickles – who claims to be a champion of localism – has been calling in every onshore wind planning application he can [over 50 to date]. Interfering with the independent Planning Inspectorate process. Over-riding decisions of elected councillors. Mr Pickles is in danger of bringing the planning system into disrepute. Of abusing ministerial power.” I quite agree. Davey also took aim at the Tory obsession with fracking. “I have had to hold back the Tories’ desire to frack every square mile of Britain. Ensuring that gas exploration is safe. Protecting our national parks, areas of outstanding beauty and world heritage sites.” It’s true that many senior Conservatives have overhyped shale gas, but it’s also true that Davey’s department, under Liberal Democrat control for the entire parliament, is allowing fracking in national parks and scrapping trespass laws allowing homeowners to object to drilling under their feet. And he remains a happy fracker: “I’d far rather use Britain’s gas, than Putin’s gas. Or even Middle East gas.” Davey had some new announcements, most welcome after the tumbleweed blowing through the Tory party conference on green policy. But with power has come the responsibility to be held to account for your record, and that record rather undermines some of the new ideas. “Coal is the climate destroyer. [So] we will legislate to ban the generation of electricity from coal from 2025,” Davey said. But late on Friday his policy to ensure the lights stay on was revealed as set to give billions in subsidy to old coal plants. Davey also dragged an extra £100m from the Treasury – no mean feat – to incentivise the failing green deal energy efficiency programme. The good news is we know it works. There was such a rush for the first round, Davey had to slam the door shut in July. The bad news is the industry immediately criticised it as a sticking plaster until the election and said stop-start policies just damage business confidence. Even LibDem MPs admit privately that the green deal has flopped. Davey re-announced the LibDem proposal to give a £100 a year discount off council tax for homeowners who boost the energy efficiency of their homes by two energy bands. Will Labour’s offer of a million interest-free loans for green upgrades be more appealing? I’ll let you decide. Davey claimed credit for the UK’s first community energy strategy. Community energy is vital as it engages people and obliterates nimbyism. But why did the LidDem-run department wait till the the final year of government to get it going? There was praise for Davey, who said he had “bunked off” the conference, to meet European energy ministers negotiating the EU’s crucial 2030 energy and climate deal: the UK had been a “leader”, said those attending. But it was a little undermined by news on the same day that the European Commission was ditching its attempt to label oil from Canadian tar sands as highly polluting: the UK had secretly given high level help to Canada to defeat the plan. Governing in coalition is hard and compromises abound. A handy example is the decision today by the European Union to give state aid approval for the multi-billion subsidy package Davey has granted EDF to build a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point. Their anti-nuclear stance has been one of the sacred cows slaughtered on the altar of coalition by the LibDems: in 2006 Davey said nuclear was only “possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market”. He says the reason for his U-turn is simple - climate change – but he still can’t say whether nuclear will compete without subsidies. “Do I think [subsidies for nuclear] will go to zero? I don’t know, because I can’t tell the future,” he told me. “But what I do know is that [the policies] we’ve got will reduce the cost of supporting low-carbon, in all its different forms, to the lowest imaginable because we are bringing in competition in the market.” The Lib Dems have a decent overall record on energy and climate change – doubling renewable energy - and new thoughts with which to go forward. But they haven’t been held back in their ambition by the Conservatives quite as much as they like to portray. Davey’s former minister, the Conservative Greg Barker, provocatively said recently that Davey is “a bit right-wing for me. I would favour slightly more radical market interventions.” How to balance markets and regulation in delivering a low-carbon economy is the key question in energy and environment policy. Voters will judge whether the Lib Dem-led department of energy and climate change got that balance right. Badger cull The Conservatives have committed to continuing the badger cull, intended to curb TB in cattle, and Labour have committed to ending it. The Lib Dem position sits in the middle which is, well, very Lib Dem. Baroness Parminter, the Lib Dem spokeswoman in the Lords, would not rule out continuing the cull pilots, but her remarks also indicated that the night-time shoots are on very shaky ground. The Lib Dem position was, she said: “We will not allow the culls to be extended if they are not proved safe, humane, effective.” The independent panel, now disbanded, found the 2013 culls were neither effective nor humane. Parminter said the lack of independent oversight in 2014 is a worry, as it meant the different sides of the debate might not have confidence in the cull result. It isn’t clear what that all meant for Lib Dem policy on the cull. I would have asked the environment minister Dan Rogerson, but he didn’t turn up to the environment Q&amp;A session."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2014/jul/01/britain-robotics-test-centre-strategy-robots","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-30T23:02:00Z","webTitle":"Britain hopes to catch up in global robotics race with test centre strategy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/01/britain-robotics-test-centre-strategy-robots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/jul/01/britain-robotics-test-centre-strategy-robots","fields":{"headline":"Britain hopes to catch up in global robotics race with test centre strategy","bodyText":"Factories, farms, lakes and towns will become proving grounds for robots, drones and driverless cars under plans handed to the government on Tuesday that would transform Britain into a leading test centre for the machines. Decommissioned nuclear plants at Sellafield, the nation's deepest mine at Boulby in Yorkshire and Loch Linnhe near Fort William are among places being eyed up as facilities to put the next generation of robots through their paces. The strategy would see airfields co-opted for experimental drone flights and towns such as Milton Keynes used as tough urban proving grounds for driverless cars, where navigation, object-avoidance and automated parking can be tested to the limit. Unveiled in the UK's first official robotics strategy, the proposals aim to increase Britain's income from robotics and so-called autonomous systems (RAS) which can perform certain tasks without human operators. The plans, drawn up by the government's Technology Strategy Board, foresee around a dozen proving grounds where companies and researchers can test their robots in real-world situations to make sure they work properly and are safe for humans to be around. Once the testbeds are established, they will host a series of challenges that set robots specific tasks. These will be designed to drive new technologies, and could include a deep-water search for an aircraft black box, the dismantling of equipment in a nuclear plant, smart route-finding to parking places, or the ability to move a sick patient in their home. \"If we are going to have robots interacting with people we need to make sure they work properly, but we also need to understand how people behave around them. We need to get used to the idea of working with robots,\" said David Lane, chair of the Technology Strategy Board's RAS special interest group. RAS is one of the eight technologies the chancellor, George Osborne, is banking on to drive UK growth, but other countries, including Japan, the US, South Korea and Germany, are dominant in the market, which could be worth £70bn by 2025 according to a McKinsey report last year. \"It's important we don't dilly-dally, because the race is on,\" said Lane. Speaking before the announcement of the strategy, science minister David Willetts said: \"We're very keen for people to come up with ideas for robot enterprise zones where you can try them out in a controlled environment. Over the months ahead we'll work with the experts to see where there are public expenditure costs, what they are and [whether they are] affordable,\" he added. In total, the government invests about £150m in RAS. For robotics to become a leading driver of the UK economy, the regulatory environment has to move with the demands of the technology. That means adapting rules to allow drones to fly in civilian airspace and driverless cars to take to the roads. According to Lane, the regulators are making progress: \"They are up for it. In one sense they have no choice, because they know this is coming.\" The country's long history of offshore oil and gas exploration has led to homegrown expertise in submersible robots for maintenance and inspection. As one of the first countries to decommission nuclear power stations, there are facilities becoming available where robots could be developed to work in the grim conditions that faced Japanese operators at the Fukushima Daiichi plant after it was crippled by the 2011 tsunami. Though robots are most often built to do jobs that are dull, dangerous or dirty, the challenge in making them work lies in the specifics. In a deep mine, a robot needs to not only cope with the hot conditions but with fine particles that can wear down robotic limbs. In a nuclear plant, a robot might need radiation protection, but also be able to manoeuvre in tight and complex spaces. Urban environments are no easier. A robot road-cleaner needs to sweep the streets, avoid pedestrians and other objects, but also complete its route unscathed. \"You have to engineer a robot for the environment it's going into. If you're going to put it into Glasgow city centre on Friday night, it's the same principle,\" said Lane. Rather than Amazon deliveries of books, mooted by the online firm last year, some of the first commercial uses of drones could be on farms, to monitor crops and deliver pesticides. Farms have the advantage of being on private, isolated land, where the risk of accidents is lower than in towns and cities. \"Shifting a hardback Harry Potter volume will require a fair amount of power, and that, if it crashed or went awry, could seriously harm people. I think we are a long way off the Amazon book delivery. The whole area of liability is going to be important,\" said Willetts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/05/subsidy-cuts-and-weak-eu-targets-cloud-german-solar-energy-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-05T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"German solar ambitions at risk from cuts to subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/05/subsidy-cuts-and-weak-eu-targets-cloud-german-solar-energy-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/05/subsidy-cuts-and-weak-eu-targets-cloud-german-solar-energy-revolution","fields":{"headline":"German solar ambitions at risk from cuts to subsidies","bodyText":"German ambitions to generate the vast majority of its power from the sun, wind and other renewable sources by the middle of the century are at risk from cuts to solar subsidies and weak EU clean energy targets, industry and experts say. The country’s target of getting 80% of energy from renewable sources by 2050 is one of the few to match the scaling-up of renewable power that the UN’s climate science panel said on Sunday was needed to avoid “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” from global warming.The Energiewende (‘Energy transition’) programme to chisel fossil fuels out of Germany’s energy mix has a breathtakingly ambitious air that has swept through the north city-state of Bremen, where even the football stadiums and funfairs run entirely on clean energy. In 2008, shortly after the EU set its green energy targets for 2020, the Freimarkt funfair and Werder Bremen football club both switched to renewable power, with the club completely renovating its stadium in a business deal with energy company EWE. “Our colours are green and white,” said Klaus Filbry, the managing director of Werder Bremen, which is home to Europe’s first and largest solar-powered football stadium. “The green stands for being environmentally conscious and the white stands for peace. It is important for us. We get a lot of support from the community and we want to give back to them. All the electricity we produce goes into the grid system.” Fans can sign up to buy 1% of their electricity from the stadium, which with a solar capacity of 1.2MW produces enough surplus energy to power 400-500 houses a year. The better the team perform, the lower the electricity tariff, although this is not a selling point for Bremen fans this year. The Weser Stadium is armadillo-plated with 200,000 single module solar cells that resemble a huge postmodern lampshade. Next to it is a solar-powered restaurant. Not all the Werder Bremen players were initially excited by the green makeover. But Clemens Fritz, the team captain, told the Guardian: “When I heard that the stadium would be transformed into a ‘futuristic spacecraft’ I was delighted that it would not only look fantastic but also generate environmentally friendly energy.” “The whole facade and roof were built for €11.5m,” according to EWE spokesman and Bremen fan, Christian Bartsche. “Economically, it just breaks even but in marketing terms it has such a positive image that it is a plus for us. The Weser Stadium is like a lighthouse that anyone can see as they fly into Bremen. It lights up the region.” Bremen is not alone. The nearby state of Schleswig-Holstein is close to producing all of its electricity from wind power, and Germany as a whole is aiming for 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Filbry said he could imagine a club attaching wind turbines to its floodlights. “Like us, it would have a unique visibility and it could work – especially in an area where there’s a lot of wind,” he said But in the solar industry, falling solar panel costs spurred by Chinese mass production have sucked almost half of the jobs out of a sector that employed 100,000 people in 2012. At the same time, cheaper solar has reduced retail prices, spurring consumer uptake but bringing cuts to public support schemes. Filbry said that the removal of tax incentives for solar had already affected all clubs with tie-ins to renewable energy firms: “A lot of those partnerships were finished because of changes to the law and that certainly had a financial effect that was felt in the league. Less money came in. Our sponsorship with one company went down from €500,000 to €200,000. We were able to compensate and find other partners but it did hurt the club financially.” Filbry admits that the club had less money to spend on players for a time but stoutly denies any link to the club’s current position at the bottom of the Bundesliga. Subsidy cutbacks have been felt across the industry, as the cost of solar power has fallen closer to the cost of fossil fuel energy. From a zenith of $0.90 per kilowatt hour, German feed-in-tariffs that pay people for generating energy from solar have fallen to around $0.20 per kwh today. The guaranteed 20-year tariff offered to early household investors is now a thing of the past. An EU state aid decision this year that solar had reached industrial ‘maturity’ will accelerate the subsidy tail-off in 2015. Anger is widespread in Germany that the EU commissioner responsible for the decision, Joaquín Almunia, allowed nuclear energy in the UK another 30 years of public backing. “It is completely irrational,” said Milan Nitzschke, the vice president of SolarWorld, one of the world’s largest solar panel manufacturers. The Bonn-based firm failed in a recent attempt to launch an EU anti-dumping case against Chinese manufacturers. “We don’t have subsidy free markets anywhere in the EU so why is the commission ruling against feed-in-tariffs for renewables in Germany while granting them in the UK for nuclear?” Nitzschke said. “The thinking is completely wrong. It is creating a less efficient system that only benefits major players with huge windfall effects.” The EU’s recent decision to mandate a 27% share for renewables across Europe by 2030 was “only symbolic, nothing more,” he added, as the commission would have no enforcement powers over member states. “But we know there is a need for renewables in every European energy market and solar is the upcoming cheapest energy source. We’re now at a level where we can compete with gas-fired plants when the sun shines, so solar will anyhow become one of the major electricity sources.” Frauke Thies, the energy policy director for the European Photovoltaic Industry Association told the Guardian, said: “Downsizing the EU’s political ambition for renewables now means stopping right before the finish-line. By slowing down the pace of renewables uptake, Europe risks being left behind in the global energy transition.” Last year, renewables provided around 24% of Germany’s electricity, but coal and lignite accounted for 45% - 2% up from 2011, when the country began switching off nuclear power plants in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. The phase-out is expected to complete in 2022, adding to a sense of urgency in the energiewende transition strategy. New innovations, such as an expensive Eqoo solar storage unit that EWE put on the market in April, are to provide somewhere to bank unused solar power. The Eqoo stores solar energy for around six hours but so far just 80 units have been sold. “You have to inform the public about it and convince them it’s a good idea,” Bartsche said. “You also have to find the first-time buyers, as customers who already have solar panels on their homes are getting enough money for their kilowatt hours.” With home-generated solar electricity around half the price charged by power companies, it makes more sense to use your own sunshine. At the Next Energy research lab in Oldenburg, thin-film solar panels are in development in a variety of colours. The flimsy panels are one micrometre thick – compared to 200-300 micrometres for traditional PV panels – and can be used for windowpanes and house tiles. Dr Thibo Kilper, Next Energy’s research manager says that commercial negotiations are underway and the product could be appearing in new house builds by 2016. But similar problems are holding the next-generation solar sector back. “A lot of partners for publicly-funded projects went bankrupt and disappeared from the market,” Kilper said. “It meant that many months and years of work were for nothing. It is a little frustrating but we have to be creative. We are looking at other European markets.” The EU’s relatively low 2030 target was “frustrating,” he said, as a dynamic market and clear public interest were not being allowed to grow as fast as possible. “There are strong lobbies from conventional fossil fuels working against us. This is clear,” agreed Dr Wedigo von Wedel, Next Energy’s head of energy storage division. “There needs to be some money and force behind our research to make the energiewende a reality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/sep/05/green-party-conference-media-ignores-them","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-05T16:56:51Z","webTitle":"Green party in buoyant mood as leaders focus on taking the fight to Labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/05/green-party-conference-media-ignores-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/sep/05/green-party-conference-media-ignores-them","fields":{"headline":"Green party in buoyant mood as leaders focus on taking the fight to Labour","bodyText":"Taxi drivers can normally rely on doing excellent business at party conferences, ferrying VIPs, delegates and lobbyists to and from the secure zone of the venue. But the drivers outside Birmingham's New Street station on Friday enjoyed no such boom. \"The Green party conference? Haven't heard of it,\" said Malik Gasam, one of the drivers in the scarcely moving rank. \"I haven't taken any fares for that.\" Instead, on the other side of the station, greener transport awaited: a small group of volunteers directing a steady stream of walkers bearing green badges and many in sloganned T-shirts to the venue for what promised to be one of the party's biggest conferences. More than 750 delegates were expected, most, but not all, members of their local organisation and at least 40% first time attendees, many of them new members who have swelled the party's ranks to a record 18,000 even as other political parties are losing members. The Greens are in feisty mood, buoyed by a good showing in the recent European elections, when they received more than 1.2m votes. Leaders are seeking to reposition the party as a leftwing alternative to Labour, with far more than just their stalwart environmental policies: a higher minimum wage than Labour is advocating; a halt to the \"creeping privatisation\" of the NHS; and the scrapping of tuition fees, including retrospectively on fees already paid. \"We are the real opposition,\" Caroline Lucas, the party's only MP, will tell delegates on Saturday. She will barely mention the governing coalition, focusing instead on a fight against Labour. Anthony Pearce of the Stafford and Stone branch agrees. \"I was a lifelong Labour supporter, over 30 years. But it became very difficult to see any difference between their policies and the Conservatives. Eventually I left and came to the Greens.\" Terry White made a similar journey from the Liberal Democrats. \"It was tuition fees,\" says White, 21. \"The Lib Dems were not in tune with young people.\" The Greens are currently polling at 6.6%, which is neck-and-neck with the Lib Dems. In hoping to challenge the UK's three-party hegemony at next year's general election, the Greens are strikingly similar to another small party on the other end of the political spectrum. But while Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party leader, is a familiar fixture on TV and front pages, the Greens have struggled to gain recognition. One of the key problems is the party's struggle – like Ukip's – to break beyond the perception of it as single-issue. \"We are called the Green party, and we have a lot of environmental policies,\" says Ankaret Harmer, a member in Birmingham. \"But actually it is a lot broader than that, though some people don't realise. We have policies on everything.\" \"There isn't enough awareness [among voters at large] of the range of policies we have, our social justice policies,\" says Rosie Pearce, aged 19, who studied all of the UK's political parties before deciding that Green policies most matched her outlook. \"We need to raise awareness of that.\" Pointedly, Lucas will spend only a few minutes on green issues – fracking, nuclear power and weapons – with the rest on the social justice policies. Money comes into it, too. Whereas the major party conferences are a boon for big business, with multinationals and lobbying groups, the Green party stalls include the Stop the War Coalition, Dignity in Dying, Friends of the Earth, the Quakers and a handful of others. Several trade unions are present, including the RMT, NUT and TUC. For years, the Greens also suffered from internal disorganisation. \"We were not nearly as organised as we should have been,\" says one delegate, who did not wish to be named. \"I've been told it was quite chaotic before. It's not like that now,\" says another new member. But the complaint that comes up most frequently from delegates is that the media ignores the Greens while lavishing attention on Ukip. \"If you look at the political parties that get the most coverage, they speak for business and the establishment. Media organisations are businesses and they follow that,\" says Terry White. Vicky Duckworth adds: \"There should be more coverage of us, we have done as well [electorally] as Ukip.\" \"It's because Ukip are the establishment, not challenging the establishment,\" says Rosie Pearce. \"We are scaring them.\" Penny Kemp, from London, says: \"It's not even just about Ukip – they [the media] should be giving us as much attention as they do the Lib Dems – we are polling the same as the Lib Dems, so why aren't we getting recognition for that?\" Ukip's policies and the Greens' could scarcely be more different. The Greens are pro-Europe and sympathetic to immigration, attacking policies they say hurt people on benefits such as the bedroom tax, strongly in favour of renewable energy. (One of Farage's favourite topics, after immigration and the economy, is wind farms. He doesn't like them.) In style, too, they are poles apart. The party's democratic structure would never permit the kind of brutal tactics employed by Farage, when he ousted Roger Lord as candidate for Clacton, in favour of the Tory defector, Douglas Carswell. (The disgruntled Lord warned in the Guardian: \"Can anyone really trust him? Would you really sign a treaty with this man?\") Demographically, Ukip's core support lies among older voters while the Greens appeal strongly to the young. \"Young people have suffered a real kicking from austerity,\" says Pearce. \"Our policies are very popular with the young,\" adds Vicky Duckworth. Sahaya James, aged 16, who joined nearly a year ago, agrees: \"We have very strong policies on issues that affect young people, like tuition fees, but also the NHS and creating high-quality jobs. I think young people do respond to what we have to say – we want a sustainable future.\" That may bode well in the longer term, but young people are less likely to vote in next year's general election. Women are also well-represented, with the party leader, MP and peer all women, and policies advocating gender equality. For the Greens, the last few years have been encouraging, with the first Green MP and peer, rising polls and new members. But the challenges the party will face in the general election are stark. Media interest or lack of it, tight budgets, the perception of the party as a fringe interest, all will play a role. For the delegates in Birmingham, the best hope lies in distinctive leftwing policies. \"When I speak to people, they understand our policies, they like them,\" says Anthony Pearce. \"It's about getting people to think, and being bold – not just accepting the status quo, but rethinking it,\" adds Anne Critchley, 72, who joined two weeks ago. \"I don't believe Ukip want people to think.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/feb/16/russian-resurgence-how-the-kremlin-is-making-its-presence-felt-across-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-16T15:38:39Z","webTitle":"Russian resurgence: how the Kremlin is making its presence felt across Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/16/russian-resurgence-how-the-kremlin-is-making-its-presence-felt-across-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/feb/16/russian-resurgence-how-the-kremlin-is-making-its-presence-felt-across-europe","fields":{"headline":"Russian resurgence: how the Kremlin is making its presence felt across Europe","bodyText":"Coming off the early shift at Hungary’s sole nuclear power station, on the Danube south of Budapest, Jozsef, a 30-year-old turbine engineer, is grateful to have a relatively secure job that pays considerably more than the national average. Hungarians have never been big fans of the Russians. But Jozsef knows whom he has to thank for his job security – Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, who is making a rare visit to an EU country with a trip to Budapest on Tuesday. Russia sealed a deal last year with Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to build reactors at the Paks power plant in return for €10bn (£7.4bn) in tied credits. Orbán has been one of Putin’s most consistent supporters within EU circles. But it is not only in Hungary that the Russians are back. All over Europe, and particularly in central and southern Europe, the Kremlin is making inroads at a time when relations between Russia and the west are at their most tense and brittle in the post-communist era. Russia is actively projecting its influences in the Balkans, particularly in Serbia and Bosnia, and has been noticeably cultivating ties with parties on the left and right further west in Europe. In Hungary, there were no tenders nor a bidding war for the nuclear project, no public debate. Hungarians first learned of the news from Russian websites. “I only know what I see on television. I don’t know how the deal was done,” Jozsef shrugs. “I did not know about it,” admits Attila Azódi, the Hungarian energy commissioner and a professor of nuclear engineering. “There were definitely reasons for that, if you look at the international situation. You have to ask the prime minister to understand the details.” The Russians already supply 80% of Hungary’s natural gas. If things go to plan at Paks, in a little more than a decade Russian technology and expertise will also be supplying 56% of Hungary’s electricity. Orbán appears entirely comfortable with that dependency. He is the leader of a country in the EU and Nato, but voices only contempt for western “liberal democracy” and holds up Putin as a leader to be admired and imitated. When John McCain, the US senator, challenged him last year on his pro-Moscow leanings, Orbán, said a source who witnessed the exchange, replied: “I don’t care what you think. You don’t matter. Russia matters because of energy. Germany matters because of jobs.” In Budapest, the Putin-Orbán bonding will be reinforced in what is only the Russian leader’s second state visit to an EU country since the Ukraine conflict broke out a year ago. The first was last year to Austria, where he was also sympathetically received by a government stridently opposed to EU sanctions on Russia. If Ukraine has turned into the battleground between east and west, Budapest often feels like the conflict’s playground. Websites and social media hum with Russian propaganda, conspiracy theories and paranoia. The neo-fascist Jobbik party, second biggest in parliament, is avowedly and loudly pro-Russia, its most senior member in the European parliament accused of being a Russian agent. “It’s surprising how open the Russian influence is,” said Péter Krekó, a Hungarian analyst at the Political Capital consultancy. “It’s not hidden. We are exposed. The Russians are making complete fools of us. Orbán has become a puppet of Putin. He thinks he can play east against west.” Moscow’s influence extends far beyond Hungary. The Putin regime is bankrolling France’s National Front on the far right. On the hard left, it has close ties to the new Greek government of Alexis Tsipras whose leftwing foreign minister has said Greece could be Russia’s “military and economic ally”. In Serbia and Bosnia, Russian politicians, military, and energy lobbies are said to be calling the shots, influencing policy, and disrupting both countries’ hopes of joining the EU. Senior European and American diplomats and officials are also convinced, without supplying hard evidence, that the Russians have infiltrated, or are helping to fund, NGOs campaigning in Europe against fracking and the proposed free trade agreement between the EU and the US, and that they have also been quietly encouraging the Scottish and Catalan secessionist movements in Britain and Spain. The talk among policymakers in European capitals struggling to counter what they see as the slick Kremlin operations aimed at dividing and enfeebling Europe is of “Putin’s useful idiots”. Through its skilled and lavishly funded television, propaganda and social media operations, the Kremlin is influencing the arguments over Ukraine, often winning over European public opinion. “It’s beyond irony,” said a senior figure in the European commission in Brussels. “You can hear Putin say he had to act in Ukraine to stop fascism, while he’s financing fascists right, left, and centre all over Europe. We’re naive in the west.” Another commission official dealing directly with Russia said: “These developments are part of an overall strategy going way beyond the conflict in Ukraine. The nationalist rhetoric has been developing in Russia for years. In helping the far right, the aim is to undermine our values and fundamentals. It’s very worrying.” In cultivating the far right and the hard left in Europe – between them they now control more than a quarter of the European parliament – Kremlin strategists are activating a policy that is at least a decade old, say Russian experts. “Links between Russian nationalists and the European far right go back to the 1990s,” said Anton Shekhovtsov, an academic who researches far-right movements, citing Russian figures such as the nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky or the neo-fascist ideologue Alexander Dugin. “The major difference is that in the 90s the cooperation was done by individuals and groups, and they did not really think the state would benefit.” The Russian state became interested in cooperation with the European far right as early as 2004, he added. Elections in Kremlin-backed breakaway states such as Abkhazia or Transnistria, in Georgia and Moldova respectively, would be observed and validated by far-right politicians from the EU. There was an ideological component to the partnership, given the increasing social conservatism of the Russian elite – homophobia, anti-immigration, opposition to the EU, anti-Americanism. Konstantin Malofeev, a wealthy Russian oligarch, Putin-backer and extreme nationalist who has said Ukraine is an artificial creation, appears to be a central figure in the funding and wooing of Russian support in Europe. He funded and attended a lavish event in a Habsburg palais in Vienna last year for leaders of the European far right, ostensibly devoted to marking 200 years since the alliance between the Russian tsar, the Austro-Hungarian emperor and the king of Prussia following Napoleon’s defeat. Malofeev has been blacklisted by the EU for his role in Ukraine – he helped finance and supply the pro-Russia insurgency, some of whose leaders were his former employees – and cannot now travel to Europe. As he could not attend a wedding in Greece thrown by an oligarch friend, he invited the entire party of 90 to his estate south of Moscow in October. The attendees included Panos Kammenos, the new Greek defence minister and leader of the nationalist Anel party – Tsipras’s junior coalition partner. Thewedding details emerged from a batch of 700 emails of a diplomat at the Russian embassy in Athens, hacked in December and revealed recently in the German weekly newspaper, Die Zeit. The emails reveal Russian diplomatic contacts with Greek and Italian neo-fascists. They also show Nikos Kotzias, the new Greek foreign minister, corresponding with Dugin, a key Putin ideologue and extreme nationalist. Kotzias started his job as foreign minister a fortnight ago, questioning the latest round of EU sanctions against Russia. Previously, as a politics professor at Piraeus University, Kotzias organised several studies and polls on Greek attitudes to Russia. He concluded that many Greeks were disenchanted with their western allies and inclined to favour Russia. “For Greeks, Russia is a potential military and economic ally whom they respect and seem to know relatively well,” he wrote, according to the hacked emails. Alexander Lebedev, the Russian businessman who owns the Evening Standard and the Independent, says it is not always clear whether wealthy Russian ideologues cultivating politicians in Europe are acting on direct Kremlin orders or just currying favour with the regime. “You can never tell whether they are trying to read the mind of their bosses in advance or whether they have been told what to do,” he said. But a €9m loan to Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France from the Russians – disclosed a couple of months ago – could only come with strings attached, said Lebedev. “What is the point of giving such a loan? The only way the party can repay the loan is by doing something politically.” A Putin ally and MP from his United Russia party delivered a speech to a congress of the National Front in Lyon in November, in which he claimed Russia better understood the European people. “The will of the people of European countries is being subsumed by the will of a few little-known officials from the EU who in reality are simply American puppets,” declared Andrei Isayev. “In Russia, we think that democracy should respect the rights of the minority, but should mainly be about the will of the majority, which is based on traditional values. I am certain that in Europe, the vast majority of people would agree.” Le Pen would agree – as may Nigel Farage, of Ukip, who has voiced his admiration for Putin. But at present Orbán matters more because he heads a strong government with an unassailable two-thirds parliamentary majority and no opposition to worry about. In the past year, he has purged around 200 diplomats from the Hungarian foreign ministry. Those remaining, say disgruntled former officials in Budapest, have been asked to detail the timings and contents of past contacts with US diplomats. “Now, like in the old days, it’s an advantage for a Hungarian diplomat to have studied in Moscow,” said Krekó. “It is clear that Russia is providing support for all these political parties all over central and eastern Europe,” said Tamás Lattmann, a law professor at Budapest’s National University of Public Service. “This is a very serious problem because when they get a certain amount of presence, if nothing else, then they can at least block, for example, the sanctions against Russia.” Alone among western leaders, Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has warned recently that in his drive to divide and weaken the EU from within, Putin is also targeting aspiring EU members in the Balkans. Twenty years after the Bosnian war ended, the Russians for the first time abstained in November on a UN vote extending the EU peacekeeping mission in Sarajevo. Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political analyst, told Radio Free Europe: “I do not mean military intervention, there are not going to be little green men in the Balkans. But in his attempt to disunite Europe, I believe that Putin can very well instrumentalise the lack of political stability and economic prosperity ... they see the Balkans as a place where they can use their power to disrupt.” As Putin goes to Budapest for what has become a rare experience – being welcomed by a friendly EU government – the turbine engineer in Paks is aware of the contradiction, but is not bothered by it. “Hungarians are prejudiced against the Russians,” said Jozsef. “But people are happy about the Russians being back here.” Additional reporting: Kim Willsher in Paris and Daniel Nolan in Budapest"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/nov/07/radical-new-economic-system-will-emerge-from-collapse-of-capitalism","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-07T17:04:29Z","webTitle":"Radical new economic system will emerge from collapse of capitalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/07/radical-new-economic-system-will-emerge-from-collapse-of-capitalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/07/radical-new-economic-system-will-emerge-from-collapse-of-capitalism","fields":{"headline":"Radical new economic system will emerge from collapse of capitalism","bodyText":"At the very moment of its ultimate triumph, capitalism will experience the most exquisite of deaths. This is the belief of political adviser and author Jeremy Rifkin, who argues the current economic system has become so successful at lowering the costs of production that it has created the very conditions for the destruction of the traditional vertically integrated corporation. Rifkin, who has advised the European Commission, the European Parliament and heads of state, including German chancellor Angela Merkel, says: No one in their wildest imagination, including economists and business people, ever imagined the possibility of a technology revolution so extreme in its productivity that it could actually reduce marginal costs to near zero, making products nearly free, abundant and absolutely no longer subject to market forces. With many manufacturing companies surviving only on razor thin margins, they will buckle under competition from small operators with virtually no fixed costs. “We are seeing the final triumph of capitalism followed by its exit off the world stage and the entrance of the collaborative commons,” Rifkin predicts. The creation of the collaborative commons From the ashes of the current economic system, he believes, will emerge a radical new model powered by the extraordinary pace of innovation in energy, communication and transport. “This is the first new economic system since the advent of capitalism and socialism in the early 19th century so it’s a remarkable historical event and it’s going to transform our way of life fundamentally over the coming years,” Rifkin says. “It already is; we just haven’t framed it.” Some sectors, such as music and media, have already been disrupted as a result of the internet’s ability to let individuals and small groups compete with the major established players. Meanwhile, the mainstreaming of 3D printing and tech advances in logistics – such as the installation of billions of intelligent sensors across supply chains – means this phenomenon is now spreading from the virtual to the physical world, Rifkin says. Climate change The creation of a new economic system, Rifkin argues, will help alleviate key sustainability challenges, such as climate change and resource scarcity, and take pressure off the natural world. That’s because it will need only a minimum amount of energy, materials, labour and capital. He says few people are aware of the scale of danger the human race is facing, particularly the growing levels of precipitation in the atmosphere, which is leading to extreme weather. “Ecosystems can’t catch up with the shift in the planet’s water cycle and we’re in the sixth extinction pattern,” he warns. “We could lose 70% of our species by the end of this century and may be imperilling our ability to survive on this planet.” Convergence of communication, energy and transport Every economy in history has relied for its success on the three pillars of communication, energy, and transportation, but what Rifkin says makes this age unique is that we are seeing them converge to create a super internet. While the radical changes in communication are already well known, he claims a revolution in transport is just around the corner. “You’ll have near zero marginal cost electricity with the probability of printed out cars within 10 or 15 years,” he says. “Add to this GPS guidance and driverless vehicles and you will see the marginal costs of transport on this automated logistics internet falling pretty sharply.” Rifkin is particularly interested in the upheaval currently rippling through the energy sector and points to the millions of small and medium sized enterprises, homeowners and neighbourhoods already producing their own green electricity. The momentum will only gather pace as the price of renewable technology plummets. Rifkin predicts the cost of harvesting energy will one day be as cheap as buying a phone: You can create your own green electricity and then go up on the emerging energy internet and programme your apps to share your surpluses across that energy internet. You can also use all the big data across that value chain to see how the energy is flowing. That’s not theoretical. It’s just starting. He says the German energy company E.ON has already recognised that the traditional centralised energy company model is going to disappear and is following his advice to move towards becoming a service provider, finding value by helping others manage their energy flows. He urges large companies across all sectors to follow suit and, rather than resist change, use their impressive scale and organisational capabilities to help aggregate emerging networks. Network neutrality: key to success While Rifkin believes the economic revolution is likely to be unstoppable, he warns that it could be distorted if individual countries and corporations succeed in their intensifying battle for control of the internet: If the old industries can monopolise the pipes, the structure, and destroy network neutrality, then you have global monopolies and Big Brother for sure. But if we are able to maintain network neutrality, it would mean that any consumer who turns prosumer, with their mobile and their apps, already can begin to feed into this expanded internet of things that’s developing. People think this is off on the horizon but if I had said in 1989, before the web came, that 25 years later we’d have democratised communication and 40% of the human race would be sending information goods of all kinds to each other, they’d have said that couldn’t happen. The paradox of over-consumption Isn’t Rifkin concerned that the ability to produce goods so cheaply will just lead to more strain on the planet’s limited resources as a growing global population go on a buying frenzy? He believes there is a paradox operating here, which is that over consumption results from our fear of scarcity, so will go away when we know we can have what we want. Millennials are already seeing through the false notion that the more we accumulate, the more we are autonomous and free. It seems they are more interested in developing networks and joining the sharing economy than in consumption for consumption’s sake. Nonprofit sector to become preeminent What about the concern that the end of capitalism would lead to chaos? Rifkin believes the gap left by the disappearance of major corporations will be filled by the nonprofit sector. For anyone who doubts this, Rifkin points to the hundreds of millions of people who are already involved in a vast network of co-operatives around the world: There’s an institution in our life that we all rely on every day that provides all sorts of goods and services that have nothing to do with profit or government entitlement and without it we couldn’t live and that’s the social commons. There’s millions of organisations that provide healthcare, education, ministering to the poor, culture, arts, sports, recreation, and it goes on and on. This isn’t considered by economists because it creates social capital which is essential to all three of the internets, but doesn’t create market capital. But as a revenue producer, it’s huge and what’s interesting is it’s growing faster than the GDP in the private market system. At the age of 69, Rifkin admits he may not live long enough to see his hope for a better future materialise, but says the collaborative commons offers the only viable way forward to deal with the sustainability challenges faced by humanity. “We’ve got a new potential platform to get us to where we need to go”, he says. “I don’t know if it’s in time, but if there’s an alternative plan I have no idea what it could be. What I do know is that staying with a vertically integrated system – based on large corporations with fossil fuels, nuclear power and centralised telecommunications, alongside growing unemployment, a narrowing of GDP and technologies that are moribund – is not the answer.” Read more like this: An economic system that supports people and planet is still possible Ebola’s catastrophic consequences on Sierra Leone’s small-scale mining sector Blueprint for Better Business gives companies a ‘get out of jail free card’ Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

He was direct and opinionated, but also caring and generous. Ron was born in Darlington, the second of four children of Ernest, a labourer, and Ethel, a domestic help, and stayed in the town all his life. As a boy, too young for library membership, he persuaded the librarian to issue him with a card anyway, and she would kindly reach books down from shelves that were too high for him. Ron gained a scholarship to attend the town's boys' grammar school, where he excelled as an all-rounder. He felt that the headteacher discriminated against boys from poorer homes, and this influenced his sociopolitical views later in life. Ron was a lifelong member of the Labour party, but cancelled his membership in 2003 after the invasion of Iraq. He was ruthlessly intelligent, well-read, and loved music and Shakespeare. In his youth, Ron was a rugby player of considerable ability – with the Grammar School Old Boys, now known as Darlington Mowden Park – and would swim in the river Tees to train. A hard tackling prop-forward who ran like a winger, he was said by many contemporaries to be worthy of an England cap. National service prevented Ron from attending university; instead he joined the Royal Signals and was later sent to fight in the Korean war. He then spent his career in engineering, eventually becoming head of research and development, a job he loved. Even then, Ron maintained good relationships with the men on the shop floor. He became a guru of non-metallic materials such as thermal insulation, paints and coatings, and was involved in the design of storage tanks and nuclear reactors up and down the land. One day a helicopter whisked him off to Manchester in an emergency, to fix a fractured gas tank. In 1953 Ron married Midge, a nurse, with whom he had two children. Midge developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease in her 40s, and the care support team marvelled at his courage and resilience during her devastating illness. In 2000 he married my mother, Barbara, whom he cherished, and raised me through my teens and into adulthood. Ron is survived by Barbara, his son, Ian, and daughter, Jill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/jan/23/obama-delhi-modi-india-us-new-era","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-23T14:22:20Z","webTitle":"Obama jets off to Delhi as US and India enter new era of goodwill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/23/obama-delhi-modi-india-us-new-era","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jan/23/obama-delhi-modi-india-us-new-era","fields":{"headline":"Obama jets off to Delhi as US and India enter new era of goodwill","bodyText":"Official relations between the world’s two largest democracies have come a long way since the new Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was once banned from entering the United States because of concerns over his human rights record. But when Barack Obama touches down in Delhi this weekend to celebrate the two countries’ burgeoning diplomatic love-in with anticipated deals on trade, climate change and defence, he is expected to acknowledge an entirely different factor driving these two giants closer together: the increasingly influential Indian American diaspora. Though less well-known than older immigrant groups, there are many prominent Indians in American society. The US surgeon general and new ambassador to Delhi; the governors of Louisiana and South Carolina; the chief executives of Microsoft and Pepsi; the deans of Harvard College and Harvard Business School and the frontrunner to become California’s next US senator are all of Indian American heritage. New Jersey lawyer Seema Singh is typical of these successful professionals encouraging her two home countries to put their many historic differences behind them, and she recalls how much has changed since she once rallied with other expats against Modi’s visa ban in 2005. “There has been a vast change in attitude; it’s like a total 360-degree turn,” says Singh. “Our community is very involved in politics; they have a lot of clout. It’s a huge vote bank for any politician who is running.” Not all of the issues that matter to Indian American expats – such as immigration reform and trade liberalisation – are on the US agenda for Sunday’s summit meeting, but the influence of the diaspora cuts both ways, according to those who travel back and forth regularly. “Almost every upper-middle-class family, and increasingly more middle-class Indian families, has a family member who is a professional in the United States,” says Sujai Shivakumar, a scientist at the National Research Council in Washington. “Given the relative ease of travel and, in the past decade, the nearly free cost of communication, these family networks have been preserved and extended. This means, among other implications, that a critical mass of educated Indians in India have been exposed to and even understand the American mindset.” “I think this [summit] very much underlines the role that the Indian diaspora has played in the kind of bilateral relationship,” agrees Waheguru Pal Singh Sidhu, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Sometimes quite to the surprise of Indians, but I think this is something which is also going to come up and resonate in the course of this particular visit.” White House officials confirm that the “soft power” relationships binding Delhi and Washington are likely to feature as much if not more than the “hard power” negotiations over arms sales, nuclear energy and regional security that tend to capture most media attention. “The president will speak to the fact that we’ve often noted this potential for the US-India relationship – two very large economies, the two largest democracies in the world, a large India diaspora that has thrived here in the United States,” says Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security advisor. “People have long looked at this relationship and seen the fundamentals in place for a really, really close partnership, and yet it’s been a challenge in translating that into outcomes.” Exactly what deals are likely to be announced during the visit was still unclear just days before the president was due to arrive, but most observers expect tangible benefits from the growing diplomatic warmth. “It’s typically Indian to negotiate to the last minute, but there has to be some forward movement, even something small. A president doesn’t come all this way for nothing, after all,” says professor Raja C Mohan, a respected Delhi-based analyst. Climate change is a major area of discussion with one possibility lying in an agreement for a multibillion-dollar fund to invest in Indian solar and wind power with potentially significant involvement of US businesses. Other deals may include an agreement on exchange of information of security threats – particularly terrorism, movement on a stalled civil nuclear power deal and a package that would ease currently onerous procedures for visas. For India however, the visit is mainly about something more intangible: a sense that the US respects India as a partner. Obama is the first US president to visit twice while in power, and this will also be the first time a US president has been present at the Republic Day parade,which celebrates the introduction in 1950 of the country’s own constitution and thus its full independence from Britain. The parade, with its fly-past, tanks, camels and dancing schoolchildren, is a key national ritual celebrating Indian military might and, to a lesser extent, cultural richness. “The parade began as an anti-colonial gesture, and evolved organically. In the public perception it is seen as a military parade and that sends signals. But it is a very popular event, a carnival, and fun,” said Neelam Deo, director of the Gateway House thinktank in Mumbai and a former diplomat. Officials have claimed the idea of the invitation was the prime minister’s. Much of the media attention in India this week has focused on security arrangements in Delhi. Several square miles of the centre of the city will be closed to normal traffic and tens of thousands of police and paramilitaries will be deployed. The president and first lady are also expected to travel to Agra to see the Taj Mahal, a journey of around 200km, which can take four or five hours by car or train. The party will go by helicopter. The mausoleum will be closed for the visit and an exclusion zone established around it. On his previous visit, in November 2010, Obama won over politicians with a pledge to the national assembly to back India’s long-standing bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council, and pleased businessmen with the announcement of $14bn worth of deals. Michelle Obama danced, sang and played hopscotch with disadvantaged and disabled children in Mumbai, astonishing and charming a country used to celebrities and leaders obsessed with protocol and status. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal before his trip to New York and Washington, Modi described the US as India’s “natural partner”. This is an optimistic portrayal of a relationship which, though it has improved steadily since the end of the cold war, has often been rocky. In 1998, the US placed India under sanctions following a nuclear test. Modi’s own visa problems stemmed from 1998 US law barring entry to foreigners who have committed “particularly severe violations of religious freedom”. The decision followed accusations that the former tea-seller and rightwing organiser had stood by during, or even encouraged, sectarian violence in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed by rioters. Modi has denied all wrongdoing and India’s supreme court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to back the charges against him. The UK ended its boycott of Modi in 2012. The EU swiftly followed, but the US ambassador only met the then prime ministerial candidate for the first time months before his landslide election win. Modi inherited a fraught bilateral relationship that had been damaged when the Indian deputy consul-general in the US was arrested for visa fraud in New York, strip-searched and held in police custody in December 2013. The affair prompted a vitriolic reaction in India to what was seen as disrespectful bullying. This in turn prompted US commentators to accuse India of oversensitivity and behaviour unbecoming of an aspirant future power. Modi won the first outright majority in Indian politics for 30 years in May 2014 after pledging to boost flagging growth in the emerging power where red tape, corruption, poor infrastructure and restrictive laws remain major challenges to business. The 64-year-old from humble origins moved swiftly to repair the damage and accepted an invitation from Obama to visit the US. The trip, in September, received massive and positive coverage in India and was seen as a turning point. Modi focused much of his speech at a sold-out $1.5m event at Madison Square Garden in New York on the economic potential of India, his desire to reform government and to improve sanitation. The former rightwing organiser appealed directly for the diaspora to help him clean the Ganges, the heavily polluted river sacred to Hindus. Modi received rapturous applause for saying that when people asked him for a “big vision” he replied that he was only a “small man” who started out selling tea. Indian media highlighted the presence of more than 40 US congressmen who were present to watch the speech, saying it was evidence of India’s emergence as a “great power”. “Aspirational India, modern India has certainly admired the economic and technological achievements of the US. Their’s is a higher comfort level with the US. This is the government catching up with the people in a sense,” said Deo, the analyst. But both India and the US, beyond the economic advantages of closer ties, have mutual geopolitical interests too. India is nervous about Chinese efforts to build influence in the region, particularly in Sri Lanka, though concerns there have been allayed by the defeat of president Mahinda Rajapaksa in the recent election. Washington made no secret of its distaste for Rajapaksa who had swung the island state towards Beijing. Both India and the US are concerned about China’s ties with Pakistan. When Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, made his first trip to India last year his announcement of $20bn of investment was seen as a disappointment and was overshadowed by renewed tensions over the contested Himalayan border between the two emerging Asian powers. There has also been significant tension over past six months between Pakistan and India with long periods of shelling and casualties on both side. India will want the US to toughen its policy towards its hostile neighbour which it blames for much terrorism locally. Delhi will also be pushing for a greater US commitment to Afghanistan as US troops there pull out, fearful of anarchy in the war-torn south Asian state allowing anti-Indian extremists, some based in Pakistan, to destabilise the region. This will not lead to any friction however, said Gopalapuram Parthasarathy, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan and analyst. “We are in touch and we know each others requirements and limitations,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/dec/02/government-told-come-clean-energy-subsidies-fuel-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-02T00:02:02Z","webTitle":"Government told to come clean on energy subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/02/government-told-come-clean-energy-subsidies-fuel-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/dec/02/government-told-come-clean-energy-subsidies-fuel-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Government told to come clean on energy subsidies","bodyText":"The government has been urged to be more honest about the levels of subsidies given to oil and gas producers and the companies who will build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. A parliamentary watchdog argued on Monday that ministers should admit they are already providing £12bn of annual subsidies to fossil fuel operations and windfarms while lining up more support for shale gas and nuclear. The environmental audit committee (EAC) said subsidies to oil and other carbon fuels should be scaled back because of the impact on global warming, and also urged ministers to restate a previous commitment to ending fuel poverty. A report on energy subsidies just published by the committee says the chancellor's autumn statement later this week is an ideal chance to provide a \"clear and comprehensive analysis of energy subsidies in the UK\". The report says such a move would bring much needed transparency and provide a basis for an overdue debate on the rationale and justifications for providing public money to support the energy sector. \"At the Rio+20 [climate change] summit and the G20, the government committed itself to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,\" said MP Joan Walley, chair of the EAC. \"The government must set a target to reduce subsidies to harmful fossil fuels.\" The lower rate of VAT on domestic and business fuel bills – 5% as opposed to the standard 20% – is also effectively a hidden subsidy, as are field allowances for North Sea oil and gas despite government claims to the contrary, said the EAC. The committee also believes the public commitment to capacity payments to encourage energy companies to build new gas-fired power stations are a subsidy. But its biggest criticism is over ministers' insistence that the deal agreed by the Treasury and EDF to fund the construction of a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is not a subsidy. \"New nuclear is being subsidised and the coalition should come clean and admit it,\" said Walley. \"The government cannot escape that clear fact by talking about 'support mechanisms' and 'insurance policies' instead of 'subsidies'.\" The EAC report was informed by a detailed paper on energy subsidies in the UK commissioned by the committee from William Blyth of Oxford Energy Associates, an independent consultancy. Last week Lord Browne, the former BP chief executive and a government adviser, called the Hinkley deal \"very, very expensive\". He said giving more state subsidies to oil and gas than to renewable energy was \"like running both the heating and the air conditioning at the same time\". The EAC is also wary about government moves to switch the ECO energy efficiency scheme from household bills to general taxation and particularly its switch in method for counting those in fuel poverty. Walley said: \"The government is shifting the goalposts on fuel poverty so that official statistics record far fewer households as fuel-poor. The changes to the fuel poverty definition and target, in part being made through amendments to the energy bill, should be stopped unless the government is prepared to make a public commitment to end fuel poverty altogether.\" She added: \"A short-term bid to cut bills must not throw energy and climate change policy off course. \"In the longer term green levies could actually keep bills down if they drive energy efficiency improvements that cut the cost of heating our homes. \"Insulating homes and supporting green technologies is vital to help the fuel-poor and cut the emissions causing climate change.\" Friends of the Earth agreed with the committee's findings. \"MPs are spot on. The only way to tackle the scandal of fuel poverty and rocketing energy bills is through a well-funded programme of insulation and not handouts for oil barons and fracking firms, under a veil of green-bashing,\" said David Powell, FoE's economics campaigner. \"It's astonishing that the chancellor is preparing to slash funding to insulate the homes of the poorest in society, while throwing billions of pounds of tax breaks at oil and gas firms to keep the nation hooked on increasingly costly fossil fuels. \"There are good subsidies, and extremely bad ones – government funding should be targeted at energy efficiency and renewables and building a low-carbon power system we can all afford.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/31/ministers-misled-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-31T17:35:42Z","webTitle":"Ministers 'misled MPs over need for nuclear power stations'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/31/ministers-misled-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/31/ministers-misled-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Ministers 'misled MPs over need for nuclear power stations'","bodyText":"Ministers misled parliament over the need to build a new fleet of nuclear power stations, distorting evidence and presenting to MPs a false summary of the analysis they had commissioned, a group of MPs and experts alleged in a report published on Tuesday. If MPs had been presented with an accurate picture of the evidence for and against new reactors, the government's plans might have been challenged, according to the report. Both the previous Labour government and the current coalition overstated the evidence that new nuclear power was needed, it also alleged. Building new nuclear power stations is highly controversial, as polls consistently show a substantial minority opposing them. But many people, including some environmental campaigners, have been persuaded towards supporting nuclear by the argument that they would help the UK generate power without carbon dioxide emissions. The previous government cited its own research in order to make that case, but according to today's report, some of the findings were misrepresented when relayed to MPs by ministers. For instance, the report found that rather than assess the requirement for new nuclear power stations and then work out how many would be needed, the government commissioned research that took as its central assumption that 10 new reactors would be built and then presented its research as evidence of the need for 10 reactors. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said: \"We are confident that the Energy National Policy Statements [which set out the government's arguments that new nuclear power was needed] are robust documents which took account of all relevant factors.\" The report suggested that the current government's repeated assertion that electricity demand was likely to double was based on taking some of the highest estimates from its research rather than the average. The author, Ron Bailey, who has written against nuclear power, also accused ministers of ignoring key findings of the research they had commissioned that showed ways in which the UK could do without new nuclear power. A spokesman for the DECC said: \"We need a range of new energy infrastructure to keep the lights on and reduce our carbon emissions in a secure and affordable way. The UK has everything to gain from becoming a leading destination to invest in new nuclear power. This will come alongside investment in other technologies such as renewables, clean coal and gas, and improved energy efficiency.\" The report, called A Corruption of Governance?, was written by pressure group Unlock Democracy and the Association for the Conservation of Energy, and was endorsed by a cross-party group of MPs. The organisations called for the debate on new nuclear power to be reopened in parliament. Caroline Lucas, the UK's only Green Party MP, said: \"Despite claiming that it wants an open debate on the UK's energy future, the government has already made it clear in the proposals for electricity market reform and in its dismissive response to the Fukushima disaster that it is betting its money on nuclear. Given what we know about the strength of nuclear industry lobbying, there needs to be far greater transparency around the decisions that will determine where our electricity comes from in ten or 20 years time.\" She added: \"With other countries turning away from nuclear power, MPs and the public must be told the truth about how we can achieve energy security and a genuinely green economy.\" However, despite the report's findings, many experts support nuclear power on the grounds that other low-carbon alternatives cannot supply enough power, particularly when electric cars replace petrol-driven models and more electricity is used for heating to replace gas and oil, driving up electricity demand. For instance, Prof David Mackay, now chief scientific advisor to DECC, has made the case that not enough on and offshore wind farms, biomass power plants and other low-carbon forms of electricity can be built in the UK to satisfy demand, so investments in nuclear power will be needed. Peter Facey, the director of Unlock Democracy, said his organisation did not have a position on nuclear energy, but wanted to \"ensure that the information on which ministers based their decisions is as impartial and robust as possible\". In the case of the arguments used for nuclear power, he said: \"The data appears to have been politicised. It is crucial that meetings between government officials and the nuclear lobby are opened up to greater scrutiny so we can have greater confidence that policy makers are not being misled.\" The MPs endorsing the report included Alan Whitehead (Lab), Tessa Munt (LibDem), Mike Weatherley (Con), Martin Horwood (LibDem), Joan Walley (Lab) and Caroline Lucas (Green)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/01/russia-foreign-minister-immediate-ceasefire-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-01T09:23:00Z","webTitle":"Russian foreign minister calls for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/russia-foreign-minister-immediate-ceasefire-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/01/russia-foreign-minister-immediate-ceasefire-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russian foreign minister calls for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine","bodyText":"Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said negotiations taking place in Minsk to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine should seek an immediate ceasefire. Lavrov added that Ukrainian forces must pull back from positions from which they can hit civilians. \"They must leave positions from which they can harm the civilian population,\" Lavrov told students in Moscow on Monday. \"I very much count on today's negotiations being devoted above all to the task of agreeing an immediate ceasefire, without conditions.\" The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, accused Moscow of \"direct and open\" aggression against his country, as forces battled a Russian tank battalion for a vital airport in Luhansk on Monday, and in Ilovaysk, near the east's main city of Donetsk, several hundred Ukrainian forces remained trapped within an encirclement by Russia-backed separatists. In Mariupol, two Ukrainian seamen were reported missing after an attack by separatist rebel artillery on a patrol boat in the Asov Sea. Eight seamen had been rescued, a Ukrainian border guard official said on Monday. The talks in the Belarusian capital will bring together representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) security forum and separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has called on Kiev to enter discussions on \"statehood\" for the south-east regions of Ukraine a day after the EU gave Russia a week to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine or face further sanctions. In excerpts of an interview with state television broadcast on Sunday evening, the Russian president said talks between Ukrainian authorities and separatist leaders in the east should begin immediately and be about \"not just technical issues but on the political organisation of society and statehood in south-eastern Ukraine\". His spokesperson later said Putin had not meant the region should gain independence, but that dialogue should begin. Western leaders have accused Russia of fanning the flames of the insurgency in east Ukraine, and in recent weeks of providing direct military assistance, as the armed rebels suffered a number of losses to the Ukrainian army and appeared on the brink of defeat. The EU said late on Saturday that if Russia did not reverse course in Ukraine within a week, a further round of sanctions would be imposed, but there is disagreement within the 28-member block about the effectiveness of sanctions and a fear that more serious measures would also harm European economies. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the sanctions would build on existing measures against Russia. Senior diplomats confirmed the punitive measures were not so much new as a tightening of the restrictions imposed in July on Russian financial, energy and defence sectors. \"It's about closing loopholes,\" said a diplomat. They warned, however, that it could be weeks before any new sanctions were applied, perhaps as late as October. The Senate foreign relations committee chair and Obama administration loyalist, Robert Menendez, called for the US to arm the Ukrainian military. Speaking in Kiev, he said: \"This is a watershed moment. Thousands of Russian troops are here and are directly engaged in what is clearly an invasion. We should be providing the Ukrainians with the types of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon Putin for further aggression.\" Kiev has said it will not negotiate with the leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, which it lists as terrorists. But in an apparent victory for Moscow, the separatists said they would be taking part in talks in Minsk this week with a delegation from Kiev. Analysts have speculated that Putin does not want a Crimea-style annexation, which would be expensive and militarily difficult, but instead wants to create a \"frozen conflict\" that would give Moscow permanent leverage in Ukraine. Since talks between Putin and Poroshenko in Minsk last Tuesday, the situation on the ground has changed, with rebel forces taking control of Novoazovsk in the far south-east of the country, which they are believed to have taken with help from Russian army soldiers and equipment. But the promised assault on the key port city of Mariupol has not materialised. Many residents have been digging trenches on the outskirts of the city and preparing to defend it. Mariupol was under rebel control at the beginning of the uprising but was taken back by Kiev's forces in June and most of its residents have little appetite for further violence, although many remain sceptical about the Ukrainian government. Kiev has said it will defend Mariupol from any rebel assault, though there is little sign of serious reinforcements with which to repel any attack. The majority of the forces appear to be from volunteer battalions. Vadim, a commander in the Azov battalion, known for its far-right leanings, said on Sunday that it was imperative to defend the city because of its strategic importance. \"If we lose Mariupol we will lose the war,\" said the 34-year-old, as he headed to a factory to transport concrete blocks to reinforce checkpoints. Ukrainian forces said two coastguard vessels came under fire off the coast of Mariupol. Videos from the scene showed a plume of smoke rising from an object several miles offshore. It was unclear how the boats were attacked. People in the vicinity said they heard loud explosions but did not see or hear any aircraft, suggesting they may have been hit by missiles fired from land. Russia has denied all accusations that its soldiers are active in eastern Ukraine, stating that a group of paratroopers captured inside the country had got lost and crossed \"by accident\", and all other Russians fighting in the region were volunteers or serving soldiers \"on holiday\". The paratroopers were handed back to Russia over the weekend after what a Russian general, Alexei Ragozin, described as \"very difficult\" negotiations. He said it was unacceptable that the Ukrainians had detained the men, and noted that Russia had returned Ukrainian soldiers who had strayed over the border previously. The Ukrainian soldiers generally crossed the border to escape fighting, whereas Kiev accuses the Russians of coming to Ukraine to wage war. The latest such group, comprising 63 fighters, was sent back to Ukraine in exchange for the captured paratroopers. In interviews, the Russian paratroopers claimed they had not realised they were inside Ukraine until they came under fire. The claims that they crossed the border accidentally have been mocked by Kiev, and during the capture of Novoazovsk earlier in the week there were numerous sightings of \"green men\" – well-equipped soldiers wearing no insignia but immediately distinguishable from the irregular rebels. Nato said it believed at least 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating inside Ukraine. Putin, however, has insisted that the conflict is an \"internal Ukrainian\" matter. His rhetoric in recent days has been bullish, comparing the Ukrainian army offensive in the east to the Nazi siege of Leningrad and reminding the west that Russia is a nuclear power and \"it's better not to mess with us\".

At no time during our journey – part of which was made in a clean, comfortable, Chinese-made train – did we feel anything but safe. Our only exposure to violence was in the provincial town of Zanjan, famous for its knife production, where a salesman dry-shaved his own forearm in demonstration of his wares. No one in their right mind would undertake a comparable journey nowadays inside the borders of any of Iran’s war-torn neighbours: Iraq, Afghanistan, or, a bit further afield, Syria. Iran is the exception along the Middle East’s strategic, resource-rich central belt, a functioning nation state where the central authorities enjoy a monopoly of force, the infrastructure works and the people are overwhelmingly literate and unarmed. Perhaps most significant of all, as capo di tutti capi of the Shia world – wielding clout over its co-religionists in Iraq and Lebanon as well as propping up Bashar al-Assad with military assistance and subsidised oil – Iran could have a vital role in restoring stability throughout Mesopotamia and the Levant. I say “could” because there is no guarantee that the Iranians will be invited to assume the role that common sense assigns them. It’s one of the perversities of modern politics that the west does not have a decent working relationship with the most important country in the Middle East. Negotiations to that end have been going on for the past year between Iran and the so-called P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations security council plus Germany), and last week at the UN general assembly David Cameron met the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani – the first such meeting since the 1979 revolution. Improved atmospherics, however, cannot hide the fact that the only substantive achievements of the diplomatic process so far – a freeze on key parts of Iran’s nuclear development in exchange for a freeze on further sanctions – are reversible. And now is crunch time; for 24 November, the final day of negotiations, is just eight weeks away, and big differences remain over the scope of the uranium enrichment programme that Iran will be allowed to retain. At the same time the incomplete alliance that the US has built against the militants of Islamic State (Isis) – including Sunni monarchies such as Saudi Arabia, which have a history of fanning Shia-phobia (and anti-infidel hatred more generally), while keeping Iran at arm’s length – illustrates once again the illogic of the western approach. It was almost impossible to argue in favour of a detente with Iran during the dreadful government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who presided over a galloping nuclear programme and an ailing economy even as he advocated Israel’s elimination. But in August 2013 he was replaced by Rouhani, a partly British-educated cleric whose election message of balance in all things chimed with reformist voters as well as the conservative supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The new president has since scored notable successes – while keeping Khamenei on side, despite the latter’s scepticism over nuclear talks. Rouhani has used the momentum generated by the interim deal – in addition to the modest sanctions relief that accompanied it – to cut inflation from 45% to 20% and stabilise the rial currency after it lost more than 80% of its value. Human rights in Iran remain wretched – as exemplified by the continued incarceration of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman who was arrested this summer after trying to enter an all-male sports arena, and is now charged with “propagandising against the regime”. But abuses of this kind are not Rouhani’s doing (he does not control the conservative judiciary), and many Iranians agree that, for the moment, the president’s priorities should be economic and diplomatic. With his moderation, his promotion of technocrats over ideologues – the Iranian cabinet boasts more US-educated PhDs than the American one, foreign visitors have been heard to joke – and his apparent imperviousness to conservative darts, Rouhani has the look of a survivor. He might well achieve his aim of turning Iran into a more open society and unleashing its economic potential – think of Turkey in the early 2000s, only with an abundance of oil and gas. An Iran that was integrating would conform more often to international norms, and would eagerly supply natural gas to Europe as the Russian flow dwindles. Whatever happens, Syria is an apple of discord, but there is the shared imperative of combating Isis – whose primary foe is not the west but the Shias, whom it derides indiscriminately as “Safavids”, after the 16th-century dynasty that turned Iran into a Shia state. Against the many hundreds of Shias who have been butchered by Isis, the number of westerners who have lost their lives at its hands is tiny. So it was disconcerting to hear Israel’s President Binyamin Netanyahu, in his speech to the UN this week, dismiss Rouhani’s earlier denunciation of Isis terrorism as “crocodile tears”. Netanyahu also warned against his “manipulative charm offensive”, designed to “remove the obstacles to Iran’s path to the bomb”. This caricature may have some basis in Netanyahu’s fear that a rehabilitated Islamic Republic could dislodge Israel from western affections – a process already well advanced by the widespread killing of Palestinian civilians during the recent violence in Gaza. The US and its allies have not enjoyed much recent success in influencing internal Iranian politics, but they should be aware that Rouhani’s continued political prosperity, and that of the more hopeful Iran he represents, is dependent in large measure on success in the current negotiations. If they succeed and sanctions begin to be lifted, the country could advance rapidly as oil sales rebound to 2.2m barrels a day (up from 1.3m), and the country gains access to an estimated $100bn in frozen assets abroad. Failure could bring an equally quick unravelling, however, with the US Congress imposing new sanctions after November’s midterm elections, and an inevitable Iranian response. Amid renewed uncertainty the economy would again dive, discrediting Rouhani and all he stands for. And that would be a disaster – for Iran, for the region, and ultimately for the west. Whatever the ingenious face-saving formulas proposed by the policy wonks over the next few weeks, it is the political will of Barack Obama on the one hand, and Khamenei and Rouhani on the other, that will decide the fate of the negotiations. Only in circumstances of the direst national peril would Iran make the suicidal lunge for a bomb, and it is up to both sides to ensure that such a peril never arises. A deal that offers Iran a nuclear power industry not exceeding its needs and ambitions, and the rest of the world reassurance through intrusive inspections, would do more than bring Iran in from the cold. It would inaugurate a new relationship between the Islamic Republic and the west that could keep together a region that is, in every other particular, coming apart."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/aug/15/trident-absurd-scotland-alex-salmond","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-15T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"The case for Trident is absurd.

Scotland may help us get rid of it","bodyText":"I just cannot get enough of the Scottish referendum debate. On every side the unthinkable is thought, the unsayable said. The murky covers are removed from North Sea oil, the single currency, the Barnett formula, welfare dependency, the West Lothian question, revealing swamps of intellectual confusion our rulers would rather keep hidden. None is murkier that the fate of Faslane and its Trident submarine base. No matter that most defence chiefs have long wished Trident to vanish in a puff of smoke. None has the guts to say so. The Treasury pays up so no one rocks the gilded boat. Faslane and its missiles will cost British taxpayers £100bn over the next 25 years, and for what? Britain could invade a dozen countries and seize their terrorists for less. Alex Salmond has promised that, if his people vote for independence next month, all nuclear weapons will be off Scottish soil by 2020. The result has been an outbreak of panic among the normally somnolent dogs of war. Where will the submarines and their warheads go if not in Scotland? The wild, unpopulated Scottish lochs are not easy to replicate in England or Wales. A BBC programme on the topic by Andrew Neil on Tuesday revealed a cast of gloom-laden defence pundits bewailing Britain’s “loss of influence” if Scotland were “lost” and Faslane closed. The UK would be humiliated, downgraded, demoted to the second division. Our seat at the top table would be removed. Hardly anyone mentioned defence, just prestige. The language was that of faded imperialists out of their time. The world in which these people move is not one of soldiers, guns and bombs but of thinktanks, travel grants and seminars. The only power they know is PowerPoint. A report this week from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) is more relaxed. It points out that the ailing nuclear submarine base at Plymouth’s Devonport could do perfectly well as an alternative to Faslane. The removal cost would be a mere £3.5bn. The warheads could be stored in the Fal river fjords off Carrick Roads. If you want to dump nonsense somewhere there is always somewhere to dump it. The chief objection to Plymouth is the near certainty of it playing host to a permanent camp of west country CND. Nor have we yet heard from the Cornish nationalists lurking just across the harbour. An intriguing insight into the politics of nuclear weapons is Rusi’s tangential dismissal of concerns over an “accidental ignition of one or all of a submarine’s Trident D5 missiles” and the resulting contamination of 260,000 Devonians. The ignition of the warheads would also make a dreadful mess of Truro. Apparently, the defence ministry has the right to “waive safety requirements” where it is “in the interests of urgent national security”. The same would apply to any embarrassing opposition to planning permission from local communities. Security can always be waived in the interest of security. That is not all. The truth is that when you open this can, any number of worms will wriggle out. The Rusi report raises other nuclear options. It discusses basing Britain’s deterrent where it surely belongs, in the US (birthplace of its missiles). There would be plenty of time to move it back in case of heightened international tension. The argument against is that the weapons might not be immediately available were Britain to want to use them in defiance of America’s wishes. The concept of an “independent” nuclear weapon deterring any conceivable foe is strange enough without drifting into the realm of fantasy. This beats even the Yes, Minister satire, that Britain’s deterrent was always needed to fend off the dastardly French. Or might the defence boffins really be war-gaming a British attack on the US? If so, why are we told that the Americans retain the secret warhead codes specifically to forestall any independent British use, accidental or otherwise? The most sensible note in the Rusi report is the final one. It ponders whether the possibility of having to move from Faslane might trigger “a wider national discussion … on whether or not the strategic benefits of retaining nuclear weapons exceeded the costs involved”. The question is not whether Vladimir Putin, al-Qaida or Boko Haram are remotely likely to launch an attack on the British mainland and yet be susceptible to a Trident deterrent. The question is whether, in the spectrum of existential threats to the British state, nuclear deterrence has any credibility in preference to other forms of defence, especially forms able to make similar claims to such huge resources. Ordinary soldiers come to mind. No sensible defence expert I have ever encountered has any time for Trident. Its sole supporters are those with money in the project. A more general question follows from this and applies to all multibillion-pound projects whose sanity moves in inverse proportion to their price tag. They include HS2, nuclear power stations, Heathrow runways, aircraft carriers, garden cities and universal credits. As soon as each megaproject is announced in Whitehall, a rabble of salivating bankers and lobbyists (many of them paid parliamentarians) forms a chorus to shout down any sceptic as variously killjoy or unpatriotic. The real victim is always the taxpayer. John Maynard Keynes advocated boosting public spending by burying pots of gold in the ground and paying the unemployed to dig them up. George Osborne makes Keynes seem stingy and unimaginative. Not long ago, the Treasury was the one government institution prepared to call the bluff of such megaprojects and hold them to account. It showed lobbyists the door. It was the intellectual powerhouse of the public sector. Not today. Osborne may be ruthless towards current government spending. He can guard a candle-end. But the sight of a truly daft megaproject has him rolling on his back with his feet in the air, cash oozing from every pore. Trident is just such a project. If the Scottish referendum does indeed force the absurdity of Britain’s nuclear deterrent out into the light of day, it is worth it for that alone. If it were to go further and kill Trident stone dead, it would be thank you, Salmond, thank you, Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/19/areva-wind-turbine-factory-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-19T11:56:36Z","webTitle":"Areva to open wind turbine factory in Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/19/areva-wind-turbine-factory-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/19/areva-wind-turbine-factory-scotland","fields":{"headline":"Areva to open wind turbine factory in Scotland","bodyText":"One of Europe's largest wind power engineering firms has promised to open a turbine manufacturing base in Scotland in readiness for a major expansion in North Sea windfarms. French nuclear and renewables group Areva has signed an outline agreement with the investment agency Scottish Enterprise to site one of three new factories it is opening across Europe in eastern Scotland. The deal, unveiled during a visit to Paris by the first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, is predicted to create up to 750 engineering jobs at the new site and further jobs in the wider supply chain. It was seen as a coup for Scotland, whose political leaders have spoken out strongly in favour of wind, even while English politicians have been at war on the issue. The deal comes just ahead of the planned announcement of the coalition's energy bill, expected to come later this week, and follows months of wrangling over the future of wind farms in the UK at the highest levels of government. The energy minister, John Hayes, appointed in September by David Cameron to \"deliver a win for our people\", has caused several furores by his outspoken hostility to wind farms, and the chancellor has questioned future subsidies for renewables and backed the building of at least 20 gas-fired power plants instead. These rows have helped to delay the energy bill, upon which tens of billions of pounds' worth of potential future wind manufacturing plants depends, and have unsettled investors. Some potential investors are holding back their decisions on building new infrastructure in England pending further clarity from the government on its plans. The Scottish factory will supply future Areva contracts around the UK to build turbines and blades for its powerful new 5MW turbines, specially designed for offshore windfarms. The Scottish government said Areva, which is also building factories in France and Germany, is looking closely at the future locations of offshore windfarms and the best supply bases before choosing a site for the new plant. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Salmond said this was the fourth significant wind energy investment by global energy firms in Scotland, following previous deals with Gamesa, Mitsubishi and Samsung to build factories and research centres. \"It opens the door to 750 jobs in Scotland which is obviously a huge step forward and that agreement is a big step forward in the development of Scottish renewables,\" he said. \"We've a strong hand of manufacturers seeing the opportunities that Scotland provides; it's a great step forward.\" Luc Oursel, Areva's chief executive, said in a statement: \"Areva's industrial heritage and diverse portfolio has placed us firmly at the forefront of low-carbon technology. \"Scotland is known to be a pioneer in renewables and its commitment to offshore wind in particular was a key part of our decision to locate our future UK manufacturing base there.\" Salmond has unveiled ambitious plans to meet 100% of Scotland's domestic electricity needs from renewables by 2020. Green electricity output in Scotland is currently ahead of Salmond's interim targets, but financial and renewables executives are privately doubtful that the 2020 target can be met, because of significant problems with supply chain and infrastructure, and worries about future subsidies. Maria McCaffery, chief executive of the industry body RenewableUK, said this announcement was \"tangible proof\" that renewables were very important to the UK's industrial base, as the UK government prepared to set out its future funding and infrastructure policies in a new energy bill. \"It's now time for the UK government to nail its colours to the mast and make sure these planned investments come to fruition. We need to put the recent political spats over energy policy behind us and focus on what we need most – jobs, investment and securing a way of generating clean energy on an unprecedented scale,\" she said. The prime minister and Ed Davey, the UK energy secretary, also welcomed the decision. Without mentioning the imminent energy bill, they insisted the UK government was heavily committed to renewables, both as an energy resource and for their value to manufacturing. Both men also insisted that the Areva announcement was further evidence of the value of Scotland remaining within the UK. Thanks in part to the UK green investment bank in Edinburgh, it meant different parts of the UK were able to \"harness our combined strengths\" and enjoy \"the economic security\" to become a world leader in renewables. Cameron said: \"I warmly welcome Areva's announcement today, which is brilliant news for Scotland. I am determined that Britain competes and thrives in the global race and this shows that the UK remains an attractive place for foreign investment.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
