I've been racking my brains. And here are the 10 things I've learnt at the Lib Dem conference. 1. Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems are definitely not \"going wobbly\" on the coalition. They're in it for good. After their brutal drubbing in the local elections, you might expect them to have second thoughts. But they're not. Tim Farron has made it clear that the reference in his speech to the coalition coming to an end after three or four years was not intended to mean that the coalition could collapse, and Lib Dems at all levels of the party are saying – in public and in private – that they are signed up with David Cameron until May 2015. 2. Morale is actually rather good – for reasons that are not particularly obvious. The normal assumption in British politics is that there's a direct correlation between the morale of a party and its standing in the opinion polls. After this conference, that assumption is going to have to go. They're actually quite chipper in Birmingham. Some Lib Dems are saying that that's because they're now doing better in the polls. For example, Farron said in his speech that the poll ratings had \"shot up from absolutely diabolical to just slightly depressing\". If they really believe this, they're deluded. As you can see from the figures on the YouGov tracker, or the chart showing all this year's polling numbers on the UK Polling Report website, the Lib Dems have essentially been stuck on very low single figures all year. Perhaps mass insanity explains the positive atmosphere. But I think there are other reasons. Which takes us on to … 3. The Lib Dems are now confident that they exercise real influence within the coalition. At their conference last year the Lib Dems said they were having an impact on coalition decisions, but I'm not sure that they really believed it. Now, after the rewriting of the health bill, they definitely do. The Tory MP Nadine Dorries has helped to convince them too. There have been numerous references to her question at PMQs earlier this month about how Nick Clegg was too powerful. It's hard to think of anyone else who has done so much to thrill the Lib Dems with just two sentences. 4. The Lib Dems are showing that being in coalition doesn't necessarily stop a party asserting its independence. After the coalition was formed there were anguished debates about whether the Lib Dems (or the Conservatives) could advocate their own, distinct policies without undermining the coalition. Not any more. As John Harris explained this week, the Lib Dems still use their conference for proper, hard-edged policy-making and this week they have been voting for a number of non-coalition policies covering issues such as welfare, education, drugs and nuclear power. We don't know yet how prominent any of these measures will be in the Lib Dem manifesto. But now they can easily make the case that they're different. 5. There is no threat to Clegg's leadership. Any other party that had seen its poll ratings halve over 16 months would be awash with people plotting to get rid of the leader. But that has not been happening in Birmingham. If Clegg wants to fight the next election, it seems no one is going to stop him. 6. But the thought of standing down before 2015 does seem to have crossed Clegg's mind. Clegg has issued a very firm denial of the Daily Mail story suggesting that he had promised his wife, Miriam, that he would only serve one term. Yet we haven't just had a straightforward denial. We've also had a wild attack on the Mail, some odd comments about not being able to predict the future, a refusal to say what he has told his wife about the matter and an over-the-top assertion that the Mail story is \"2,000% not true\". All of this suggests to me that there is – or was – something in all this, and whether or not to stand down in 2015 has been a subject of discussion in the Clegg household. 7. If Clegg really does want to get rid of the Lib Dems' \"fluffy bunny\" tendency, he still hasn't entirely succeeded. The \"Clegg standing down\" suggestion came from a new biography of the Lib Dem leader by the journalist Jasper Gerard which argues that Clegg is trying to turn the Lib Dems from a \"fluffy bunny\" party for people who like permanent opposition into a centrist party of government. Broadly, this is what is happening. But the Lib Dems haven't become completely conventional and this week they voted for a review that could lead to a partial decriminalisation of drugs, called for a ban on page 3 girls, spent an hour debating the rules on blood donation for men who have sex with men, and proposed the establishment of a happiness quango. There's still a streak of non-conformist wackiness in this party that makes it unique. 8. The Lib Dems aren't getting any closer to Labour. The Lib Dems might feel less warm about the Conservatives than they did last year, but there is no evidence that this is making them any more pro-Labour. They haven't got anything particularly nice to say about Ed Miliband, and it is hard to imagine any ministers who have signed up to George Osborne's economic strategy ever working in harmony with Miliband and Ed Balls. That said, there is some obvious potential for policy overlap. If Miliband were to wholeheartedly back the Lib Dem mansion tax idea at Labour's conference next, the dynamics of British politics could start to look different. 9. If there's another hung parliament, what the Lib Dems do will be determined by the numbers, and not by ideology. Given that there seems to be a good chance that there will be another hung parliament, journalists have spent the week trying to work out whether the Lib Dems would prefer a coalition with Labour or another term with the Tories. But I'm starting to think that that's a waste of time. Whenever you ask ministers and MPs about this, they keep coming back to the point that it will depend on the election results and the number of seats each party has in the House of Commons. As far as I can tell, personal and ideological preference will only count for about 20% if the Lib Dems have to take a decision of the kind; 80% of it will be about the numbers. 10. Tim Farron must be favourite to become next Lib Dem leader if the coalition fails. Farron has had fairly good week. Some parliamentary colleagues find him sanctimonious and irritating, but he has now firmly established himself as the pre-eminent candidate from the left in any future leadership contest. If the coalition parties do badly at the next election – perhaps because the economy is still in dire straits, and government ministers are getting the blame – then it is hard to see how Chris Huhne, Vince Cable or anyone else could beat him in a leadership contest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/mar/20/tory-simon-kirby-royal-wedding","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-20T00:05:00Z","webTitle":"Tory MP Simon Kirby, once a royal-baiting anarchist, will be cheering for Wills and Kate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/20/tory-simon-kirby-royal-wedding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/mar/20/tory-simon-kirby-royal-wedding","fields":{"headline":"Tory MP Simon Kirby, once a royal-baiting anarchist, will be cheering for Wills and Kate","bodyText":"If the manner in which Tory MP Simon Kirby celebrated the last major royal wedding is anything to go by, the constituents of Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven are in for something of a surprise. A photograph has emerged revealing that Kirby, now an avowed fan of the royal family, has not always been a signed-up member of the establishment. On the day of the marriage of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer, Kirby snubbed the street parties in his home town to don a blazer and checked shirt for a day of drinking with a group then known as the Hastings Anarchists. It wasn't 16-year-old Kirby's first encounter with the ragtag group of 20 or so believers in a leaderless society. A fellow anarchist at that time, Melita Dennett, said: \"Simon was a regular fixture for about a year. We were involved in hunt sabotaging and protests against nuclear power. We had quite a bit of fun but we were serious about our beliefs. \"We used to write a Private Eye-style magazine, the Poison Pen, and I believe he read that, liked what we stood for and that is how he got involved. I don't remember too much about him except he was rather nerdy in appearance and he had just left Hastings grammar school. \"We spent the day of the Diana and Charles wedding drinking on West Hill, in Hastings, in protest. There was a recession on and we just didn't think it was right. As far as I remember, he lost contact with people when he went to Brighton Polytechnic, but this was obviously all before he found his true home in the Conservative party.\" The photograph shows Kirby sporting an unkempt fringe at the back of the group of activists. To his right, a blonde woman holds up a poster of the royal couple, published in the Daily Star newspaper, but the face of the Prince of Wales has been defaced to include a small moustache. Kirby, who is now 46 and married with six children, made his fortune when he sold a chain of pubs for £14m in 2000. He insists that he is not ashamed of his anarchist past – or, at least, the bits that he can remember. The former councillor, who was elected to parliament for the first time last year, said: \"I don't have a particularly colourful past but I did go to quite a few parties and I am rather surprised I can remember anything at all of that one.\" He added: \"It was my sister's birthday party that day and I think I was just passing through. But as a young man I read into a lot of different ideologies before finding my home as a Conservative and, actually, I would encourage others to do the same.\" However, he insisted he had no plans to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in a similar fashion. \"I am a fan of the monarchy now and think they do a good job for the country. On the day of the wedding I shall be joining my constituents at street parties where they will be celebrating a day off and the happy occasion.\" According to his website, Kirby's interests now include \"campaigning for sensible development policies in the constituency\". He is also, his site explains, \"opposed to the proposals to redevelop the [Brighton] marina with large-scale housing schemes\". He sits on the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/23/spain-socialists-election-consensus","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-23T19:22:03Z","webTitle":"Spain's impossible realists | Ignacio Escolar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/23/spain-socialists-election-consensus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/23/spain-socialists-election-consensus","fields":{"headline":"Spain's impossible realists","bodyText":"After Sunday's municipal and regional elections, two-party politics in Spain is dead. The rightwing PP (People's party) appears to have secured a complete stranglehold on Spanish political power. The results defy even the worst predictions for the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' party), which were already pretty pessimistic. And beyond their defeat in the regional elections, and their opponents' victory by 10 percentage points, we mustn't forget the hundreds of independent parties that have won votes in the municipal elections – votes which, in the forthcoming general election, are likely to go to the PP. Had these been the general elections, the same results would have gifted a large majority to the PP's leader Mariano Rajoy, comparable to that of José María Aznar in 2000. Other minor parties have gained strength, but the right now rules. Why such a huge defeat for the socialists? One thing that's clear is that people haven't voted simply on the basis of regional or municipal issues, and Prime Minister Zapatero's announcement that he would step down before the next elections seems to have had little effect. Behind the socialists' defeat lies Spain's dire unemployment, their denial of the financial crisis at its outset, and, without a doubt, the events of the month of May. Not the events of this May, though – not the sit-in in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol square a week ago which has quickly turned into the national protest movement popularly known as 15-M, nor the arduous election campaign itself. I'm referring to May 2010, when Zapatero, having just slashed public spending in order to prevent the markets from derailing Spanish bonds, promised the country that he would carry on, \"no matter what it costs, and no matter what it costs me\". The cuts probably staved off a bailout, but that month unquestionably marked the beginning of his end. With less than a year to go before the general elections, it's hard to see how the socialists could recover to the extent that they'll be able to hold back the conservatives, who will immediately start working to garner further support. What the socialists need now, even more than primary elections, is a complete rethink. Meanwhile, at the protests in Madrid's Puerta del Sol, everything is being debated. Absolutely everything. The madrileños who have turned out are realists – and that's why they're asking for the impossible. People are discussing how to renounce nuclear power, abolish bullfighting, implement a secular state. Anyone who has turned out at these gatherings – and seen how all kinds of different people, megaphone in hand, are putting forward ideas about how to improve the world – will have seen that something truly exceptional is happening in Madrid. Nevertheless, beyond the Puerta del Sol there's the rest of Spanish society. And if we want the momentum which the \"Spanish revolution\" has generated to continue and have a real impact, we need to distinguish the short term from the long term, broad goals from specific ones. Firstly, we need to establish which principles we all (or nearly all) agree on; in doing so we can begin to create a clear framework in which democracy can improve, rather than a specific electoral programme. I propose that we reform our electoral law, by introducing a system of open lists for voting in members of our Congress, and by making parliament reflect the reality of electoral results according to the \"criteria of proportional representation\", as demanded by the constitution. We need a freedom of information law, too. Spain is one of only five countries in the EU which still lacks this, and it is fundamental if we are to control how public money is spent and stop its misuse. The PSOE featured the proposal in their 2004-2008 electoral programme, but, like so many other promises, it came to nothing. I would like to see a referendum over the bailout of the banks. And how about we reform the laws governing the financing of political parties and people in public office, making their income and expenses more transparent. I know my views aren't shared by everyone. I oppose nuclear energy, I'm in favour of a secular state, I'd like to see bullfighting abolished, and I'm against the sustainable economy (Sinde) bill, which controls internet usage. But I would like to believe that from the Puerta del Sol there will emerge some kind of consensus that's shared by the large majority of Spanish people, not only those who think as I do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/18/ftse-up-on-g7-intervention","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-18T09:38:00Z","webTitle":"Amec advances while FTSE 100 gains ground on G7 currency intervention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/18/ftse-up-on-g7-intervention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/18/ftse-up-on-g7-intervention","fields":{"headline":"Amec advances while FTSE 100 gains ground on G7 currency intervention","bodyText":"Markets are edging higher for the second day after the G7 intervened in the currency markets to help weaken the yen, but the rise is by no means convincing. Apart from the continuing Japanese nuclear crisis, investors are - rightly - nervous about how the situation in Libya will play out, given the UN's vote for a no-fly zone over the country and possible air strikes. Unrest in Bahrain and fears it could spill over into major oil producer Saudi Arabia is also causing concern, helping push the oil price up more than $1 a barrel to $116. European banking stress tests - which are due to start any time now - have also put the spotlight back onto the sovereign debt crisis, despite last week's EU agreement to raise the bail-out fund. All in all the FTSE 100 has climbed 30.57 points to 5726.68, with French and German markets up just over 0.5%. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index, said: Several tensions remain over the Japanese nuclear situation and the UN vote for a no fly zone in Libya are likely to keep traders somewhat sensitive, particularly having seen the price of crude oil jump in the last 12 hours. Should [the] no fly zone agreement turn into air strikes on Gaddafi's forces, this could certainly be an aspect traders may react to. Amec is leading the risers, up 33p to £11.44, helped by Investec starting coverage with a buy recommendation. The company has been hit recently by concerns about its nuclear business if the Japanese problems mean delays or cancellations to planned projects. But the company also provides services to oil and gas customers, and that is an area that would benefit from any nuclear slowdown. The current high oil price also gives further impetus to explorers and producers of crude. Gas producers should also benefit, as analyst Simon Miller from Northland Capital Partners said: The accident at the Fukushima Nuclear plant is a major setback for nuclear power, notwithstanding the power station is 40 years old uses previous generation technology and is located in a notoriously earthquake prone region. However while alternative energy technologies are currently enjoying their day in the sun, neither wind nor solar are a viable alternative to Nuclear. Gas is the obvious short to medium term beneficiary and in addition to the major gas producers it would not be unreasonable to expect those companies servicing the oil and gas sector to benefit as well. In particular he singles out Hamworthy, currently 2.75p lower at 479.5p. The company supplies systems for the oil and gas industry, notably for handling LNG, in offshore production platforms, LNG carriers and terminals. Orders have already picked up but this could accelerate as questions over the future of nuclear continue. On the same theme Petrofac has added 30p to £14.26 and Weir is up 33p to £16.39. Elsewhere Barclays is down 3.15p to 280.4p in the wake of reports it may be involved in a regulatory investigation into libor, the interbank interest rate benchmark. But Royal Bank of Scotland is up 0.02p to 40.87p on talk it has been sounding out institutions about the sale of the UK government's stake. National Grid is up 13.5p at 566p after a positive recommendation from Credit Suisse which said: We stay overweight regulated utilities which we continue to see as cheap index-linked bond proxies and an inflation hedge. But Next lost 20p to £19.32 and Marks &amp; Spencer fell 3p to 332.1p after a downgrade from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/filmblog/2011/apr/08/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-japan-fukushima-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-08T11:03:40Z","webTitle":"The powerful resonances of Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/08/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-japan-fukushima-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/08/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-japan-fukushima-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"The powerful resonances of Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker","bodyText":"The test of a great film is not its relevance to world events. La Belle et la Bête doesn't suffer for its lack of insight into Libyan mission creep; The Shining needs no message about the Portuguese bailout. But now and then one of cinema's true moments of genius is brought to mind by the nightly news – and so it's been recently with Stalker, Andrei Tarkovsky's unshakable science-fiction masterwork, a film that ever since the crippling of the Fukushima nuclear power plant has, for me, been a mournful companion to the crisis. Because if the exact nature of this most beautifully cryptic of films will always be open to debate, it will also be forever linked with Chernobyl – Tarkovsky's 1979 vision of the eerie, depopulated \"Zone\" on at least one level an uncannily prophetic vision of the \"zone of alienation\" thrown up around the ruined reactor number four after its conflagration seven years later. So lately, for all the repeated assurances that nuclear history isn't repeating itself, I've found it impossible not to see the dying concrete husk of Fukushima 1 and picture the forsaken world of Stalker as the conclusion. Re-watching the film again now (always a joy), the echoes come thick and fast. If the Zone with its untamed fauna and totemic black dog prefaced Chernobyl's slow return of its site to the wild then that, too, would seem the likely fate for the land around Fukushima – the abandoned pets and farm animals already loose in streets from which people have vanished, a new contender for Tarkovsky's title of \"quietest place in the world\". The plant itself, meanwhile, finds its mirror in the vast, brooding power station from which the three protagonists set out on their uncertain voyage of discovery. And most striking of all, there's the invisible but all-pervasive danger at every step – radiation in the Chernobyl reading of the movie – and the jarringly primitive measures taken to combat it, in the film metal bolts attached to strips of bandage, at Fukushima sawdust and shredded newspaper. Off-screen, the resonances keep up. After all, Stalker, like each of its director's films, was the work of a man whose interest in Japanese culture fell somewhere between keen and obsessive. Not only was there an abiding passion for the work of Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa (to whom I've even seen it mooted that an \"AK\" chalked on a wall in an early scene of Stalker was a tribute), but there was also a fascination with haiku, the enigmatic lessons of which seep into Stalker at every turn. Elsewhere, the Japanese connections were still more clearcut: the famed highway sequence of Solaris, probably the most wildly hypnotic five minutes of film I've ever seen, was shot in Tokyo's Akasaka district, from where British reporters wrote last month of stripped-bare supermarkets and contagious fear of radioactive dust clouds. But Stalker itself had a catastrophic history. While it's a well-known part of the film's legend that it had to be shot twice after the original film stock was ruined in the lab, it's less talked about that the entire production had by then already had to vacate its original location in northern Tajikistan after a major earthquake. Touched as such by disaster in its early life, the film would end up embraced by it. While the last month saw Tokyo's drinking water deemed unfit for children, the toxic legacy of eventually filming near a chemical plant outside the Estonian capital of Tallinn has been blamed for killing both lead actor Anatoli Solonitsyn and in 1986, just a few months after Chernobyl, Tarkovsky himself. Earlier this week it would have been his 79th birthday – there could hardly be a better moment to raise a glass."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/14/barack-obama-budget-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-14T16:36:27Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama 2012 budget provides $8bn for clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/14/barack-obama-budget-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/14/barack-obama-budget-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama 2012 budget provides $8bn for clean energy","bodyText":"President Barack Obama proposed on Monday to boost funds for clean energy research and deployment in his 2012 budget by slashing subsidies for fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. The budget provides the Department of Energy with $29.5bn (£18.4bn) for the fiscal year 2012, up 4.2% from the proposed 2011 budget, and up 12% from the enacted 2010 budget. Some $8bn would support research in clean energy like wind, solar and advanced batteries. \"Whomever leads in the global, clean energy economy will also take the lead in creating high-paying, highly skilled jobs for its people,\" the administration said in the budget. The budget would also provide $853m to support new nuclear energy technologies, such as small modular reactors. The White House asked for $36bn in federal loan guarantees to help finance the building of nuclear power plants, as it did last year. The loan programme already has $18bn in authority. To help pay for the clean energy initiatives, the White House is asking Congress to repeal $3.6bn in oil, natural gas and coal subsidies, a move that would total $46.2bn over a decade. In addition, the budget cuts funding for oil and gas research and for hydrogen fuels programmes. But many Republicans oppose cutting subsidies for fossil fuels, saying it would hurt industries that provide jobs while the economy is still fragile. \"Given the broad difference in priorities between House Republicans and the White House on energy issues, we believe that few of the proposed cuts and expansions ... will become law,\" Whitney Stanco, an energy policy analyst at MF Global, said in a research note. Republicans, who now have control of the House of Representatives, have also proposed to cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) programme to regulate greenhouse gases, saying Congress should be the one to decide whether to fight climate change, not the administration. Republicans may try to force a government shutdown if the Obama administration does not agree to its spending cuts. But analysts said a delay in EPA climate regulations led by Congress was more likely than shutting down the government over an environmental rule. The Obama budget cuts the 2012 EPA budget by about $1.3bn or about 13% with reductions in a clean diesel programme and in Great Lakes restoration projects. Stanco said the budget's funding for electric vehicles could be likeliest to make it into law as it could be paired with funding for natural gas vehicles. The budget proposes $588m for vehicle technologies, an increase of 88% from current levels. The budget would double the number of energy innovation hubs to six to bring scientists to work on topics like rare earth elements, energy storage and batteries and development of smart grid technologies designed to make electricity transmission efficient."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2011/apr/05/letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T12:59:01Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 8 April 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/apr/05/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2011/apr/05/letters","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 8 April 2011","bodyText":"Having lived in Germany since shortly after reunification, for most of that time in the former East Germany, my reaction to the points expressed in your article 'Working like crazy' and babies prove an unachievable mix (25 March) is positive. The real situation is accurately reflected. I have three comments. First, the speed with which the east took on the mindset of the west after re-unification regarding the position of women in the workplace, having babies etc. My East German-born wife was for 20 years a midwife working in large maternity unit in Saxony. In 1989 the unit had 3,700 births (more than 10 a day) and in less than three years that had been reduced to 850 per year, resulting in her redundancy. Second, the expectation that women with children stay at home and don't contribute to the working environment is still very powerful in the west. My eldest stepdaughter is now a lone mother living in the west with three children under seven years of age, has to work and has a good job, but finds it desperately difficult to find good childcare facilities to cover all of her full-time hours the year round, something that would have been unheard of in the former GDR. Finally, even though maternity/paternity is a legal right, fathers who want to take two months off to spend with their newborn child find themselves under enormous pressure from male managers not to opt for this right and to stay at their post resulting, for example, in some cases in the man finding his prospects of job enhancement reduced. Such is life in post re-unified Germany. Michael Booth Kassel, Germany Many more Chernobyls What springs to mind for me, as I observe the nuclear disaster in Japan not improving after several weeks, is a friend's comment 25 years ago: \"How many more Chernobyls will it take till people wake up?\" ('No schedule' for nuclear safety, 1 April). So the upside of this situation is that right now many people are waking up: some to the dangers of nuclear power so huge that it is insured by governments as a massive hidden subsidy, because meltdown could bankrupt private insurers; some to the wholesale denial of the unsustainable nature of consumer capitalism with its short-term thinking, of which nuclear power is emblematic. Let's not forget that Fukushima could start spreading plutonium into the world, every particle of which is deadly poisonous to all animal life for thousands of years. Are we insane to take such risks? Yes, in my opinion, but it's not too late. Another world is possible. Edward Butterworth Victoria, BC, Canada The war against Gaddafi There are lot of misnomers floating about in all this belching miasma about Libya, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and his loyal supporters (UN-backed Libya assault begins, 25 March). We could begin with the \"no-fly zone\", which is not a \"no-fly\" zone at all, but a carte-blanche invitation for the bellicose, warmongering, trigger-happy invaders from the west to do their wicked worst to get rid of Gaddafi by all the explosive means at their disposal – with impunity. Second, we could consider the newfound tender concern expressed for precious and vulnerable \"civilian casualties\". Anyone who can remember anything at all knows full well that the US, in particular, couldn't care a tinker's cuss about \"civilian casualties\". Just remember the horrible carnage in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan for blatant examples of their callousness in this regard. They didn't even bother to count the dead, never mind shedding crocodile tears about them. As for all the others in the so-called coalition, just round up the usual suspects: the US and its retinue of servile yes men – Britain, Australia, France, Canada and the rest. Then we get \"UN-approved strikes\" and \"the international community\", as if the elite UN security council truly represents the considered opinion of every serious thinking person on earth, instead of the ill-judged confusion of an image-obsessed US president, anxious to out-Bush his mindless predecessor, suffering from delusions of grandeur. Dave Diss Glengowrie, South Australia • Gaddafi has described the Nato-led attacks on Libya as \"crusader\", and in a way he's right. We no longer come carrying the Bible and a sharpened crucifix, but our obsessive campaigning for what we call \"democracy\" is a crusade by any other name. Once again western politicians should be careful what they wish for: how democratic are our own political systems, for instance? Recent proposed changes to the UK electoral process have not met with much sympathy in some party HQs. And what country can call itself democratic when its upper house of parliament follows a feudal system of \"appointments\", whose members never submit to the hustings and keep their seats for life? A little reality check wouldn't go amiss in Downing Street bunkers. Peter Hoare Quorn, Leicestershire, UK Going beyond the law I applaud Jenny Goldie for wanting to defend migrant women's rights (Reply, 25 March), but deplore the methods she proposes that include the need to \"go beyond what is allowed by law\". Telling law-abiding citizens what they can or cannot do smacks very much of Big Brother. Forcing your values on those that have different ones is an even greater conceit. One of the very great qualities exhibited by American (in particular), British and (I had hoped) Australian society is a notion of tolerance – indeed this is one of the key areas in which the west can claim genuine moral superiority over many totalitarian, less progressive cultures. However, telling people what they can wear is not in keeping with this value or with the important principle of personal liberty our societies enjoy. Moreover, presuming to impose one's beliefs and values on different cultures is not the best way to win them over to our ways – which is surely the ultimate aim. Indeed such threatening, insensitive behaviour merely drives migrant cultures away from societal integration and into isolation – in turn exacerbating multicultural tensions. Far better is to lead by example: show and put into practice the very best of our customs such as tolerance and respect for civil liberties. Education is key. But people can only learn if they want to. Minority cultures are more likely to want to learn from us if they feel welcomed by society, rather than threatened. I do not doubt that many female migrants encounter oppression within the home, but attacking their culture is not conducive to changing it. In Australia, a woman chooses to wear a burqa because that is her choice. If she does not wish to, the law will protect her from being forced to do so. Of course her choice is not so simple; but if we indulge in the hypocrisy of dictating what she can wear, then we have sunk to the very behaviour that so rightly outraged us to begin with. Martin Dupont Kanagawa, Japan Briefly • Could the April holiday exodus that you report (18 March) have something to do with the fact that Friday 29 April, the day of the Royal Wedding, is going to be a public holiday? By taking only three days of their annual leave, workers in Britain can in fact enjoy a 10-day break thanks to two successive long weekends (Easter and the Royal Wedding). Moya Jones Artigues près Bordeaux, France • Jason Burke cites Sarah Palin as \"famously saying that Russia could be seen from Alaska\" as suggesting her \"ignorance of international affairs\" (25 March). But as every Alaskan knows, Russia's Ratmanov Island in the Bering Strait is only 2.5km distant, and easily visible, from Alaska's Little Diomede Island. Perhaps Burke had Palin confused with Tina Fey, who in a Palin parody said, \"I can see Russia from my house.\" I agree that Palin's comments on both foreign affairs and much else make it tempting to believe, but she is not stupid. Her show of ignorance is a deceit practised on those truly stupid people who regard ignorance as evidence of upright character. Ian MacDougall Tokyo, Japan • We colonials who had the advantage of a \"British\"-style education were taught this rule about pronunciation: \"In polysyllabic words the emphasis should be put on the antepenultimate syllable – ie the third-last (25 March). That means that conTROVersy and aPPLICable are the correct pronunciations of these words, as the Oxford English Dictionary says, and not some newfangled American way of pronouncing them. Penelope Fox Ocean Shores, NSW, Australia • Matthew 25: 14-30 is the only thing to say to the \"wicked and slothful\" nuns at Santa Lucia, Zaragoza (25 March) who, for reasons known only to themselves – unless they are simply \"unprofitable servants\" – chose to hide $2m in black bin liners of which they were relieved by an anonymous party. They can spare us their \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\".

Consider it a bit of light relief between a not very interesting election debate and a day of PEFO, costings and black holes tomorrow. Thanks very much for your company throughout the day - and thanks too to Paul Owen and Mike Bowers. Let's say goodnight for now. Today, Monday, week two: Tony Abbott went to Melbourne and deemed today about infrastructure and roads funding. Kevin Rudd was in Sydney, and had a manufacturing and skills day. Both the leaders unwound from the televised election debate on Sunday evening. The Liberals continued outrage about Kevin Rudd's use of notes during the election debate. Rudd blamed his staff for the mix up, and insisted he acted in good faith. There was some anticipatory jousting between Labor and the Liberals ahead of new pre-election economic forecasts to be unveiled tomorrow at 10am. Rest up. Have a lovely evening. See you tomorrow. Tony Abbott looking at .. traffic. Innovation minister Kim Carr looking at Kevin Rudd looking at .. gorgeous baby. Reporters looking at Kevin Rudd .. et al. Sweeping up before we do the summary for this evening. No sooner have we all recovered from the first election debate, and we are on to the next phase of proceedings. Sky News will host a people's forum at Broncos in Brisbane on Wednesday August 21. The Liberal leader Tony Abbott (who wants this format) has agreed to attend. Not Kevin Rudd, at least thus far. Now, speaking as we were, of Corangamite, there is a news report this afternoon that requires sharing. Huge parties. Hot models? What the .. Here's an excerpt from the report on Yahoo. A Palmer United Party candidate in Victoria is promising a 'huge party' with 'hot models' and possibly a 'mystery rock band' for volunteers willing to fight for his cause. PUP candidate for Corangamite Buddy Rojek is on the lookout for 150 volunteers to help him on the campaign trail. In return, Mr Rojek has promised to throw the rocking party, with DJs and mingling models, for 300 people. “My parties go off!!!” he assures potential volunteers in the campaign 'pamphlet' (it’s actually just a sheet of printed A4 paper) \"Kevin 13 party is for nerds!\" he claims. Those of us in the \"live\" space this election have been having a bit of fun on Twitter this afternoon about this moment on Sky News just a little while ago. The lady in the front is health minister Tanya Plibersek. The gent in the background is Darren Cheeseman, who holds the very very marginal seat of Corangamite. This is a \"noddy\". It's the rather silly practice of local MPs standing brazenly in shot while a principal is being interviewed so the voters don't forget about them. Cheeseman said not one word. Why was he there, Sky political editor David Speers inquired? Because he was proud of his achievements for Corangamite was the explanation. We can run on our record Lyndal. The Liberal deputy leader Julie Bishop is on ABC24 right now, with political editor Lyndal Curtis. Bishop is telling Curtis the Coalition will produce savings in good time before polling day. When, Curtis inquires. You won't pin me down on a time Lyndal, is the answer. Labor, Bishop says, should not be precious about producing savings, given they put their policies into treasury at the last minute in 2010. And when it comes to fiscal credibility - votes trust the Coaliton, not Labor. With PEFO tomorrow - those with delicate sensibilities should avoid the televsion news bulletins this evening I think. I can see an obvious segue looming between Tony Abbott's remark this morning about not being the suppository of all wisdom and the potential for black holes tomorrow. Perhaps my forecast will prove incorrect. In any case, let no more be said on this matter. Political blogger Paula Matthewson, via Twitter. We can only hope Paula. Now, let's look ahead to tomorrow. I don't have a time confirmed yet, but Treasury will release the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook sometime Tuesday. These are independent numbers from the departments of treasury and finance. The Coalition is currently executing a small, hedged pivot to allow it to use the new treasury numbers if it believes them valid. The Liberals have complained that treasury forecasts cannot be believed because officials have been bullied by the government into providing unbelievable forecasts. Now, the Liberals say it will look at the PEFO numbers. This was Tony Abbott this morning, at his press conference: We have got the Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook coming out tomorrow. We will carefully study that, we will have more to say about savings quite soon and you will have our full fiscal statement in good time before the next election. The PEFO figures are the best figures we have got, no doubt about that. The problem is that none of the figures that have been released under this government have been reliable. Every forecast, every figure has been subject to revision after revision, after revision. We can’t vouch for the starting point. All we can do is vouch for the difference which we will make. That is all we can vouch for, the difference that we will make and people will know in good time before the election what we are spending, what we are saving, what the difference will be to the bottom line. Overall the budget bottom line will always be strong under the Coalition. And the shadow assistant treasurer, Mathias Cormann, on Sky News a few minutes ago, about PEFO: We accept that they are treasury and finances best estimate of the current state of the budget. We will study the document carefully. We'll continue to go through proper methodical process. We'll provide a response to PEFO once we've had a chance to study it. Thanks muchly to political blogger Malcolm Farnsworth, for this little gem from the archive of 2008. He's posted a piece from Labor's new candidate for Hotham, Claire O'Neill. O'Neill reflections in the piece are from a visit by John Howard to Harvard in March 2008. O'Neill was then a masters student. There's no big yarn here, just a youthful voice. (I don't hate Howard - but man, is he dull. If this man has periods of introspection, he hides them well.) O'Neill: Unlike many Labor activists, I don’t hate Howard. I feel enormous respect for anyone who chooses to devote themselves so fully to Australian public life. It’s pretty easy to bay from the sidelines, not so easy to get involved and take responsibility for where the country is headed. So, I mean no discourtesy when I say that Howard greatly disappointed me. He lacked substance, spice, and displayed a terrifying lack of reflection about his time in office. For so long, I believed that this was simply part of his pedestrian political style. Surely, during his 11-and-a-half years in Australia’s highest office, deep ruminations were forming beneath the surface? If there were, he chose not to share them on his visit to Harvard. Speaking of north Queensland, here comes the Rudd plane. Sam Hawley is an ABC political correspondent, on the road with the Labor leader this week. O'Neill was elected by the ALP national executive this afternoon. Labor has also signed up Andrew Turnour in the Queensland seat of Kennedy. Lucky Turnour - he gets the face-off with the KAP's Bob Katter. Update: 4.14pm. ALP national secretary George Wright has confirmed the preselections in a statement. Wright: Clare O’Neil has been preselected for the federal electorate of Hotham and Andrew Turnour has been preselected for the federal electorate of Kennedy. I am pleased they will now join Labor’s team fighting for a positive plan for Australia’s future. Clare O’Neil is a former Mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong and holds a Masters Degree in public policy from Harvard University, where she was a Fulbright Scholar and also has a Bachelor of Laws from Monash University. Andrew is an experienced project engineer who holds a Bachelor of Engineering with honours from Monash University. Mr Turnour contested the seat of Kennedy at the 2010 federal election. Ms O’Neil was elected unanimously by the national executive and Mr Turnour was elected unopposed. Meanwhile, in the breaking news space, there are reports this afternoon that Claire O'Neill has won preselection for the seat of Hotham. Fairfax Media's Henrietta Cook says: \"A 32-year-old former mayor has won the messy preselection battle for the safe Labor seat of Hotham following the sacking of a candidate who had verbally abused a wheelchair-bound councillor. Clare O'Neil, who at 23 became the youngest female mayor in Australian history, is being backed by the National Union of Workers faction.\" Kevin Rudd dumped Labor's original candidate Geoff Lake after reports surfaced that he'd abused a fellow councillor in 2002. Meanwhile, in the land of innovative interwebz. (What was that famous line from The Simpsons Movie - from the Arnold Schwarzenegger character - I was elected to lead, not read?) I know the country has moved on from the lady we no longer mention: the one who used to live in The Lodge. But interesting to note the ANU poll had a gender question. The analysis here would suggest that Australia is entirely relaxed and comfortable with women in politics (which, sadly, wasn't my lived experience watching events over the past three years.) Here's the findings and analysis: The issue of gender and political representation has been an underlying theme throughout the 2010-13 period, with the election of Australia’s first female prime minister, Julia Gillard. The survey asked the respondents if they believed that a man or a woman would perform better as an MP in representing their interests. The results show that the vast majority – 87 per cent – saw no difference in the job that a man or a woman would do. Men were slightly more likely to favour a man for the job than a woman, while women were equally divided. overall, the differences were minor. Just one per cent of the respondents had no view on the question, reflecting the widespread debate about the issue of gender and politics over the past three years. I really don't want to tempt fate by observing that this afternoon is the first afternoon I've been able to hear myself think since the campaign got underway. But it is great: a moment to think. Here's something interesting to share. New results from the Australian National University poll of voter attitudes. Public concern about the economy and job security has doubled since 2010, while concern about global warming has halved. More than half of the people surveyed in the latest ANUpoll listed the economy and jobs among the most important issues Australia is facing right now. The second most important issue was immigration and asylum seekers, which was nominated by 28 per cent of the 1,200 randomly surveyed people. Meanwhile, six per cent of respondents cited the environment or global warming as an issue, down from around 12 per cent in 2010. Only 0.1 per cent of people mentioned the carbon tax. “The poll results suggest that the management of the economy will be centre-stage in the federal election campaign,” said Professor Ian McAllister from the ANU School of Research School of Politics and International Relations. “By contrast, the environment and climate change are seen by voters as a much lesser concern than previously, and there has been a dramatic decline in those mentioning the carbon tax as an important issue. The declining importance of these issues has implications for the Australian Greens party support.” That little bit of goodness from Norway does remind me to share one of my all time favourite political ads - from the Best Party of Iceland. A pitch that never gets old. Imagine if Kevin Rudd took time off from the campaign to drive a taxi. No, actually, don't. Just check this out. It's the video of the day. Norway's prime minister Jens Stoltenberg worked secretly as a taxi driver in central Oslo for a day in June, leaving his passengers wondering whether their elected leader had quit the day job. An hour or so after lunchtime (sorry about that), here's the lunchtime summary: It was the morning after the night before in terms of election debates. The Liberal leader Tony Abbott declared the encounter incredibly interesting. To my knowledge he is the only person to do so. The Liberals were upset that Kevin Rudd had used notes during the Sunday night encounter in breach of the rules. Rudd blamed his staff for failing to advise him of the rules, and observed that he preferred to debate with some facts at his disposal. Unlike .. well .. fill in the blanks. Today is transport day, and making things day. Kevin Rudd spoke of manufacturing jobs at Macquarie University. Tony Abbott spoke specifically of roads in Victoria, and generally about the virtues of bulldozers on the ground and cranes in the air. Labor attempted to turn this positive message into a negative message about cuts, deploying a casual remark Abbott made about the Kennett era in Victoria being something of a golden age. (Not much of a golden age for the public servants shown the door by the pro-privatisation Kennett - that kind of thing.) Out of respect for you (and for the Liberal leader) I won't mention Tony Abbott's suppository of wisdom remark beyond noting that it happened. I will also note but not labour the shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison's observation this morning that the asylum seekers sent to PNG will wait until low tide before walking back. Call it boat fatigue. Now the word is Kevin Rudd's press pack is heading north. My guess? The seats of Dawson and Herbert. Donk. Sorry about that Mr Abbott. It has been wrong of me, in my little Tumblr riff today, not to point you all to the original and the best in this genre in Australia: Tony Abbott looking at things If you haven't seen it, and you need a laugh, have a look. Now I'm through the make-off explanation I can post Mike Bowers's lovely picture of baby Paddy. As campaign baby shots go, Mike and I give this one five stars. Paddy's mother, Mike advises, told her boy not to spit on the prime minister. The shadow treasurer Joe Hockey has been out and about in Adelaide this morning. Given he's been in Adelaide - a major Australian centre for automotive manufacturing - Hockey was of course asked about his plans for supporting the car industry. The Coalition, thus far at least, is promising less dollars in overall support for automotive manufacturers. Labor attacks the Coalition regularly for that point of difference. Hockey was asked this morning about Holden, and the Coalition's disposition toward the company. Holden is currently considering its operations in Australia. The shadow treasurer said he'd had some discussions with Holden's Australian CEO. Hockey isn't giving any Holden-specific commitments at this stage - except a commitment not to proceed with Labor's controversial plans to tighten the fringe benefits tax rules. Labor is proposing a crackdown on the FBT arrangements for company cars. This integrity measure, worth $1.8bn, has gone down very poorly in the automotive industry. Hockey told reporters that the Coalition would be the best friend the car industry ever had because it wouldn't proceed with the tax impost, and it would kick start economic growth - so more people would head to the car yard to buy a new vehicle. Part of today's major party make-off is a preamble to the release tomorrow of the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook. We'll have a look at that PEFO/costings debate over the course of this afternoon - time and events permitting. We've established that today is a 'make-off' day in the campaign. Tony Abbott is out today with a positive topline message about building roads and infrastructure. Kevin Rudd has been speaking about the importance of manufacturing and high tech jobs. Let's walk through a campaign counterpoint Labor is trying to set up today. Abbott said this, by way of general framing, in Melbourne this morning: I think it’s very important for confidence that we see cranes over our cities, that we see bulldozers on the ground. If we want to give the people of Australia a shot in the arm, if we want to convince them that things are happening, there’s almost nothing better than seeing new roads underway. I would like to think that should we win the election, I will be known as an infrastructure Prime Minister, because we need the infrastructure of the 21st century if we are going to have the prosperity, if we are going to have the productivity that the people of Australia need. Labor has also picked up on a stray remark from that same Abbott press conference this morning. Abbott: I think that a lot of people look back on the Kennett era and say it was a golden age of development so all credit to Jeff Kennett for the work he’s done. Jeff Kennett of course was the Liberal premier of Victoria. A statement from Labor campaign headquarters this morning has some other facts about the Kennett era: Jeff Kennett sacked 50,000 public servants. Jeff Kennett closed 300 schools and sacked more than 9,000 teachers. Jeff Kennett closed 17 hospitals and made 3,500 nurses and 10,000 health workers unemployed. Jeff Kennett sacked 16,000 public transport workers. Jeff Kennett made Campbell Newman looked restrained. Yet, Mr Abbott says: “all credit to Jeff”. So let's put these steps together. Tony Abbott is using today to tell voters he wants to be a prime minister who builds things and makes things. It's a more expansive message. Labor wants to keep Abbott in the cuts frame, not in the expansive frame. So the Kennett remark is being used to turn a positive remark into a negative one. There's a sub-set of this debate which I'll deal with in the next post. Late entry in the 'looking at things' impromptu Tumblr. Tony Abbott looking at Victorian premier Dennis Napthine. A staffer looking at Tony Abbott, taking a Twitpic, and tweeting it. Just for the record, this was the 'announceable' from Macquarie University this morning - a program called Manufacturing Skills Plus. The Rudd Labor Government will provide an extra $35.6 million to train around 6,800 new and existing workers in the manufacturing sector and to help manage an economy in transition. These new training places are for businesses seeking to shift from low tech to high tech manufacturing processes and technologies. The issue of unauthorised boat arrivals is still thundering through the campaign news cycle this morning. Let's catch up. From The Cairns Post today: Asylum seekers have found their own PNG solution, with two Somalis the latest to sail from Australia's nearest neighbour across the Torres Strait, headed for far north Queensland. Premier Campbell Newman warned the new front across the porous border would open up after the Federal Government vowed to send all boat arrivals to PNG or Nauru. Customs and immigration officers found the two Somalis on remote Boigu Island, 6km south of PNG, on Saturday morning. They were taken to Thursday Island for health checks, with the Federal Government vowing to send them to Manus Island or Nauru for resettlement. Hundreds of Somalis have arrived on asylum boats off Christmas Island this year. Another boat was intercepted at Saibai Island, 4km south of PNG, carrying two West Papuans on Friday. The shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison, and the shadow attorney-general George Brandis - quite the press conference double act in recent days - are holding a media event now to suggest the people now off to PNG will shortly walk back across to the Torres Strait islands at the next shallow tide. The Morrison/Brandis message: PNG is the new jumping off point for Australia. Our northern border is our weakest link. And Kevin Rudd has .. opened up the borders of northern Australia to people smugglers. The deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop isn't buying what Kevin Rudd is selling on 'note gate.' Rudd is asked if his PNG solution is working? He says there's been a 30% drop in boat arrivals since the policy was introduced. We take this one step at a time. On 'note gate': should you have taken notes to last night, and can you see how some people might see this behaviour in the election debate as a breach of trust? Rudd blames the advisers. He says if someone had said to me don't take notes, then sure, that's fine. I was in receipt of no such advice. I acted in good faith. He says he prefers to deal in facts and have them at his disposal. Others can just stick to their slogans. One of your candidates supports nuclear power. That's not Labor's policy. Opinion polls - are you worried? No, says Rudd. There's a way to go. Kim Carr is bursting to contribute. Rudd waves him in. Carr says negative campaigns by special interests are having an impact, but you press on. A question on Labor's GST campaign. We raise this issue because a tax hike on the GST hits everyone, Rudd says. What Tony Abbott says on the state premiers having to agree to any change is not correct - parliament can change the GST if it wants. If Abbott doesn't want to change the GST, why is it in his tax review? Preferences? I'm not involved in those talks, speak to the national secretary. Are you playing politics on gay marriage? I answered the question at last night's election debate directly. We will give our people a free vote, Tony Abbott won't. A second Sydney Airport - do you get that this is a big issue in this city? Mr Infrastructure is on to it, Rudd says. It's big for Sydney, I get it. Anthony Albanese (the transport minister, \"Mr Infrastructure\") is on to it. A question on tomorrow's pre-election economic and fiscal outlook? Labor respects the forecasting process. I would just request that Mr Abbott be subjected to the same discipline. Labor's innovation minister Kim Carr just shouted his entire contribution at this press conference. Bellowed. Labor's candidate for Bennelong, Jason Yat-sen Li, did not shout. He shared an aspiration to make the seat of Bennelong \"the Silicon Valley of Australia\". We are on to questions now. Does Labor have any plans to touch negative gearing? No, says Rudd. Photojournalist Mike Bowers is hot on Kevin Rudd's tail this morning in Sydney. (Good morning Mike.) Here is Rudd .. looking at things, at Macquarie University. How long before somebody does the election Tumblr? Kevin and Tony - looking at things. We've got two hot entries this morning. Kevin Rudd opens his press conference in Sydney with full disclosure. He has notes. He will use them. (This is of course a reference to \"notegate\" from last night's election debate.) Tony Abbott this morning in Melbourne has the \"bulldozers on the ground and the cranes in the sky\". Kevin Rudd in Sydney a few hours later doesn't want to be the prime minister of a country that doesn't make things. \"You can't create the jobs of the future if you don't invest in the skills of the future. We believe in building and investing in the future.\" As for that other bloke ... It's a make-off people. Richard Morris, writing in the New Statesman, gives a shout out to our slogan generator on Guardian Australia. I know a number of readers had a terrific time with this tool when we launched it several days ago. Morris: I’m sure the Guardian thinks their random political slogan generator is a harmless bit of fun inspired by Kevin Rudd’s fairly insipid campaign slogan. Let me disabuse them. I suspect many of the parties are probably flicking gently through it and writing down a few choice selections. I once sat in a room of about 20 people, where we were invited to write a memorable line to adorn the platform at conference. Entirely predictably, this process was an unmitigated disaster. After an hour of coming up with any number of lines that randomly sorted words like New, Better, Fair, Green, Future, Britain, Fresh, Together and Change into a new order, we all agreed that perhaps it would be better if we got one person to write one memorable line with a single pertinent thought. We then, ahem, \"discussed\" for another hour who should write it. (What a nightmare. Slogan by committee.) Morris: The problem is, we’ve all become fixated with \"the one great line\". And it’s all Barack Obama’s fault, with \"Change we can believe in\". In reality, not even this line stood alone. Other lines dominated the campaign, like \"Yes, we can\" and the Fairey Posters \"Hope\" and \"Change\". But since 2008, it’s become a \"mandatory\" - and an obsession - to write a great campaign line. And it takes up an inordinate amount of headspace. Morris has a suggestion for the political class: ditch the committee. Believe what you say, and say it with authenticity. Over and over. So can I make a suggestion to all the parties. If you want a great line, get a single person to write it. Then get a single person to approve it. Then spend two years and a lot of money saying it over and over again. And get someone to say it with affection, with emotion and with conviction. It’s the only way. While we are back on the debate I really did love this word cloud last night from Ben Harris-Roxas. I don't care if they are considered a bit retro, I do love a word cloud. Here's our polling guru at Guardian Australia, Simon Jackman, on the vagaries of the betting markets. I have a confession: because I'm not a betting person I always struggle to comprehend the concepts deployed by betting agencies. Last night's election debate caused a ripple on the betting markets. Sportingbet Australia say Labor's odds firmed last night. The ALP’s odds of winning next month’s election firmed from $5.75 into $5.25 at Sportingbet Australia during the course of Sunday night’s leaders’ debate. The Coalition remains a clear-cut favourite to win the September 7 election, but its odds drifted slightly from $1.14 to $1.16 at Sportingbet during the leaders’ debate. The Coalition’s odds of $1.16 represents an 81% probability of victory. In Sportingbet’s Correct Election Result market, the Coalition to win between 91 to 100 seats has been backed from $4.80 into $4.00 favouritism. The travelling party with Kevin Rudd this morning - expecting a jobs announcement shortly. I did forget to note this earlier. Kevin Rudd used last night's televised debate to promise a marriage equality bill within 100 days of taking office. The Labor leader is also using social media this morning to nudge along Labor's campaign in this space. This is a pretty obvious appeal to young voters get on that electoral roll before the cut off at 8pm this evening. Possibly unproductive to speculate that ABC24 might be having a slight lend here in this tight shot of Tony Abbott in Deakin. Suppositories and sukkas. Lovely opening to Monday, week two. I think we all need a laugh, don't we? One should always acknowledge the elders .. That's Tony Abbott, at the campaign event for Michael Sukkar. It's a shout out to Phillip Ruddock, the former Howard frontbencher, who is on the road with Abbott this morning. Abbott, somewhat unfortunately, also notes he is not .. the suppository of all wisdom .. Um. Campaign Abbott is now in the electorate of Deakin. Tangled up in blue. So Tony Abbott wants to be remembered as the infrastructure prime minister. Big roads dreaming: an Australian election campaign standard. It's hard to remember a would-be prime minister who didn't want to be the infrastructure prime minister. Every major political party has a variant on this theme. Here's another thought I want to give Politics Live readers this morning. It was also interesting to see \"hope, reward and opportunity\" make a comeback in last night's election debate. The Liberal Party has parked that slogan in recent times in favour of \"real solutions\" - its other campaign standard. You can see what these two slogans do in terms of campaign positioning can't you? One is about vision, appealing to the imagination and aspiration of voters - the other is an appeal to the verb - the doing, the governing, the delivering. There is a view inside the Liberal campaign that Abbott doesn't actually have to do the vision thing in this campaign: what is required is the verbs, not the loft and waft. The view goes like this: Abbott's strongest suit against Kevin Rudd and Labor is presenting the voters a clear line of delivery: I will do this, and I will deliver it by this time. I can be trusted to deliver these things. It's an affirmative statement by Abbott and and implied criticism of Labor and Kevin Rudd: I do what I say, they always disappoint you. They talk big and fail to deliver. They mess up, they flip flop. They stuff things up. So we've been in \"real solutions\" territory thus far in the campaign - for that reason. So it was interesting to see a bit of vision creep last night. Look yonder. The cars. They cometh. And cometh. Let's think about transport as a campaign theme for a moment or two. I thought it notable last night how many times Tony Abbott mentioned transport and infrastructure during the election debate with Kevin Rudd. Abbott was at pains to lay out the Coalition's infrastructure credentials. This morning's statement from Tony Abbott lists all the Coalition's transport projects. $6.7 billion to fix Queensland’s Bruce Highway; $1.5 billion to ensure the Westconnex project gets underway in Sydney; $1 billion to support the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane; $500 million to support the upgrade of Adelaide’s North-South Road Corridor; $400 million to upgrade the Midland Highway in Tasmania; and $5.6 billion to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway from Newcastle to the Queensland border. In addition, (the statement says), the Coalition will: work with the NSW Government to get Sydney’s F3 to M2 started by late 2014, which will mean shorter travel times, reduced congestion and safer roads for the residents of the Central Coast; complete the Perth Gateway project; get the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing underway; and build the National Broadband Network sooner and for tens of billions of dollars less than Labor’s NBN. It think we can note from all of this that the Coalition feels it necessary to reassure the voters it will invest in transport and other infrastructure. It's both positive positioning, and an attack line against Labor. It's part of a narrative Abbott is trying to build: we'll get it done - others just talk about it. Labor frames itself as the party of nation-building. Abbott is playing catch-up with a twist in this frame. Here's a bit from Tony Abbott's statement on the Melbourne transport announcement this morning. Congestion: the enemy. Abbott: A Coalition government will invest $1.5 billion to get construction underway on Melbourne’s East West Link in 2014. Melbourne is an economic powerhouse and it needs the infrastructure of the 21st century to continue to grow. The East West Link is a vital and necessary component of Melbourne’s future road network. Congestion is an increasing problem for Melbourne, which means more time spent in traffic gridlock and less time with the family or being productive. Congestion erodes people's quality of life, it makes your travel times longer and it has major economic impacts that ultimately undermine investment and job creation. The Victorian Government estimates that the cost of Melbourne’s road congestion will grow to $5 billion per annum by 2021 and $7.2 billion by 2031 – more than double current levels. The East West Link will improve productivity, decrease business costs and ease congestion. Fundamentally, the project will allow people to spend less time on congested roads and more time being productive or being with their family. Good morning all. Thanks very much to Paul Owen for keeping our fingers on the campaign pulse early. It's Katharine Murphy with you now. Tony Abbott has been inspecting roads and cars in Melbourne - shortly Kevin Rudd will inpsect the Macquarie University campus in Sydney. On his Mumble blog for the Australian, Peter Brent – who often convincingly argues against the prevailing political wisdom – predicts that “Labor will (probably) win”. He explains his reasoning: In 2013 I expect the biggest swings to the Coalition to be in the two states with ALP governments, South Australia and Tasmania. But, importantly, they’re the two with the fewest seats. Three years ago the decrepit Labor administration in NSW was a drag on the federal party’s vote, although the damage was minimised seat-wise. This week internal Labor polling is supposed to show the party ahead in Dobell, Robertson and Greenway. Leaked party polling should always be treated with caution, and the above is difficult to believe. On the other hand (in my opinion) Labor may be in with a chance in Bennelong and Gilmore. The federal Coalition’s worst bit of recent electoral luck was the 2010 change of government in Victoria. A 14 year-old state ALP administration would have come in handy this year. Queensland can be unpredictable, both at elections and in opinion polls. But again at least, from Rudd’s point of view, there is no counterpart in office to depress the vote. So the state moons are reasonably friendly for the ALP. As for the two leaders, Rudd he says, is “not the messiah” but he is competent and smart, whereas Abbott “is difficult to vote for\". I guess we'll all see in four weeks' time. Asked again about his financial estimates, he says none of the figures that have been released under this government have been reliable. We can't vouch for the starting point. All that we can vouch for is the difference that we will make. People will understand that by election day, he says. The budget bottom line will always be better under the coalition. And with that the press conference ends. Asked if there would be more debates since last night's was so boring, Abbott says: Well, I didn't think it was dull ... I've put a proposal forward for two subsequent debates. I thought we had a good debate last night. He says he thinks he and Rudd should be questioned by the public at future debates. Abbott is asked why he won't rule out raising the GST (goods and services tax) in a second term. I just think it is embarrassing that the prime minister of our company is reduced to this pathetic scare campaign ... The GST is not going to change, full stop, end of story. On his generous paid parental leave policy, he says he will have more to say on this in a few days. He is very confident that his costings on this policy \"absolutely stack up\", he says. He says he wants to under-promise and over-deliver if he is elected. Back to policy costings: Abbott says doing a lot of the detailed work is impossible from opposition, since the Coalition cannot get hold of Treasury figures. Abbott's stance towards gay marriage seems to be becoming more negative. \"I don't expect that this will necessarily come up in the next parliament,\" he says. Asked about costings for his policies, he throws it back to Rudd: \"Where are your costings?\" On gay marriage he says both sides went to the last election committed to supporting the traditional definition of marriage. Labor changed its position mid-term, but he thinks parties should not do that. This is an important issue, passionately important to people who are close to me such as my sister ... but it isn't the only issue. He says the Coalition will focus on \"bread and butter issues\" if elected. But, speaking personally, he says he does not support changing the law. I support the existing definition [of marriage]. While my sister Chris has argued with my till she's blue in the face ... I support the existing position. I pride myself on being consistent. Abbott says there is a big difference between borrowing \"to pay your day-to-day bills\" and borrowing for infrastructure. Asked about the polls, he says he says he will leave commentary on surveys to \"the Canberra insiders\". Does he think he won last night's debate? Again I'm just not going to get in to commentary. The important thing was that both of us had the chance to explain our plans ... but I'm just not sure what the prime minister's actually are, other than being relentlessly negative towards the Liberal party. Asked about \"notegate\", he says the important thing is that what Rudd had to say \"was just pretty empty\". When he looked down the barrel of the camera to address the public directly, had he practised that in the mirror? Abbott smiles. I'm not going to let you in on my trade secrets ... I'm sure you've practiced a few things yourself ... I'd obviously thought about what I wanted to say. Tony Abbott is holding a press conference in Melbourne now. He says that an incoming Coalition government will make an \"annual infrastructure statement\" to parliament. He says he wants to be known as an \"infrastructure prime minister\" He says nothing will give Australians \"a shot in the arm\" like building more roads. Kevin Rudd delighted many with his promise during last night's debate to introduce a bill legalising gay marriage within 100 days of re-election. But today the Coalition has accused him of playing politics on the issue. The prime minister said he supported legalising same-sex marriage \"as a mark of decency to same-sex couples across the country who wish the same loving, caring relationship that, for example, I have had with Therese my wife now for the last 32 years, and for that to be formalised\". He said Labor MPs would have a conscience vote on the issue and he appealed to Abbott to do the same \"because folk out there want this to happen\". Abbott said the issue was \"very important\" but said it had recently been debated by parliament and would not be a high priority for a Coalition government. It would be up to the Coalition party room to decide whether the party would get a conscience vote on the issue, he said. Today on Melbourne's Gold 104FM Abbott reiterated this position, saying: \"It's a very important issue. It's not the only issue though.\" And Mathias Cormann, one of his campaign spokespeople, said Rudd had just been \"casting around for distractions\" when he made the promise, having had nothing positive to say about jobs or the economy. He told ABC radio: Kevin Rudd is just playing politics with this. He knows that it is unlikely there would be a majority for gay marriage in the next parliament, given it has been so comprehensively defeated in this parliament. In 2012 the House of Representatives voted 98 to 42 against gay marriage, with Labor MPs allowed a free vote and the opposition voting against. At the time Anthony Albanese, now the deputy prime minister, said: \"I think at some future time our parliament will catch up with community opinion, just as it has on other issues. When marriage equality occurs, people will wonder what the fuss was about.\" Peta Credlin, Abbott’s chief of staff, has had her drink-driving case adjourned until after the election so it does not interrupt her election commitments. The case will now be heard on 10 September rather than 3 September. If you thought the Liberals' leader/reader response to \"notegate\" was a bit babyish, try this retort from Labor's David Bradbury, who said this morning that Tony Abbott didn't need notes, because all he did was spout \"three-word slogans\". Tony Abbott has weighed in on \"notegate\" (or \"notesgate\"?) – the row over Kevin Rudd using notes in last night's debate. In a hard-hitting attack, the opposition leader has called the prime minister's use of notes ... \"odd\". Abbott told Gold 104FM radio in Melbourne: I was interested to see that Mr Rudd turned up with a big wad of papers and he did seem to be reading his opening and his closing statements. It did strike me as a little odd, given that they were the rules, that he brought all those papers in. If you want to vote in the 7 September election, you have until 8pm AEST this evening to register your details with the Australian Electoral Commission. You can do this online or by dropping off a form in person at an AEC office. Despite the fact voting is required by law, the AEC fears 3 million Australians either won't vote or will cast an informal vote (spoil their ballot) this year, the AAP reports. Good morning and welcome to today’s election live blog, the morning after the first leaders’ debate of the campaign. In the Sydney Morning Herald, Peter Hartcher, one of the journalists on last night’s debate panel, said that “as an example of inspirational national vision-building, [the debate] was a failure on both sides” and noted that Coalition leader Tony Abbott effectively presented himself as stable and predictable – \"against the contrast of Labor’s chaos”. The Daily Telegraph’s lead story on the debate – headlined ”Stop the notes” – focused on accusations that Kevin Rudd had used pre-written notes, in contravention of the debate’s rules. The rule in question was the debate's final regulation of 15: The leaders may have a pen and paper on the lectern and no other documentation or props. After the debate, a spokeswoman for Rudd said there was \"absolutely no intention\" to do anything other than comply with the rules and said the PM was happy to debate with Abbott any time without notes: The PM arrived at [the] lectern in full view of the audience and the panel. There were no objections raised at any time. We have always believed this rule is aimed at preventing the use of props. The controversy led various Liberal figures last night to tweet or broadcast variations on the rhyming couplets: “Abbot looked like a leader / Rudd looked like a reader,” which I think is the first time I’ve heard reader used as an insult outside the school playground. Clearly delighted with this line, they are continuing to use it today. This morning senator Mathias Cormann told ABC radio: \"Last night Tony Abbott was looking like a leader; Kevin Rudd was looking like a reader.\" Presumably the briefing note instructing Cormann to use this quip was passed to him via a much more credible and manly medium such as word of mouth. In the Australian, Christian Kerr and Mitchell Nadin took a worm’s eye view of the debate, analysing what made the celebrated live viewer reaction tracker move from positive to negative territory and vice versa: [Abbott’s] lines on the carbon tax brought [channel Nine’s worm] down. It only really rose when he mentioned major road projects and asylum-seekers. Worse, the worm disappeared underground into negative territory when he explained his costings. Mr Rudd made a far stronger showing. His worm reared when he asked the classic \"Where's the money comment from?\" and the worm was then unimpressed when Mr Abbott trotted out his lines on Mr Rudd's record as PM the first time round. In the Australian Financial Review, Geoff Kitney wrote that “the biggest threat to the successful completion of the Rudd resurrection is the legacy of the original Rudd prime ministership and Rudd’s past was Tony Abbott’s best weapon in this first head-to-head leaders’ contest\". Not only did Abbott not stumble, he gave a very good impression of an alternative prime minister in waiting, even if a little over-schmaltzy in his concluding ‘I believe in you’ pitch to the voters. An average of three commercial television network polls taken after Sunday night's debate favoured Rudd at 51% to 49% for Abbott, the AAP reports. But a Newspoll published in today’s Australian shows the coalition on 52% to Labor’s 48% on a two-party preferred basis (ie once other parties have been stripped out). Worse for Rudd, it shows Abbott catching him up on the key question of “preferred prime minister”, with Rudd on 46% (down one from last week) and Abbott 37% (up four). That means Abbott has narrowed the gap on this question from 14 points to nine in the week since the election campaign began. A Galaxy poll for News Corp showed 48% of respondents saying the Coalition were better managers of the economy than Labor – another worrying statistic for Rudd, whose campaign is focusing on this issue. Katharine Murphy and I will have all today's news from the campaign trail here throughout the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/10/nuclear-power-station-open-thread","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-10T15:50:01Z","webTitle":"Would you live in a nuclear shadow? | Open thread","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/10/nuclear-power-station-open-thread","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/10/nuclear-power-station-open-thread","fields":{"headline":"Would you live in a nuclear shadow?","bodyText":"A new nuclear power station in Hinkley, Somerset, is a step closer to becoming reality and could be operational within nine years, according to the This is Somerset website.

Although officials conceded the polymer had made little impact so far, they will wait until Monday before deciding whether to abandon it. \"We were hoping the polymers would function like diapers, but we have yet to see a visible effect,\" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency. Officials separately has warned that the nuclear crisis could drag on for months, the first time that they have offered a timescale. Goshi Hosono, an aide to the prime minister, Naoto Kan, said everything possible was being done to contain leaks, which have contaminated the environment and food and water supplies, necessitated mass evacuations, and fomented fear as far away as Tokyo, 150 miles to the south. \"We have not escaped from a crisis situation, but it is somewhat stabilised,\" said Hosono. Asked how long it would take to bring the overheating reactors under control, he said: \"I think several months would be one target.\" The timeframe was echoed by Nishiyama, who said: \"It will take a few months until we finally get things under control and have a better idea about the future. We'll face a crucial turning point within the next few months, but that is not the end of it.\" The admission that there is no end yet in sight to the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl came after the recovery of two bodies inside the plant, staff killed when it was struck by the tsunami on 11 March. After almost three weeks of radiation, they had to be decontaminated before they could be handed to relatives. Kazhiko Kokubo, 24, and Yoshiki Terashima, 21, died from multiple head injuries, reports said. Theirs were the first confirmed deaths at the Daiichi plant. \"It pains us to have lost these two young workers, who were trying to protect the power plant during the earthquake and tsunami,\" said Tsunehisa Katsumata, the chairman of Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] The task facing 600 workers, troops and firefighters at the plant was underlined at the weekend by the discovery of a 20cm crack in a concrete pit connected to No 2 reactor. The leak generated radiation of 1,000 millisieverts an hour in the air inside the reactor, while Tepco said it could also be behind the seepage of radioactive iodine into the sea, sending contamination to 4,000 times the legal limit. Experts say that beyond the vicinity of the plant, there is minimal risk to human health in other parts of Japan or overseas. After failing to seal the crack by pouring in concrete, workers have tried to use the polymer mix to close it. Highly radioactive water has flooded the basement of the No 2 reactor and a connecting underground trench. The water in the cracked pit is thought to have come from partially melted fuel rods in the reactor's core. In their battle to cool overheated reactors and prevent a dangerous meltdown of highly radioactive fuel rods, workers have doused reactors with huge quantities of seawater. The contaminated runoff, however, has prevented technicians and engineers from getting closer to the reactors to make proper repairs. Fresh water is being pumped into No 1, 2 and 3 reactors using external power, Nishiyama said, adding that the remaining three reactors were considered stable. More than 12,000 people are known to have died in the earthquake and tsunami, while 15,472 are missing, according to police. More than 163,000 people are still living in evacuation shelters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/20/skynet-terminator","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-20T14:50:32Z","webTitle":"Skynet is about to attack.

Maybe","bodyText":"Thursday, 21 April 2011 is the day when Skynet, villainous super-computer from the Terminator films, is due to launch its assault on mankind. Terminator director James Cameron alerted the world to the significance of the date with a tweet saying: \"Instead of machines taking over, we have the very real threat of global warming.\" But hold on there James, don't downplay your own prescience. We can worry about global warming and the possibility that robots are going to kill us all. An MoD report has just this week warned that we're heading for an \"incremental and involuntary journey towards a Terminator-like reality.\" The report, the UK Approach to Unmanned Aircraft Systems, says that, given the current rate technological development, \"Britain must quickly establish a policy on what will constitute 'acceptable machine behaviour'\". Now as any good science fiction fan knows, \"acceptable machine behaviour\" has already been established in Asimov's three rules of robotics, the first of which states unambiguously: \"A robot may not injure a human being.\" The military has chosen to completely ignore Asimov's rules (understandably perhaps, given how useless pacifist robots would be in a war), but the Terminator films at least gives us some ideas on how to fight back when our drones go self-aware and turn against us (we're going to need a time machine and a robotic Arnold Schwarzenegger). If it's neither robots nor global warning that finish us off, there are plenty of other things to worry about, many of which tend to have some other ominous date attached. Between the ages of eight and 12 I was convinced that the world was going to end in 1997, after my older sister came home from school confidently stating this was the case. The prediction was something to do with Nostradamus, but I became unshakably certain that 1997 was the year mankind would blow itself up with nuclear weapons. Thus for a large part of my childhood I was sure that my later teens would be spent either dead or skulking round a barren radioactive wasteland battling giant mutated rats for the last remaining scraps of food. As 1997 passed without major incident (in my local area at any rate), there was a new apocalypse on the horizon – 31 December 1999. The millennium bug was going to see computers failing worldwide, planes falling from the sky, nuclear power stations blowing up all over the place ... but again that turned out to be a lot of fuss over nothing. Now the latest end of the world is due next year, as illustrated in the hilariously far-fetched disaster film 2012. On 21 December 2012 we reach the end point of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, which runs from 3114 BC to just before Christmas-after-next. High-profile celebrities have been drawing on the writings of interesting (if not to be taken too literally) thinkers such as Terence McKenna and Daniel Pinchbeck and coming to some alarming conclusions about what the end of the Mayan calender might represent. \"The precursors to a civilization that's going under are the same, time and time again,\" warns Mel Gibson. \"What's human sacrifice if not sending guys off to Iraq for no reason? I just wanna draw the parallels. I don't wanna be a doomsayer, but the Mayan calendar ends in 2012.\" Gibson's words are echoed by rapper Lil' Wayne – \"The world is about to end as we know it. You can see it already\" – and actor Ashton Kutcher, who recently told Men's Health magazine that his physical fitness regimen is \"completely tailored around the end of days,\" and that he stays fit \"for no other reason than to save the people I care about\". Who knows, maybe they're right. Maybe the world is about to be devastated by some calamity predicted by the Mayans 5,000 years ago. Or maybe global warming, or nuclear holocaust, or awesome killer cyborgs are set to wipe us all out. However, given how frequently the end of the world has been incorrectly forecast, it might be wise for Lil' Wayne, Mel, Ashton, and anyone else buying into the 2012 hype not to stake everything on it, just in case they're still around come 2013."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2009/feb/02/sellafield-wildcat-strike","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-02T16:09:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power workers join wildcat strike action over foreign labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/02/sellafield-wildcat-strike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/feb/02/sellafield-wildcat-strike","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power workers join wildcat strike action over foreign labour","bodyText":"The wave of wildcat strike action that has swept across the UK escalated today as hundreds more workers walked out in the protest against foreign labour. Contract workers from the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria, the Heysham nuclear power station in Lancashire and a site at Staythorpe, in Nottinghamshire, joined the unofficial action over the hiring of Italian and Portuguese workers on a Lincolnshire power station project. Workers from the Longannet power station in Scotland joined those at the Grangemouth oil refinery, who voted to continue their strike, while 200 employees at Fiddlers Ferry power station in Widnes, Cheshire, also walked out this morning. In west Wales, up to 500 contractors at the South Hook LNG gas terminal in Milford Haven downed tools for a second day. Many of the strikers took part in a similar protest on Friday. Around 150 contract workers at Aberthaw power station, in south Wales, also walked out. Outside the Lindsey oil refinery in Killingholme, Lincolnshire, where the protests began, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered for a mass meeting, voting unanimously to allow union officials to start talks with management. \"Over the last week, your heroic actions here have inspired thousands in our county, hundreds of thousands in our country, and millions across the globe,\" Kenny Ward, from the Unite union, told the crowd. \"The fight started here at Lindsey: the fight against discrimination, the fight against victimisation and the fight to put bread on your table for your children. Gordon Brown said it is indefensible. If the prime minister will not defend the working man, if parliament will not defend the working man, then the union will defend the working man.\" He said \"people in Europe\" needed to take note, and judges who interpreted the law \"to the advantage of the employer\" needed to have \"a rethink\". Gordon Brown said the unofficial strikes sweeping the country were \"counter-productive\". Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, Brown said his priority was to promote the jobs of British workers in the face of the current recession. \"I recognise people are concerned about their jobs,\" he said. The prime minister insisted the government was doing everything it could to ensure fair treatment for UK workers. The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, denied that UK firms and workers faced discrimination, and called for the unofficial strikes to stop. He said he understood the concerns of British workers but stressed that Total, which runs the Lindsey plant, had rebutted claims that UK workers had been excluded from contracts. In a statement to the House of Lords this afternoon, Mandelson said it was important to \"respect and guarantee\" the principle of free movement, which was an \"intrinsic part\" of membership of the European Union. Around 300,000 British companies operated elsewhere in the EU, he said. \"On the Lindsey site, the great majority of the workers are actually British, so clearly no policy of discrimination or exclusion of British nationals is being operated at the refinery,\" he said. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said Mandelson was \"in denial about the nature of the problem\" and the Labour party had been aware of the issue for five years. \"The facts are that the manner in which the EU 1996 Posted Workers Directive was applied into UK law in 1999 was botched,\" he said. \"The Labour party recognised this in 2004 and made a manifesto commitment to apply Article 3(8) properly into UK law. That commitment, which was repeated in 2008, has not been honoured.\" About 600 mechanical contractors met at the Sellafield site's Yottenfews car park at 7.30am to agree a 24-hour walkout in support of the Lindsey action. One of the strikers, the GMB convener Willie Doggert, said: \"All we want is a level playing field. It's not just about foreign workers. We need jobs to be advertised with transparency so that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip at getting them.\" Total said talks would be held today with the conciliation service Acas, senior union representatives and Jacobs, the main contractor at Lindsey. \"We recognise the concerns of contractors but we must stress that it has never been, and never will be, the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers. We have been a major local employer for 40 years and the majority of our 500 permanent staff are local,\" the company said. It said its £200m investment in the site would help to secure the long-term future of the refinery and local employment opportunities. A small group of protesters gathered about 100 yards from the Forest Pines hotel, near Scunthorpe, where the talks were understood to be taking place. Police were guarding both entrances to the hotel. Management at Sellafield said the contractors who walked out this morning had been building new storage facilities. A Sellafield Ltd spokesman said there were very few foreign workers employed at the site, and 90% of contractors were from west Cumbria. A similar row has been raging at Staythorpe for months and several demonstrations have been held to protest that UK workers were being overlooked in favour of foreign staff. Around 700 contractors at the Grangemouth oil refinery in central Scotland walked out again today after unofficial action on Friday. They decided they would return to work tomorrow. The wildcat action began after the Italian company IREM won a £200m construction contract and supplied its own permanent workforce. It is understood 100 Italian and Portuguese workers are already on site and 300 more are expected in the coming days and weeks. Moves are under way to set up a panel under an independent chairman to review the recruitment. Total had put a contract out to tender for the construction project with five UK firms and two European contractors. On Friday, up to 3,000 workers from at least 11 oil refineries and power plants in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland mounted protests and unofficial strikes over the contract. Mandelson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that claims that British workers had been excluded from the disputed contract, or that foreign workers were being paid less than the going rate, were unfounded. He conceded few people from Teesside took advantage of work opportunities across Europe, but denied that he was suggesting Britons should \"get on their bike\" to look for work. \"No one is forcing anyone to travel. There are other jobs being created in the UK economy. What is at stake is the opportunity for the movement of people who, if they wish, can apply for jobs or follow their companies around the European Union.\" The shadow business secretary, Kenneth Clarke, condemned the strikes. \"I understand people being worried about their jobs; I don't think this is the right way to demonstrate it,\" he said. \"The idea that people think the reaction to these concerns is to start threatening to close down power generation at the time of a cold snap is obviously something we all disapprove of.\" A spokesman for the Energy Department said: \"We're not aware of any current or potential impact of the unofficial strikes on gas, electricity or fuel supplies.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jan/21/modern-left-austria-bruno-kreisky","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-21T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"The modern left has much to learn from Austria's golden age | Neil Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/21/modern-left-austria-bruno-kreisky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/21/modern-left-austria-bruno-kreisky","fields":{"headline":"The modern left has much to learn from Austria's golden age","bodyText":"The 1970s, as I have argued before on this site, marked the high point of postwar socialism in western Europe. Across the continent in those pre-Thatcherite days, genuinely progressive statesmen set the agenda. In West Germany, there was Willy Brandt. In Sweden, Olof Palme. In Britain, Harold Wilson. But, for my money the greatest European socialist of them all was Austria's Bruno Kreisky, born exactly 100 years ago this weekend. Kreisky led his country for 13 years, from 1970-83, winning a clear majority for the Socialist party of Austria a remarkable three times. During his time in office as the first popularly elected \"red\" chancellor, he transformed Austria into one of the most egalitarian societies on earth. Kreisky promoted working-class education, extended public ownership (under his leadership Austria had one of the largest nationalised sectors outside of communist eastern Europe) and expanded the welfare state. A committed Keynesian, with a hatred of unemployment and poverty, in the 1979 election he declared that he'd rather the government run up a deficit than people lose their jobs: \"Hundreds of thousands unemployed matter more than a few billion schillings of debt.\" Under Kreisky, Austria not only became a more equal society, it also became more prosperous. His leftwing economic policies showed that there certainly was an alternative to the monetarist economics that were soon to be imposed – at huge social and economic cost – in Britain. Socially there were major advances too: the position of Austrian women was greatly improved, with maternity leave introduced, and homosexuality was decriminalised. Kreisky not only made Austria a better place, he tried his best to make the world a better place too. A true internationalist, he supported a policy of \"active neutrality\" for his country in the cold war and worked for detente with the communist countries of eastern Europe. A Jewish anti-Zionist, Kreisky was a great champion of the rights of the Palestinian people and the strongest western European critic of Israel. He was the first European leader to meet with PLO leader Yasser Arafat and in 1979 gave an official state dinner in Arafat's honour in Vienna. He was also one of the first European politicians to take an interest in developing countries, calling in the early 1960s for a new Marshall plan for the south. But it wasn't just Kreisky's policies that make him such a hero. It was his style of politics. Kreisky was a true man of the people – he kept his telephone number listed in the Vienna phone book after becoming chancellor, so that ordinary members of the public could call him to discuss their problems. Modest, humorous and immensely likeable, he debated on television without notes and said exactly what he thought. The contrast between Kreisky and the controlled, PR-obsessed politicians of today could not be greater. In the 1970s, Kreisky was involved in a furious public row with Nazi-hunter Austrian Simon Wiesenthal. This developed over the Nazi past of some of Kreisky's ministers and the Freedom party leader Friedrich Peter, Kreisky's would-be coalition partner. Kreisky defended Peter and refused to sack ministers, leading Wiesenthal to call him a \"renegade\". Kreisky, who himself had lost close relatives in the Holocaust, in turn accused Wiesenthal, a supporter of the conservative opposition People's party, of \"mafia\" methods and of trying to bring him down. Then there was Kreisky's support for nuclear power, which put him on a collision course with environmental groups. Some also criticised Kreisky for the building of the huge UNO-City complex in Vienna. But these controversies should not cloud our judgment of the man Austrians affectionately nicknamed \"Kaiser Bruno\". Kreisky's sincerity shone through in everything that he did. While a strong opponent of nazism, and indeed all forms of racism, he did not believe that people should be permanently barred from public life over bad decisions they had made in their youth. \"A member of the Nazi party or an SS-man should be able to hold any political office in Austria, unless it can be proven that he had committed a crime,\" he declared. His support for nuclear power was, as John Hodgshon has argued in the Vienna Review, \"wedded to a philosophy in which anything that translated into more jobs and industry must be good\". The UNO-City was a demonstration of Kreisky's belief in the UN and Austria's role as an actively neutral country, at the heart of solving international disputes. More than 20 years on from his death, he is still a cult figure in his country: a new poll showed that he is known to more Austrians than many members of the current governing coalition. And Austrians regard the Kreisky years as a true golden age – one where there was job security, prosperity and social harmony. When Kreisky died, his great friend Willy Brandt said that Kreisky \"performed a great service to the community and wealth of the peoples\". How Europe could do with someone like him today. If Kreisky were active in politics now, he'd be making the bankers and financial speculators pay for the mess they have caused and rejecting the new age of austerity. He'd be nationalising, not privatising, and putting the interests of the majority first. He'd be leading the opposition to Nato's war in Afghanistan and opposing any military action against Iran. Kreisky's career shows us what can be achieved if the main party of the left elects a leader who is committed, sincere and who refuses to apologise for his or her socialist beliefs. Instead, for the past 20 years, the main parties of the European left have gone in another direction. They have elected leaders – like Tony Blair – who have moved their parties away not just from socialism, but from social democracy too, and who have tamely accepted the international rule of money power. Bruno Kreisky, if he could see the Europe of 2011, would be greatly saddened at how the forces of capital have managed to destroy so many of the economic and social advances made in the postwar era, and how those advances which still remain are threatened by the new round of cutbacks. The best way we can commemorate the centenary of this remarkable and inspirational politician is to do all we can to put Kreisky-style socialism back on Europe's political agenda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/nov/10/nuclear-power-uk-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-10T11:30:00Z","webTitle":"A bright nuclear future: true or false? | Jeremy Leggett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/10/nuclear-power-uk-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/10/nuclear-power-uk-questions","fields":{"headline":"A bright nuclear future: true or false?","bodyText":"If you think the Labour government has done the right thing in its decision to expand nuclear power in the UK by 50%, see how you fare with this quiz. Are the following dozen statements true or false? 1) The independent French nuclear safety authority posts French nuclear incidents on its website, all 800-a-year of them. 2) One of the two reactors Areva is building as forerunners for the 12 that will supposedly be built in the UK, the Olkiluoto plant in Finland, has fallen far behind schedule and over budget and the French company is locked in a legal battle over the overruns with the end user, the utility company TVO. The second reactor, at Flamanville in France, is also way behind schedule. 3) The Finnish nuclear regulator has attacked Areva for fielding experts in the reactor-building programme who have a \"lack of professional knowledge\". 4) A spate of nuclear leaks has forced the French government to address public fears by ordering drilling into, and sampling, of the groundwater under all 58 French nuclear reactors. 5) This July, a heatwave shut a third of French reactors, because rivers became too hot to act as coolant. France was forced to import electricity from the UK. 6) Things got little better as winter approached. With almost one third of France's reactors out of service for maintenance and other reasons, France will have to import electricity at peak hours during the winter – for the second year running – to avoid the risk of blackouts. 7) French government ministers and officials had to cancel their visits to the flagship Cadarache nuclear facility after kilograms of plutonium dust were discovered on the site. 8) There were 1,767 leaks, breakdowns, or other safety \"events\" at British nuclear plants between 2001 and 2008. A Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) report says about half were serious enough \"to have had the potential to challenge a nuclear safety system\". 9) A radioactive leak, undiscovered for 14 months, was found at Sellafield just before a visit by the prime minister. A board of inquiry concluded the leak went unnoticed because \"managerial controls over the line were insufficient and there was inadequate inspection\". Meanwhile, elsewhere on the site two containers of highly radioactive material went missing. The operator said it was most likely that \"the anomaly lies within the accounting procedures\". 10) Sellafield Ltd has admitted its £1.8bn nuclear reprocessing plant may not be able to meet NII orders for operation, as a result of continuing technical problems. Two of the plants have been breaking down repeatedly, and the third has been closed after a rise in radiation levels. Work has started on a new £100m evaporator, but it is behind schedule, and probably won't come on stream before 2013. Germany may sue if spent fuel is not returned reprocessed. Closure of the plant would slow decommissioning of British nuclear plants, and remove much of the £70bn needed for that process, which reprocessing at Thorp was supposed to raise a good deal of, meaning another drain on the British public's taxes. 11) The NII, charged with overseeing all such problems, has an acute staff shortage. The Health and Safety Executive, for its part wants to create \"exclusions\" in its assessment of new reactor designs, in order to \"streamline\" the process. 12) Nuclear safety authorities from France, Finland and UK have asked Areva to modify its EPR reactor design. They have concerns over the \"independence principle\", and profess there is too high a degree of interactivity between the control and safety systems. All these statements are true.

And when it came to asking which story the BBC should repeat in her honour, the candidates seemed endless. Planet of the Spiders, when Sarah Jane first witnessed a regeneration, Pertwee bowing out with the seminal line, \"a tear, Sarah Jane?\" The bravehearted face-off against Davros in Genesis of the Daleks? Her eerie vulnerability in possession caper Pyramids of Mars? Instead BBC Four will repeat 1976 story The Hand of Fear tonight and tomorrow. The four-parter holds all of those qualities that made Sarah Jane, and the woman who played her, so loved: the heart, the courage and the fragility. But it is of course most notable as being her final appearance in the classic series. The Hand of Fear itself is a classic from the Hammer-inspired period, with the disembodied hand of ancient species Eldrad causing havoc in a nuclear power station, feeding off the radiation to grow back into its true form and attempting a standard enslavement attempt. But it's also among the strongest examples of its type: given the chance to film in a real nuclear plant (in 1976!), the producers could deliver expensive-looking wideshots, a world away from the wobbly sets of legend. The adventure is notable for the ridiculous Andy Pandy outfit Sarah Jane had to wear, but when she is possessed (as happens rather often), the childish costume, coupled with a dead-eyed Sladen camping it up, declaring that \"Eldrad must live!\", means her porcelain face is every bit the killer dolly. It's vintage Sarah Jane. It seems crazy now, but the original plan had been to kill Sarah Jane off, perhaps as a marker of how iconic the character had become. It was testament to how much affection had developed for Sladen that her request for that not to happen was met. It wouldn't be fair on the younger children, she reasoned. Neither did she want to be married off, as had happened to her predecessor, Katy Manning's Jo Grant. This wouldn't be true to the character, she figured, and her unspoken feelings for the Doctor. So Sarah Jane's exit feels low-key, but no less powerful. It's a common criticism of old Doctor Who that the female characters are underwritten tropes who come and go like carousel horses. The worst thing you could say about Sarah Jane's exit is it maybe feels a little tacked on compared to the epic story arcs that greet companions nowadays. But Baker and Sladen rewrote the scripts themselves to deliver something fitting. Cold from the ice planet, grumpy at being possessed once too often, an exasperated Sarah declares that: \"I'm going to pack up my goodies and go home!\" Exasperated that the Doctor doesn't appear to be listening, bungling under the console, she storms off and does just that, demanding to return to south Croydon. While she's off packing her goodies, the Doctor receives a summons to Gallifrey from the Time Lords, and \"realises\" that he cannot take a human to his home planet and Sarah must indeed depart. In many ways he's behaving appallingly. The audience didn't know at this point whether he was telling the truth (he never cared much for Time Lord custom in the past), or whether he had realised that he'd denied this woman a normal life for too long, and was breaking his own heart to do the right thing. As the domestic turns serious, Sarah's face cracks, she claims she was only joking to get a rise, but they both know it's over. As ever with this extraordinary friendship, it's about what isn't said. They part with some platitudes about how \"travel really does broaden the mind,\" and she scuttles off whistling, not imagining for a minute that she won't see him again for 30 years. A little sad, but striding off into the future whistling. This was Sarah Jane Smith. We discovered the true emotional cost of what happened to Sarah, of the Doctor's alien misunderstanding of human emotion, when they were reunited in 2006, Sarah having been unable to ever truly move on. We also discovered that rather than south Croydon, he'd actually left her in Aberdeen. Sarah Jane's story eventually got its happy ending. For Elisabeth Sladen's rather mournful one, I can't think of a more suitable tribute. • Doctor Who: Hand of Fear, will be on BBC4 at 7.40 and 8.05pm on Monday 9 May, and again on Tuesday 10 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/feb/03/pakistan-nuclear-bombs-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-03T00:05:05Z","webTitle":"Storing up trouble: Pakistan's nuclear bombs | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/03/pakistan-nuclear-bombs-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/03/pakistan-nuclear-bombs-editorial","fields":{"headline":"Storing up trouble: Pakistan's nuclear bombs","bodyText":"Why does Pakistan keep heaping up nuclear weapons like a woodcutter piling logs? American intelligence assessments now estimate that Pakistan has over 100 weapons, more than India, and at least twice as many as it had only four years ago. It is even suggested that Pakistan could quite soon overtake Britain as the world's fifth largest nuclear power. Pakistan has come a long and dismal way since Zulfikar Ali Bhutto reportedly vowed in 1972 that \"even if we have to eat grass we will make nuclear bombs\". Mr Bhutto went to the scaffold before Pakistan got its first bomb in 1987. But the programme, for a long time under the direction of Dr AQ Khan, later notorious for his role in the proliferation of nuclear technology, has forged inexorably on, under leader after leader, including Mr Bhutto's daughter, Benazir. The fate of many of these leaders – Mr Bhutto hanged, President Zia-ul-Haq and Benazir assassinated, President Pervez Musharraf pushed out of power – constitutes in itself a commentary on why Pakistan would be better off without such weapons. In a country so volatile, where the principle of civilian and even of military control of nuclear weapons must be an issue, why take these risks? Or, if a sense that they are vital to Pakistan's prestige and necessary to deter India prevents a reversal of policy, why not stop at a much lower number? Those living in \"established\" nuclear states need to watch themselves when they embark on criticism of those who came later. Yet it is surely permissible to point out that nuclear weapons are not in any way a store of value. They are a store of trouble, as the established nuclear powers have recognised, admittedly tardily and incompletely, by reducing their inventories in recent years. Since the conflict between India and Pakistan acquired a full nuclear dimension in 1998, it can be argued that strategic stability in the subcontinent has weakened. War between India and Pakistan nevertheless remains a very remote prospect. The Indians, like others, see the greater dangers as the security of the weapons themselves and of the facilities producing nuclear materials. The Americans are particularly anxious about the latter. What is called \"slow theft\", the squirrelling away of small amounts of nuclear material by insiders to pass to terrorists, is said to be a cause of deep anxiety among officials who monitor the situation. The internal difficulties of Pakistan, with the Afghan war on its doorstep, a serious insurgency on its own soil, and extremist movements of various kinds barely under control, mean that such fears cannot be dismissed. Cocking a nuclear snook at India seems worse than irresponsible under the circumstances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/28/japan-fukushima-nuclear-reactors-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-28T19:16:28Z","webTitle":"Fukushima engineers hampered by lack of power in fight to cool reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/japan-fukushima-nuclear-reactors-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/28/japan-fukushima-nuclear-reactors-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima engineers hampered by lack of power in fight to cool reactors","bodyText":"The central problem behind almost every hurdle faced by the workers at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has been – and remains – a lack of power supply. Since electricity was knocked out by the tsunami it has been impossible to run the pumps that cool the reactor cores and circulate water around storage pools used to keep spent fuel rods cold. Last week engineers succeeded in connecting power to some of the reactors, but three remain in a dangerous and precarious state. The fuel rods inside reactors one, two and three are at least partially exposed but should be covered by water at all times to prevent a meltdown. The fuel in all three reactors is believed to have melted to some degree. This week engineers began pumping fresh water into the reactors amid fears that the previous tactic – to flood them with seawater and vent off steam – was leading to a build-up of salt deposits that could block the coolant pipes. Spent fuel rods in the storage pools are another serious concern. The Japanese authorities do not know the condition of 2,724 waste fuel rods kept in ponds in the top levels of reactor buildings one to four and there are concerns that the pool at building four boiled dry. The rods pose a potentially greater threat than the overheating reactors, because they could catch fire and release radiation directly into the air. The pool at reactor four has been stacked beyond its original design capacity and there is a slim chance that damage to the rods could restart nuclear reactions, producing enormous amounts of radiation. The Japanese authorities have gathered all the water-pumping equipment they can muster, from military trucks to fire engines and concrete pumping apparatus, to keep the storage pools filled with water, but without external power there can be no let-up in dousing the rods. \"If you take a fuel rod bundle out of a reactor and put it in a pool, you have to leave it for five years before you can take it out. They don't produce a lot of heat, but it is unrelenting,\" said Richard Lahey, who was General Electric's head of safety research for boiling water reactors when the company installed them at Fukushima. The latest setback engineers face is the discovery of highly radioactive water in and around the turbine building at reactor two. Radiation detectors measured the level at 1,000 millisieverts per hour and as workers are allowed an exposure of 250 millisieverts a year, raised from 100 millisieverts before the crisis, they could only be in the contaminated area for 15 minutes before reaching the maximum dose. Engineers cannot resume work on connecting the power to reactor two until they have drained the water pools and scrubbed the area clean, an effort now underway. Officials at Tepco, who run the plant, say it is not clear where the radioactive water came from, but it escaped from the reactor core, either directly through a breach in the containment vessel or through a crack or hole in pipework. Lahey believes that molten fuel inside reactor two has begun to leak out of its containment vessel, meaning it may be too late to save that reactor. The troubles on site are compounded by fears that radioactive material, including plutonium, is leaching into the soil and has washed into the sea. So far, these problems are localised: most radioactive material leaked onto land will bind to soil and stay there, while radioactive material in the sea will be diluted and disperse. \"They are doing all the right things now, but this is a tight horse race,\" Lahey said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/13/japan-no-time-mourn-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-12T23:05:08Z","webTitle":"Japan: No time to mourn | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/13/japan-no-time-mourn-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/13/japan-no-time-mourn-editorial","fields":{"headline":"Japan: No time to mourn","bodyText":"Japan has been shaken by more than 400 strong aftershocks since the earthquake and tsunami hit a month ago. Hard on the heels of a collective silent prayer on Monday to mourn the loss of an estimated 28,000 people, there was another shock: the decision to put the damage to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors on a par with the explosion at Chernobyl. This is not only an admission that the amount of radiation released is of a new order of magnitude (although it is still only a 10th of that form the Soviet accident). It is also a marker for the future. It could take Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) months to get the stricken reactors and spent-fuel-rod pools under control, and as radiation continues to leak, the total amount could, it is feared, exceed the levels of the 1986 disaster. Has the pendulum been made to swing too far the other way, by the very people who dismissed comparisons with Chernobyl only weeks ago? In many ways, Fukushima bears little comparison to the world's worst nuclear accident. The explosion and fire at Chernobyl sent parts of the reactor core high into the atmosphere in a plume that drifted over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and western Europe. The contamination around Fukushima could potentially spell a terminal blow for the communities around it, as we report today, but those communities lie within 25 miles of the plant and the area affected is still local. The equivalent vehicle for the dispersal of radiation from Fukushima is water rather than air, in this case a rather large quantity of it – the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, the particles are being carried by a strong current away from population centres, dispersing and diluting them. There are unknowns in this too, such as the degree to which radioactivity will become concentrated in the food chain. But in terms of its geographical reach, Fukushima is still, thankfully, a long way behind Chernobyl. Both disasters have however this in common: weeks after they happened, the experts are no nearer dealing with the root of the problem. They have stopped pumping low-level radioactive water from the buildings into the sea, but they are no closer to restoring the plant's cooling system. And there is potentially three times as much material to contain in Fukushima as there was in Chernobyl. That is the problem of assessing the risk of living with nuclear power. Other industries, such as coal extraction, have incomparably higher death tolls and many more accidents. The risks of a nuclear accident are small in comparison. But when one of them happens, it does so big time. It may take more than just one speech by the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to persuade Japan that the worst is now over, that the situation at the plant is stabilising, and that people should now concentrate on reconstructing the areas devastated by the tsunami. Formidable problems still remain, such as the 150,000 people still living in emergency shelters – a number that could nearly double if the 130,000 living between 20 and 30 kilometres from the plant have to leave their homes too. Anger at the ever changing assessments of the radiation dangers and advice has so far been directed at Tepco. The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, was so upset he refused to meet Tepco's president, who had travelled to the area to apologise. The Japanese have responded to the worst disaster to befall them in modern times stoically – some, such as the workers who volunteered to stay in the stricken plant, heroically. It has been a month from hell for people who have had little time to mourn the loss of their families and their homes, let alone devise new lives for themselves. But their test has only just begun, as the impact on the economy starts to show through. It could be that the nation finds heart and fresh purpose in the reconstruction, but it will take massive amounts of will and discipline to ensure that it does."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/jun/14/nuclear-plant-life-extension-savings","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-14T16:49:12Z","webTitle":"Magnox reactors could see closure deferred to help bridge funding gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/14/nuclear-plant-life-extension-savings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jun/14/nuclear-plant-life-extension-savings","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear reactors could see closure deferred to help bridge funding gap","bodyText":"Plans are under way to extend the life of the UK's oldest nuclear reactors, which would ease the government's need to find an extra £4bn for clean-up funding, the Guardian has learned. The Wylfa reactor on Anglesey, due to close at the end of the year, would remain open until at least 2012 if safety regulators agree. The extra electricity generated by the reactor, which began operations in 1971, would earn its parent, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), up to an extra £500m in revenue. EnergySolutions, the US company which operates the old Magnox reactor sites for the NDA, is also looking for a further life extension of the Oldbury reactor. It is the UK's oldest operating nuclear plant, opened in 1968, and recently regulators gave it approval to remain open until mid 2011. EnergySolutions is preparing to begin work on another extension soon. The company has already prepared detailed technical assessments to support a life extension for Wylfa. The NDA will review these before submitting the plans to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive, which will make a final decision in the next few months. Mark Morant, president of EnergySolutions' international group, said: \"The life extension at Oldbury underscores the reliability and durability of the Magnox reactors. As well as generating more carbon-free electricity for the UK, the extension brings valuable new revenue for the government and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. We are hopeful that there may also be more to come from Oldbury. \"On Wylfa, we cannot pre-empt any decision to be taken by the regulatory authorities and safety considerations are paramount, but we at EnergySolutions are anxious to do all we can to help support the NDA's ongoing clean-up of the UK's nuclear legacy.\" The NDA said that Wylfa and Oldbury were performing well, and pointed to figures which showed that last year they generated the most electricity in their history. The NDA is responsible for decommissioning the UK's old reactors, which it estimates will cost £73bn. It is supposed to fund about half its annual clean-up budget through its commercial activities, such as operating the remaining Magnox reactors and reprocessing spent fuel. The rest is paid for by the taxpayer, via the energy department. But lower electricity prices because of the recession and the closure of its Thorp reprocessing plant has dented its income while decommissioning costs have increased. Funding the NDA now takes up two thirds of the energy department's annual budget. New energy secretary Chris Huhne told the Guardian this month that his department faces a £4bn funding gap by 2015 as a result, which means other programmes could face the axe. \"The costs are such that my department is not so much the Department of Energy and Climate Change as the Department of Nuclear Legacy and Bits of Other Things,\" he told the Guardian. The funding hole is equivalent to one sixth of the money saved by the overall cuts in public spending identified by the Treasury earlier this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2011/feb/28/cutsandclosures-public-sector-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-28T12:40:46Z","webTitle":"Challenging the cuts: A guide to judicial review | Adam Wagner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/28/cutsandclosures-public-sector-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2011/feb/28/cutsandclosures-public-sector-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Challenging the cuts: A guide to judicial review","bodyText":"The coalition government wants to reduce the national deficit by billions, but is facing regular court challenges against its decisions to cut budgets. Some have been successful, such as the challenge to the cancellation of a school building programme and to London Councils' decision to cut the London boroughs' grants scheme budget — and there are more to come. It is important to understand the basis on which individuals can challenge decisions that affect them, why unelected judges have the power to alter decisions of elected officials, and how public authorities can avoid being vulnerable to successful challenges in future. The key is accountability. Decisions of public authorities can be challenged in the courts by way of \"judicial review\": a process by which legislative and executive decisions are reviewed by judges to ensure that they are lawful. The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that public authorities don't go beyond the powers given to them by parliament and that they don't abuse those powers. In the past courts have often proved deferential for fear of breaching the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. But judges have more recently been active in holding government to account, and have sought to protect fundamental rights in a number of key judgments. Judicial powers were bolstered by the introduction of the Human Rights Act in 2000, which prohibits public authorities from breaching fundamental rights. If you are looking to challenge a decision, there are some legal hurdles to overcome. The decision must have been made by a public authority – this is not always obvious, for example, the justice ministry is a public authority, but the Football Association is not. In addition, you must have \"standing\"; that is, you must have sufficient interest in the decision – so an individual could challenge a decision to close a local library which she often uses. Sometimes pressure groups can get involved, too, for example, Greenpeace was allowed to challenge a decision relating to a nuclear power station as it had members living in the area. Finally, decisions have to be challenged promptly and certainly within three months. This rule is strictly enforced as it is seen as necessary to allow public authorities to carry out their functions without ongoing fear of litigation. Once a review is under way, there are three main grounds on which a decision can be challenged. • First, on the basis that it was illegal – this usually means that the decision maker has acted beyond the powers granted to it by parliament, or has misunderstood the law. • Second, because it was irrational – this is difficult to establish, it is not enough to show that a decision was unreasonable, it must be so outrageous that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question could have arrived at it; a decision could also be disproportionate to the end sought, usually in the context of human rights or European Community law. • Third, the decision may have been procedurally unfair – a common example is when decision makers fail to carry out an adequate public consultation, as was the case in relation to the Building Schools for the Future decision. If a decision is successfully challenged (pdf), a court will usually quash it, which makes it void and unenforceable. It can also force an authority to remake the decision, even if that means making the same decision, or prohibit an authority from acting in a particular way. Damages are sometimes available, too.

This is despite ministers' claims the industry would no longer receive any public subsidy – repeated today by energy secretary Chris Huhne as he unveiled the next step in the UK's new nuclear reactor programme. The government has been consulting with nuclear operators about how they will pay their waste disposal costs. But the response by the Ministry of Defence, which has a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines so must also pay a disposal levy, said the proposals favoured private reactor companies and could encourage a \"'someone else's problem' attitude\". The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the partially state-funded body responsible for cleaning up the UK's publically owned civil nuclear sites, also said the levy could underestimate the disposal costs, leaving the taxpayer to cover any shortfall. The NDA said such a levy could inadvertently lead to a \"futures market\" where nuclear reactor companies trade radioactive waste like a commodity. Industry experts said that if the government underestimated the costs, companies could buy options to store the waste from planned reactors if they believed the disposal levy would increase in the future. Highly radioactive waste from the UK's old reactors and nuclear weapons programmes is currently dotted around the country in interim storage facilities. The cost of disposing of this will be met by the taxpayer via the MoD and the NDA. The plan is to eventually build a £12bn underground repository to store this waste permanently. This repository could also house waste from new civil nuclear power stations. The industry will only invest in new reactors if the government fixes a disposal levy to cover their contribution towards disposal in such a repository. The taxpayer will be liable for any shortfall if the actual costs exceed this levy decades from now. Today, the government outlined how companies would have to pay for decommissioning costs but will not announce how they will contribute towards a new repository until later this autumn. Jean McSorley, a Greenpeace consultant, said: \"The NDA's document reveals there is a substantial risk of underestimating the cost of disposing of waste from new reactors. Any shortfall would have to be paid by the taxpayer, resulting in a significant subsidy to the nuclear industry. The government has to stick to its promise of no more subsidies for new reactors and must act to close any loopholes in the proposed funding arrangements.\" The \"fixed unit price\" (FUP) levy proposed by the government charges operators on the amount of electricity they generate, rather than the volume of waste they produce. The MoD's submission said this would favour reactor companies which typically produce more waste for the electricity they generate than the UK's fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. \"The current proposal aimed at removing uncertainty could encourage perverse behaviour, poor technical choices, short-term thinking and a 'someone else's problem' attitude,\" its submission said. The NDA said its response to the consultation on the disposal levy was \"very positive in tone\" and supported the idea of delaying the setting of the FUP until more was known about the future costs. \"It is in this context that our author raised the possibility of operators being given an 'asset' if, over time, the FUP turns out to be an underestimate. This is not a scenario we believe to be likely.\" A government spokesman said: \"We are keen to ensure that operators of new nuclear power stations meet in full their waste management, waste disposal and decommissioning costs.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/19/trident-mod-renewal-security","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-19T13:30:01Z","webTitle":"Time to move beyond Trident | Nick Ritchie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/19/trident-mod-renewal-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/19/trident-mod-renewal-security","fields":{"headline":"Time to move beyond Trident","bodyText":"The government has once again demonstrated the continued failure of the defence establishment to move beyond a cold war mindset. Instead of transforming its understanding of global security to meet the realities of a complex, interconnected world of messy security challenges, it has announced the next phase of the controversial programme to replace the current Trident nuclear weapons system. This \"initial gate\" decision, originally scheduled for September 2009, has been much delayed because of concerns about the safety of the UK's current submarine nuclear power reactor design. The hold-up has now been resolved – in favour of a new reactor design that will be more expensive and rely on US assistance, further eroding the veneer of independence religiously asserted in Whitehall. And what of the cost? In 2006 the government's cost estimates at 2006/07 prices for replacing the Trident system (including submarines, warheads, infrastructure and missiles) were between £15-20bn, although the ministry of defence's permanent under-secretary at the time, Sir Bill Jeffrey, later stated in November 2008 that these were only \"ballpark estimates\". The new initial gate report insists this estimate remains robust. Others argue that the MoD has struggled to bring in major equipment projects on time and to budget, and suggest a procurement figure closer to £30-£35bn, not including annual operating costs. The MoD will foot the bill for this white elephant, as George Osborne made abundantly clear last July. This comes at a time when the MoD is trying to deal with a major funding shortfall in its future equipment budget of up to £36bn over the next 10 years, its budget is being cut by 7.5% over the current parliament after the 2010 comprehensive spending review, and it has gone through three rounds of major cutbacks and delays in December 2008, December 2009 and last October's painful strategic defence and security review. But this still isn't enough: the MoD is currently undertaking a new three-month study, reporting in July, to consider how more personnel and equipment programmes could be axed to save several more billion. In 2006, Tony Blair stated explicitly that the Trident replacement programme would \"not be at the expense of the conventional capabilities that our armed forces need\". That promise was greeted with some scepticism at the time and it is now clear that it simply cannot be kept. The first \"concept\" phase of the Trident replacement programme has already consumed almost £1bn. The next \"assessment\" phase authorised by the initial gate decision will consume a further £3bn over the next five years. By 2016, when contracts are tendered and the programme becomes to all intents irreversible (the \"main gate\" decision), approximately 15% of total programme cost will have been spent, including more than £500m for long lead items for the submarine hulls, reactor and propulsion systems, and combat systems. Where have the Liberal Democrats been in all this? They previously accepted that the \"like-for-like\" replacement being pursued by the Conservatives is strategically and economically unsound and explored some of the issues around alternatives in an April 2010 policy document. Last year's coalition agreement stated that: \"We will maintain Britain's nuclear deterrent, and have agreed that the renewal of Trident should be scrutinised to ensure value for money. Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for alternatives.\" A year on and the Liberal Democrats have provided little by way of substantive alternative options. Perhaps their chance has finally come with the announcement of a study into alternative nuclear options. As a self-styled \"progressive\" nuclear weapon state the UK can and should do more to seriously examine options that push the role of nuclear weapons in national security policy further into the background, further reduce the UK's nuclear stockpile, support the Obama administration's determination to make progress towards a world free of nuclear weapons, and reduce the cost of maintaining a nuclear arsenal. This, above all, requires rethinking current nuclear weapons policy, not least the outdated need for a nuclear-armed submarine continuously at sea to deter a \"bolt from the blue\" nuclear attack. The Liberal Democrats should use their position to leverage the resources of government to conduct detailed studies of alternatives unconstrained by the Conservatives' definition of what counts as a \"minimum\" nuclear deterrent and what does not. As the government insists on pushing ahead with a \"like-for-like\" Trident replacement programme it is getting more and more difficult to see how a nuclear weapons capability can make a significant contribution to our security in an increasingly complex international security environment filled with messy conflicts for which nuclear deterrent threats are irrelevant. When the government's choice comes at the expense of conventional capabilities more suited to our security needs, the wisdom of staying in the nuclear weapons business becomes even more questionable. It is time to rethink our reflexive attachment to nuclear status and the myths of nuclear security before the bills truly pile up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/11/japan-earthquake-prompts-tsunami-warnings","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-11T10:32:43Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake prompts tsunami warnings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/japan-earthquake-prompts-tsunami-warnings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/11/japan-earthquake-prompts-tsunami-warnings","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake prompts tsunami warnings","bodyText":"Japan temporarily issued tsunami warnings for parts of the north-east coast on Monday following a powerful aftershock exactly a month after a magnitude-9 earthquake created huge waves that killed an estimated 28,000 people. NHK, the public broadcaster, warned of a tsunami up to 2 metres high on the coast of Ibaraki prefecture after the magnitude-7.1 quake. Although the waves were estimated to be much smaller than those that devastated Japan's north-east coast on 11 March, the meteorological agency warned people in Ibaraki to evacuate to higher ground. The warnings were later lifted. The aftershock came as the government announced it was widening the evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant due to high levels of accumulated radiation and rising fears about the long-term effects on residents' health. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the current 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone would be extended to five other communities, including the village of Iitate, which lies 25 miles from the plant. The village's 5,000 residents were told to prepare to leave their homes, although the evacuation would not take place immediately as radiation levels presented no immediate threat to health. The Asahi newspaper said the zone would be widened to 19 miles in some areas, depending on wind direction, adding that residents would be given about a week to prepare. \"We have made a new decision about evacuations based on data analysis of accumulated radiation exposure information,\" Edano told a news conference. \"There is no need to evacuate immediately.\" About 70,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima Daiichi have already been evacuated, and another 130,000 living inside a band 12 to 19 miles away have been told to leave voluntarily or remain indoors due to disruption to supply lines and services. Engineers at the plant say that although progress has been made in containing radioactive water that has built up beneath reactors, they are still no closer to restoring damaged cooling systems. Until repairs are made they cannot cool overheated fuel rods that could cause a major leak of radiation if they go into full meltdown. The government had ignored pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency and environmental groups to widen the evacuation zone. The US has advised its citizens not to go within 50 miles of the plant. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency, apologised for the anxiety caused by radiation leaks, and warned that the cooling systems could take months to repair. \"It's still difficult to give a timeline regarding when we can resolve the problem,\" Nishiyama said. \"We are very sorry for the evacuees who are anxious to see the problem resolved.\" The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, criticised the decision first to ask people in the area to stay indoors, then to consider leaving and now to prepare for evacuation. \"Residents are very confused about what to do,\" he said. Earlier, Sato refused to meet the president of the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, Masataka Shimizu, who had travelled to Fukushima to apologise to the prefecture's people. The tsunami warning was a reminder of the events of a month ago, which were marked across the country by a moment's silence at 2.46pm. More than 14,000 people are still missing, and 152,000 survivors are living in evacuation centres. Reflecting on the damage to his prefecture, which is also at the centre of the nuclear power crisis, Sato said: \"My chest has been ripped open by the suffering and pain that this disaster has caused the people of our prefecture. I can't find the words to express my sorrow.\" The prime minister, Naoto Kan, placed a message in newspapers in several countries, including Britain, China and the United States, thanking the international community for its support. Kan said the generosity shown towards Japan in its time of need demonstrated the human capacity for kizuna, or bonds of friendship, and vowed that Japan would emerge a stronger nation. \"We deeply appreciate the kizuna our friends from around the world have shown and I want to thank every nation, entity, and you personally, from the bottom of my heart,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/19/japan-heroic-earthquake-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-19T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Japan shows us the heroic in the everyday | Sarah Ditum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/19/japan-heroic-earthquake-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/19/japan-heroic-earthquake-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Japan shows us the heroic in the everyday","bodyText":"One of the workers inside the Fukushima nuclear power station has reportedly sent a message to his family. It says: \"Live well. I cannot be home for a while.\" The \"Fukushima 50\" are, by any definition, heroic – risking their lives to protect others. And in the middle of a greater work than most of us will (hopefully) be called on to do, this man is thinking about home. That feels poignant. Bathetic, even. After all, we usually think of heroism as being distinct from normality, as extraordinary. We do the same when we decide what is valuable in our culture, often picking out the rare and remarkable as the most precious, to looking to symphonies, great paintings or magnificent buildings as evidence of the excellence of our species. But when absolute disaster comes, it is made abruptly clear how much more the banal and the homely can matter than any of these totems to cultural greatness. The images of ruined domesticity are the most painfully affecting: family photos covered in filth and separated from the people they belong to, the mystifying appearance of a man with a bike in the middle of collapsed streets, the awful incongruity of a stained Miffy toy sitting among rubble and trash. The cynical response to these pictures would be to say that they show us how puny human lives are. Even if the owners are still alive, can they care about such detritus in a time of mass tragedy? We are a fragile species, obsessed with ephemera, these stills seem to whisper. It's comforting to tell ourselves that what's been lost was trivial anyway – but terribly wrong. This explosion of peoples' daily lives into the open shows us what our existence is actually made up of – not the dramatic and unusual, but the boring, the things that are as unremarkable and essential as air and water. (Speaking of which, images of people queueing to fill plastic bottles from pumps ought to tell us that a functioning water system is a more impressive feat of construction that any of the ancient follies people travel thousands of miles to gawk at.) Imagine seeing some high-culture totem surrounded by destruction – Jeff Koons's rabbit, say, instead of Dick Bruna's. The effect would be more funny than tragic. A museum piece can be distantly appreciated by millions, but a toy is a part of a life, and insists that we imagine the child and the family who left it behind. Because I think the rarely acknowledged truth is that the extraordinary is overrated. The really astonishing work of humanity is the daily act of getting on, and most acts of superhuman courage or bravery are like that of the worker I heard quoted on the radio this week – not done with the intention of achieving glory, but in the service of maintaining ordinary life. This feels like the point at which I should call for everyone to stop taking everyday things for granted. Maybe I could instil a little guilt in everyone reading this for being a have when the world is filled with devastated have-nots. Actually, I don't want to do anything of the sort. Certainly, most of our lives could feel warmer, and maybe a bit less wasteful, if we learned a little more affection for the dull stuff – I'm thinking of projects like Karen magazine (tagline: \"made out of the ordinary\"), which takes everyday, unglamorous things like hospital visits and dentists as its subject and makes them lyrical. But ultimately, we should be able to take everyday things for granted – better that than living in constant anticipation of having our lives swept away. The chance to be comfortably bored is one of the highest achievements of humanity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/06/chamber-commerce-apple-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-06T10:44:48Z","webTitle":"Apple joins  Chamber of Commerce exodus over climate change scepticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/06/chamber-commerce-apple-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/06/chamber-commerce-apple-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Apple joins Chamber of Commerce exodus over climate change scepticism","bodyText":"Apple has become the latest in a growing list of companies to quit the US Chamber of Commerce over its policies on climate change. In a letter to the chamber president, Thomas Donohue, Apple's Catherine Novelli said she was frustrated by the hard-line stance the organisation had taken against the Environmental Protection Agency and draft climate legislation now before the Senate. Novelli did not sugarcoat the exit. \"We strongly object to the chamber's recent comments opposing the EPA's effort to limit greenhouse gases,\" she wrote in the letter, released yesterday, adding: \"Apple supports regulating greenhouse gas emissions, and it is frustrating to find the chamber at odds with us in this effort.\" The company's departure is effective immediately. The chamber is against the idea that the EPA should use its authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. This is almost universally seen as a fallback position in case the Democrats fail to push a climate change bill through Congress. The chamber also opposes the climate bill passed by the house last June, claiming it will drive up business costs. Some chamber officials have stirred things up further by calling for a commission to put the science of climate change \"on trial\" – even though the most authoritative report to date on the impact of climate change on different regions in the US was released just weeks ago. Those comments may turn out to be the ones that started the (as yet) mini-exodus. Within the last two weeks, the chamber has lost California's biggest utility corporations, Pacific Gas and Electric and Exelon, along with PNM resources, a New Mexico firm. Nike resigned from the commerce executive but remains a member. Two other firms - General Electric and Johnson &amp; Johnson - have issued statements saying that they disagree with the chamber's climate policy. The defection of these household names has inevitably attracted attention. So, too, has the spread of business exiting the chamber, from conventional utility companies to ultra-innovative firms such as Apple. Some see the moves as the beginnings of a new climate change consensus in the business world, but it will take many more defections before a critical mass is reached. The chamber estimates its membership at 3m \"businesses and organizations of every size\" and, on its official website at least, shows no sign of feeling even the faintest pinch of loss. Instead, it claims to be protecting its members by using funds to attack the climate change bill and its supporters. Environmental organisations say the defections are the beginning of the end for the chamber. \"It just underscores how out of touch the chamber position on this issue is with mainstream America.\" said Josh Dorner, a spokesman for Clean Energy Works. \"The chamber has effectively written itself out of mainstream debate.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2011/jul/08/british-gas-raises-gas-electricity-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-08T10:07:15Z","webTitle":"British Gas raises gas and electricity prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jul/08/british-gas-raises-gas-electricity-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2011/jul/08/british-gas-raises-gas-electricity-prices","fields":{"headline":"British Gas raises gas and electricity prices","bodyText":"British Gas has stunned households across the UK by announcing a rise in gas and electricity prices of 18% and 16%, just eight months after it raised its prices by 7%. The increase, which will affect 9 million customers and be effective from 18 August, provoked energy minister Chris Huhne to today demand change in the UK electricity market. At a time when households are struggling with soaring food bills amid persistently high inflation, the price rise will add £192 to the average annual dual fuel bill, which will increase from £1,096 to £1,288 as a result. Mike O'Connor, chief executive of Consumer Focus, said: \"This price rise will send a shock wave across the country. The impact on customers will be severe, piling more pressure on severely stretched household budgets and pushing hundreds of thousands more households into fuel poverty.\" The news comes on the same day Scottish &amp; Southern Energy (SSE) announced it is suspending all its doorstep sales activity in Great Britain with immediate effect, leading to 900 job losses. Two months ago the utility giant was found guilty of misleading potential customers when doorstepping them in a bid to get them to switch gas and electricity supplier, following a successful prosecution by trading standards. SSE said commission-based doorstep selling is \"no longer an effective way to gain customers for the long term\", because consumer confidence in the way companies sell on doorsteps, and the way in which salespeople are remunerated, is low. It also said it was closing its doorstep sales arm because the sales process \"rightly requires increasingly significant customer safeguards\". Alistair Phillips-Davies of SSE said: \"The world has moved on. We understand that fewer people are willing to engage with traditional doorstep sellers.\" Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?, welcomed SSE's move: \"Very few people think energy suppliers are trustworthy, so it's good news that SSE is listening to consumers and trying to restore its reputation. As energy suppliers consider their policies on doorstep selling, it is important they don't simply shift their efforts to other forms of cold calling. \"We found that almost half (44%) of people have been phoned by an energy company in the past 12 months, and six in 10 felt pressured to switch, so suppliers should be focusing on better value products and customer service, rather than hard selling.\" 'Unwelcome but unsurprising announcement' British Gas last increased its prices in December by 6.9% (or £43) for gas and 6.7% (£28) for electricity. In total, within a year its customers will have seen their bills rise by £258 or 25%. This compares with the £239 or 21% increase seen by Scottish Power customers last month. British Gas blamed steep rises in wholesale costs, which have increased 30% since last winter because of a higher global demand for gas, driven by increased consumption in Asia and the impact on supply of unrest in the Middle East and north Africa. It said customers could benefit from free loft and wall cavity insulation, free energy use monitoring, and flexible payment terms. British Gas managing director Phil Bentley said: \"We know there is never a good time to raise prices, but we are buying in a global energy market and have to pay the market rate.\" But consumer groups were outraged. Which?'s Lloyd said: \"This is an unwelcome but unsurprising announcement for British Gas's millions of customers. Many people are already having to cut back on essentials because of the rising cost of living, and with energy bills rising further this could be a cold winter for many.\" Ann Robinson of uSwitch.com said there was a danger the move could lead the remaining four major suppliers to follow suit with price increases – the first round of rises which ended in March hit almost 28 million customers and added £630m on to household energy bills. Robinson said: \"The impact on family budgets will be huge, but it will be particularly hard on those living on fixed incomes, and I would urge both suppliers and the government to start thinking now of how they can provide some support. \"It may seem a long way ahead, but winter will be coming too quickly for those who cannot afford their fuel bills.\" Earlier this week, energy secretary Chris Huhne held a summit with small energy suppliers to find out what help they need to break the dominance of the big six gas and electricity companies and help keep domestic energy prices down. His plan is to cut the red tape that makes it difficult for smaller energy companies to compete with the big six providers. Huhne said today: \"Britain's consumers are being buffeted by the violent and unpredictable winds of global fossil fuel prices. I refuse to stand by and watch this happen. I'm pushing the big six suppliers to help their customers overhaul their draughty homes and understand the best tariffs on offer, and I'm backing new entrants to bring more competition to the market. \"The UK electricity market has to change so that we escape the cycle of fossil fuel addiction. Alternatives like renewables and nuclear power must be allowed to become the dominant component of our energy mix.\" Shadow energy secretary Meg Hillier said: \"Today's announcement is bad news for bill-payers across Britain. Just as their belts cannot get any tighter, a whopping increase in energy bills will be landing on their doormats. It's unfair, and many will feel they are being ripped off. \"Enough is enough. David Cameron is sitting on his hands whilst our gas and electricity bills soar. It is time for the Competition Commission to launch an investigation into the stranglehold the big six energy suppliers have on the market. The Tory-led government have failed to act on behalf of the public. Customers' household budgets are at breaking point, and this unfair British Gas price hike is the last straw.\" The British Gas managing director of services and commercial, Chris Jansen, said on Sky News this morning that he is happy for customers to email him at chris.jansen@britishgas.co.uk and he will respond personally."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/19/japan-fukushima-50-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-19T19:17:03Z","webTitle":"Japan prays for success of Fukushima 50 in fight to save nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/19/japan-fukushima-50-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/19/japan-fukushima-50-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Japan prays for success of Fukushima 50 in fight to save nuclear plant","bodyText":"Exhausted engineers attached a power cable to the outside of Japan's tsunami-crippled nuclear plant on Saturday. The operation raised hopes that it may be possible to restart the pumping of water into the plant's stricken reactors and cool down its overheated fuel rods before there are more fires and explosions. \"We have connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied,\" said a spokesman for the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power. However, officials said further cabling would have to be completed before they made an attempt to restart the water pumps at the Fukushima plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo. It was also reported that health workers had detected radiation levels in milk and spinach from farms in Fukushima and in neighbouring Ibaraki that breached safety limits, although it was claimed this represented no risk to human health. Officials have asked people living near the plant to follow basic safety advice when going outside: drive, don't walk; wear a mask; wear long sleeves; don't go out in the rain. Radiation levels in Tokyo were also said to be within safe limits. Nevertheless, the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a release of radioactive material from Fukushima. At the nuclear plant, firefighters continued to spray water to cool the dangerously overheated fuel rods in order to keep cores in its reactors from overheating and melting. The UN's atomic agency said that conditions at the plant remained grave but were not deteriorating, following Japan's decision to raise the severity rating of the nuclear crisis from level 4 to level 5 on the seven-level international scale. It put the Fukushima fires on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in the US in 1979. The explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 – which sent a plume of radioactive material into the skies 25 years ago – is the only incident to have reached level 7. Fires and explosions occurred at four of the six reactors at Fukushima last week after the 8.9 Richter earthquake and the ensuing tsunami that hit Japan on 11 March. The earthquake triggered an automatic shutdown of the three reactors that were in operation. The tsunami then damaged diesel generators that were providing back-up power for the pumps driving coolant through these reactors. As a result, heat could no longer be pumped away and temperatures inside the reactors' cores began to rise, eventually setting off a series of chemical fires. \"Hollow rods made of zirconium hold each reactor's uranium fuel pellets in place,\" said Professor Andrew Sherry, director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute in Manchester. \"When temperatures rise too much, that zirconium starts to react with the reactor's water. This chemical reaction raises temperatures even further. Hydrogen is also produced. When this hydrogen exploded, it destroyed the buildings that act as each reactor's outer protective shell.\" The explosions also damaged two storage tanks in which fuel rods – still hot because of the radioactive material inside them – were being stored in water. Water levels dropped, exposing fuel rods and triggering further chemical reactions between zirconium fuel cladding and the steam that had begun to build up. These set off fires in storage tanks at reactors three and four. As a result, plant workers, emergency services personnel and scientists have been battling for the past week to restore the pumping of water to the Fukushima nuclear plant and to prevent a meltdown at one of the reactors. A team of about 300 workers – wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed with duct tape and known as the Fukushima 50 because they work in shifts of 50-strong groups – have captured the attention of the Japanese who have taken heart from the toil inside the wrecked atom plant. \"My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,\" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. Little is known about this band of heroes, except for the few whose relatives have spoken to Japanese media. One woman said that her father, who had worked for an electricity company for 40 years and who was due to retire in September, had volunteered. \"I feel it's my mission to help,\" he told his daughter. On Wednesday, the government raised the cumulative legal limit of radiation that the Fukushima workers could be exposed to from 100 to 250 millisieverts. That is more than 12 times the annual legal limit for workers dealing with radiation under British law. Each team works as fast as possible for the briefest of periods. The pilots of the helicopters used to \"water-bomb\" the plant have been restricted to missions lasting less than 40 minutes. Nevertheless, the workers have not only managed to link a power cable to one of the plant's reactors, No 2, but they have also connected diesel generators to the No 5 and No 6 reactors, which have so far not suffered serious damage. \"If they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability,\" said Eric Moore, a nuclear power expert at US-based FocalPoint Consulting Group. However, the government has conceded that it was too slow in dealing with the crisis at Fukushima. Chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano said that \"in hindsight, we could have moved a little quicker in assessing the situation and co-ordinating all that information, and provided it faster\". The fires at Fukushima have also triggered serious criticism of the plant's design. The decision to place storage tanks close to reactors has been pinpointed as a key design error. When those reactors caught fire, they quickly triggered reactions in the storage tanks which themselves caught fire, and so the fires spread. In addition, the failure to build defences that could withstand the huge tsunami that struck Japan has also been attacked. \"The geological evidence in Japan indicates a history of giant tsunamis over the past several thousand years,\" said Professor Rolf Aalto, an Exeter University expert on tsunamis. \"Unfortunately, an engineering and political decision was made to design protection and plan cities around a hypothesised five-metre tsunami – about the size of those experienced in Japan over the last century. However, it was not a surprise to geologists that a tsunami two to three times larger appeared. Both the earthquake and tsunami were exceptional, but were both well within the realm of what can occur within that tectonic setting.\" However, Sherry defended the ageing plant – whose six reactors came on line between 1970 and 1979. \"These reactors were designed in the 1960s and we have learned a lot since then. Modern plants are much safer. Think of cars in the 1960s: they didn't have crumple zones, airbags or seat belts – features we all take for granted today. It is the same with nuclear reactor design.\" The Fukushima reactors, known as boiling water reactors, have active safety features – you have to do something to prevent dangerous heating, such as ensuring that the pumps are activated. \"By contrast, new reactors are designed to include 'passive' safety systems that are designed to shut down and cool fuel without the need for power being available at the plant,\" said Barry Marsden, professor of nuclear graphite technology at Manchester University. Modern reactors also have double or triple back-up safety systems. It remains to be seen if such reassurances will have an impact. The sight of explosions erupting from the reactors last week have done nothing for the prospects of the world's nuclear industry. It had been gearing up for a restoration of its fortunes, with governments across the planet turning to the power of the atom as a future energy source – one that does not pose major climate change risks. It now looks like a tarnished option, or at least that is how it will be portrayed by those who oppose an expansion of nuclear plant construction. \"European leaders must take note of the growing nuclear crisis in Japan, and act now,\" said Patricia Lorenz, nuclear campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe. \"Europe needs a phase-out plan for nuclear, and must open the way for safe solutions to climate change and energy security.\" There are signs that this message is getting through. Last week, the German government suspended its approval process for new nuclear construction projects. More significantly, China – the world's leader in nuclear expansion, with 28 plants under construction – followed suit. Whether these suspensions will last very long is a different matter. Much depends on the success of the Fukushima 50 and their bid to complete a power link between the stricken plant and the outside world. Failure would certainly do little for the reputation of nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/theatreblog/2011/feb/25/theatre-global-warming-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-25T16:51:54Z","webTitle":"Noises off: When is 'relevance' not relevant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/feb/25/theatre-global-warming-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/theatreblog/2011/feb/25/theatre-global-warming-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Noises off: When is 'relevance' not relevant?","bodyText":"When is a play about climate change not a play about climate change? As Lyn Gardner has reported, London has recently seen a flood of plays that explicitly tackle global warming – with Water at the Tricycle, Greenland at the National and The Heretic at the Royal Court. And, as Andrew Haydon explains, the polar bear seems to have become theatrical shorthand for all manner of impending apocalypses. Yet as Robert Butler of the Ashdenizen blog points out, some of the best insights into this problem can be found in plays that, ostensibly, have nothing to do with the issue. He links to this blogpost by Joe Smith, a senior lecturer in environment at the Open University, and one of the organisers of the Mediating Change: Culture and Climate Change series of podcasts. Smith was particularly struck by the way that the note of scientific hubris evident in Frankenstein resonates with similar attitude in contemporary approaches to green issues: \"... there is a Romantic anti-industrialisation/anti-urbanisation strand which runs through environmentalism from day one. But there are also strands in recent discourses of climate change 'solutions' that are in thrall to science and technology's apparent invincibility and adaptability. Hence the arch modernists who were formed in the whiteheatof technology environment of the 1950s and 1960s are happy to contemplate immense geo-engineering experiments and massive expansion of nuclear power – Science discovered this problem and Science will solve it.\" Butler goes on to argue that there are a number of other plays that can also teach us lessons about climate change. He notes that George Monbiot, in his book Heat, uses Dr Faustus as a prime example of our willing blindness when it comes to future catastrophe. And, in a separate post, he links to this article by Michael McCarthy in the Independent that finds an important lesson in Sophocles's Oedipus Rex. Oedipus's primary fault, according to McCarthy, \"was that he thought he knew everything, he had answered the riddle of the Sphinx, he was Mr Clever. The Gods showed him that he wasn't (and in the greatest of all tragic ironies, he puts out his eyes to punish himself for having been blind to his true situation, which now he can see)… In the modern consensus, in liberal secular humanism, this spiritual view of Man of having limits, of not being able to do everything he chooses, and of potentially being a problem creature, is missing entirely. There is no trace of it whatsoever.\" Much is made, these days, of the theatre's apparent ability to respond quickly to current affairs. However, this fetish for \"relevance\" misses the fact that the best art maintains its true relevance not by reacting quickly to the headlines, but by probing deeply into the fundamental things that make us human. The fact that stories like Frankenstein and Oedipus are able to shed light on a problem that only arose years (or centuries) after they were written is proof of this. Perhaps the real challenge for theatre-makers today is to create something which can not only speak to our contemporary environmental concerns, but which will also be relevant to whatever humanity's problems are a century from now. Although that assumes, of course, that the human race will still be around in a hundred years to watch them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/2011/apr/06/trident-us-arming-system-test","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-06T17:18:50Z","webTitle":"Trident more effective with US arming device, tests suggest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/06/trident-us-arming-system-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/apr/06/trident-us-arming-system-test","fields":{"headline":"Trident more effective with US arming device, tests suggest","bodyText":"Successful tests have been carried out in the US on a new warhead firing system to arm Britain's nuclear missiles, making them more accurate and more capable. The move underlines the extent to which Britain's Trident system is dependent on the US, and it could have serious implications for Britain's role in any future disarmament negotiations, military analysts and experts on British and US nuclear weapons say. The tests on an upgraded nuclear warhead component, called W76-1, to arm Britain's Trident missiles have been disclosed by Sandia National Laboratories in the US. \"The first W76-1 United Kingdom trial test\" provided data \"critical to the UK implementation of the W76-1\", according to a report in the latest issue of Sandia's official publication, Labs Accomplishments. Defence sources admit that the new arming device would make Britain's nuclear missiles more accurate and more effective. The Ministry of Defence has always been reluctant to comment publicly on plans to equip Britain's Trident missiles with US components. It describes the new US firing system fuse as a \"non-nuclear part\" of the warheads but insists that the nuclear warheads themselves are British designed and built. The submarines are designed in Britain but the Trident missiles are leased from the US. US navy officials say the upgraded American firing mechanism would make Trident missiles more effective against \"hard targets\". British defence officials privately agree. Such comments suggest \"a significant improvement of the military capability of the weapon\", Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said. \"The fuse upgrade appears to be modernisation through the back door,\" he added. Nick Ritchie, an expert on Trident and research fellow at Bradford University's Department of Peace Studies, said Sandia's revelations \"underline the extent to which the UK's nuclear weapons programme is fully integrated with the US programme, reinforcing our technical, political and financial nuclear dependency and a fuzzy, at best, notion of being an independent nuclear power.\" A new US arming, fusing, and firing system that controls the detonation of the warhead, combined with the high accuracy of Britain's Trident warheads will allow the UK to threaten hard targets such as underground bunkers, Ritchie added. He said the US programme would extend the service life of Trident warheads by 30 years. The government was first questioned about the new US components for Britain's Trident missiles in 2007 by Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman and now armed forces minister. Des Browne, then defence secretary, told him: \"I am not prepared to discuss the detailed performance characteristics of our nuclear weapons.\" The government is particularly sensitive about the Trident nuclear warhead upgrade as it could be seized on by non-nuclear states in any forthcoming international disarmament talks. The disclosures come at a time when discussions about how to replace the existing Trident system is causing severe strains within the government. Liam Fox, the defence secretary, insists the existing fleet of four submarines must be replaced like-for-like and Britain must persist with a continuous at-sea deterrent (CASD) – that is, having one nuclear-armed submarine on patrol every day of the year. Harvey told the Guardian earlier this year that alternatives did not seem to have been given detailed or objective assessments. \"The debate has been very much yes or no to this single notion of how a credible deterrent can be provided,\" he said. No date has yet been fixed for the \"initial gate\" decision on the design of the new Trident submarine fleet. The MoD first said it would be announced in December. One of the problems is what kind of nuclear reactor would propel the submarines. The choice is between the existing pressurised water (PWR2) reactor of the kind used in the navy's Astute-class conventionally armed submarines and a new PWR3 reactor of US design. A decision about the final makeup of a successor to the existing Trident system has been put off until after the general election, due in 2015. The MoD was unable to immediately respond to Sandia's disclosures or their significance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-fracking-greens-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-15T16:00:00Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock on shale gas and the problem with 'greens'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-fracking-greens-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-fracking-greens-climate","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock on shale gas and the problem with 'greens'","bodyText":"When I last interviewed James Lovelock in 2010, I provided here online fuller quotes of his key points than the print edition of the interview would allow. As it proved popular with readers last time round, I have taken the time again to transcribe his responses... Lovelock on \"fracking\": Gas is almost a give-away in the US at the moment. They've gone for fracking in a big way. This is what makes me very cross with the greens for trying to knock it: the amount of CO2 produced by burning gas in a good turbine gives you 60% efficiency. In a coal-fired power station, it is 30% per unit of fuel. So you get a two-to-one gain there straight away. The next two-to-one gain you get is that methane has only got half its energy in the carbon, the other half is in the hydrogen, so there's a four-to-one gain in CO2 output from the same amount of electricity by burning methane. Let's be pragmatic and sensible and get Britain to switch everything to methane. We should be going mad on it. The fear of nuclear is now too great after Fukushima and the cost of building new build plants is very expensive and impractical. And it takes a long time to get them running. It is very obvious in America that fracking took almost no time at all to get going. It happened without any debate whatsoever. Suddenly you found there was this abundant fuel source. There's only a finite amount of it [in the UK] so before it runs out we should really be thinking sensibly about what to do next. We rushed into renewable energy without any thought. The schemes are largely hopelessly inefficient and unpleasant. I personally can't stand windmills at any price. Hydro, biomass, solar, etc, have all got great promise, but they're not available tomorrow, or even in 10 years. There's a very good tidal stream farm that I've come across using a sunken barge with a turbine on it. It's much more reliable. They should have gone ahead with the Severn Barrage. On the urbanisation trend: Almost all over the first world people are moving into cities for good. This intrigues me. EO Wilson in America is beginning to get a lot of interesting data about social insects. He's come up with an extraordinary theory that the nest itself is the unit of selection, not the individual insects. That has enormous consequences. Now consider that applied to humans. If we all move into cities, they become the equivalent of a nest. Then another thought comes immediately from that: if that's the way the flow is going, don't stop it, let's encourage it. Instead of trying to save the planet by geoengineering, or whatever, you merely have to air-condition the cities. But you don't even have to do the experiment. You only have to go to Singapore. You could have not chosen a worse climate in which to build a city. It's a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every day and very humid. It's almost an unliveable climate. But it is one of the most successful cities in the world. It seems to me that they are treading the path that we are all going to go. It's so much cheaper to just air-condition the cities and let Gaia take care of the world. They are much less vulnerable in their skyscrapers. It will not be impossible in the future to grow the food it needs within the city. It's a much better route to go that so-called \"sustainable development\" which is meaningless drivel. On politicians: I'm neither strongly left or right, but I detest the Liberal Democrats. They are all well-meaning, but they have mostly had little experience of power. The coalition [government] has behaved disgraceful on environmental and energy policies. They haven't done at all well. It would have been much better if they had been properly rightwing. We haven't had one for a long time. I don't mean something like Thatcher; that was a revolutionary Conservative government. Just a regular one. Our political system works because they tend to self-correct each other. What you've got to avoid at all costs is ideologues. Germany is a great country and has always been a natural leader of Europe, and so many great ideas, music, art, etc, come out of it, but they have this fatal flaw that they always fall for an ideologue and Europe has suffered intensely from the last two episodes of that. And it looks to me as if the green ideas they have picked up now could be just as damaging. They are burning lignite now to try and make up for switching off nuclear. They call themselves green, but to me this is utter madness. All ideologues are harmful. They are never right. We get to our stable position through checks and balances. The whole of nature does that through natural selection. Proportional representation is a very bad idea and an absolute gift to ideologues. The problem with ideologues from Marx onwards is that they tend to imagine that human nature is very different from what it actually is. We're still animals and we behave like animals and it doesn't take much to knock our \"civilisation\" away. People are very, very sensitive about territory and if you move a new lot of people into their territory, they don't like it one bit. Politicians are very stupid if they think they can get away with that sort of thing. You could easily get me to generalise about things that I'm not really competent to talk about, but I do feel that's the case. It's not that people are racist per se. We're naturally racist, you can't get away from it. We try to curb it and be sensible. People are very rarely individually racist, but they don't want a large culture dumped on them. I don't know anyone personally who would be nasty to someone because of their colour or because they come from a different country. It's not in our style in these islands. Monarchy is a very good idea, I think. It means there's no way a politician can dominate. Monarchy ensures that there is someone you can't beat by being a crafty politician. On science: Science is going down the drain terribly fast. It keeps dividing itself up into expertises and these expertises probably don't know much about the others. I think in order to be a fully rounded person you have to learn to be a pro at one thing, but then you can become a generalist. On the reaction to his MSBC interview in April in which he said he had made a \"mistake\" with some of his \"alarmist\" climate predictions: I ignore the blogosphere. I don't know much about it other than an instinctive desire to keep out of it. It can be so rude from what I've seen. It's not my scene at all. I'm too old for that now. But the great thing about being an independent, though, is that you can afford to make mistakes. This is very important. You learn more from the mistakes. It's a natural part of the learning process. You should be allowed to make a mistake and suffer the consequences. I think the most outrageous example of climate scientists getting it wrong and not admitting it was the 2007 IPPC report. They happily accepted the Nobel prize, but their sea-level rise estimates, according to that very important Science paper by Rahmstorf (pdf), were 100% wrong. They didn't really answer this other than say it's a very complicated business and we've only just started. The IPCC is too politicised and too internalised. Whenever the UN puts its finger in it seems to become a mess. But I wish I knew of a better model than the IPCC. The burden of my thoughts are very much that the whole climate situation is more complex than we at present are capable of handling, or possibly even in the future. You can't treat it as a scientific problem alone. You have to involve the whole world and then there's the time constant of human activity. Look at how long ago the Kyoto Treaty was now – 15 years ago – and damn all has been done. The human time constant is very slow. You don't get major changes in under 50-100 years and climate doesn't wait for that. On adapting to climate change: You've got to cut back on burning fossil fuels, but you've also got to be sensible and reasonable. Like when in business, you've got to adapt to each new situation and try to survive until things get better. The ideologues come along and say stop burning all carbon now. It was like with the whole CFC affair. I got into big trouble and I discovered the bloody problem. They started to call me a denier because I said you can't just stop making CFCs immediately because refrigerators all around the world would break down and they'd be massive food poisoning. I said give the industry time to find safe alternatives. I said wave a stick at them to make sure they do it. That's the proper course of action. It's not all that different for climate. On his archive being donated to the Science Museum: I've got wonderful letters from all sorts of people. Lots of Nasa letters from the early 1960s. My first contact from them was in 1961, just three years after they'd been founded, just when they'd opened up their JPL lab. People at that time were shooting off to America for three times the salary. The brain drain was dreadful. I had lots of offers to go, but I felt I would be deserting them. I'd read science fiction since I was a small kid so when I got a letter from the director of space flight at Nasa I was gobsmacked. I realised I didn't want to spend the rest of my life as a civil servant and I didn't like the idea of having everything planned right up to my retirement. My boss [at the National Institute for Medical Research in London] said to me I'd be a fool to ignore it and out of all that, ultimately, came Gaia. I have a letter from Chuck Capen, who was the resident astronomer at JPL at that time, who brought in the data into the room I was in with Carl Sagan and Diane Hitchcock, discussing life of Mars. I remember him coming in and saying, \"Here's the data we've got on the atmosphere of Mars and Venus!\" I knew immediately by the levels of CO2 that they didn't have life. I'd written a paper in Nature the previous year saying if you want to know if there's life on a planet you need to analyse its atmosphere. And this confirmed it exactly. On sending rovers to Mars: It's cronyism again. Science is now divided up into warring tribes of cronies. The biologists are just one big tribe and in America the only thing that matters about Mars is to discover life. But we're almost certain there isn't. But they say, \"if there's water, there must be life!\" Why? It's the other way round. You have water there not because you don't get life without water, but because you don't get water without life. The biologists fight it like tooth and nail. There's a better chance there might be fossilised traces of former life, but it's taking an awful lot of time for even that degree of common sense to come through. If you speak to other scientists, meteorologists, etc, and you ask them how they would have spent those hundreds of millions on rovers, they would say that should have been spent studying the Earth itself. The universities encourage all this separation. On \"greens\": The greens use guilt. That shows just how religious the greens are. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting CO2 in the air. We do now know what we are doing when it comes to CO2 [emissions], but you don't have to go right over the top like the greens and shouting, \"You're guilty!\" I don't like it. On the Met Office Hadley Centre: I keep contact with the Hadley Centre. They are one of the best climate centres in the world. Something to be proud of. They should be given credit. They are under enormous pressure from government and are not allowed to say what they really think. But there's some really good scientists there. I like Richard Betts very much and respect him. He couldn't be a scientist and not discuss the uncertainties [in climate science]. Three cheers for him. On his advice to environmentalists: I wish I knew. One thing being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope you get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don't know it. It's just the way the humans go that if there's a cause of some sort, a religion starts forming around it. It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. I don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use. On climate sceptics: The people who don't believe in the environment and climate science, etc, are the deniers. They are a totally different category [to the greens]. They've got their own religion. They believe that the world was right before these damn people [the greens] came along and want to go back to where we were 20 years ago. That's also silly in its own way. I don't see how any true scientist could be either a believer or a denier. The term \"sceptic\" has been hijacked, too. On taking action on climate change: Just look at our own bodies and medicine. We don't understand everything and there's no point pretending we do. It's far too complex. But we can still take preventative measures. And the same applies to the Earth. I compare it with medicine at the time of the Battle of Waterloo where some poor bloke got half his leg blown off with a cannon ball and the only thing he could do was put the stump in a vat of boiling pitch to quarterise it and seal it. It's not that we have to do nothing, but you have to try and survive and adapt the best you can and keep your eyes open for the next solution. Avoid instant solutions. The greens are very bad at picking up things, such as homoeopathy. Prince Charles is like this. But it's absolutely rubbish. It has no scientific basis whatsoever. It's quackery. But there are some environmentalists who are swinging around now and moving away from all this. They're the sensible ones. On nuclear power and, again, \"fracking\": I think the reaction to Fukushima was a turning point. It meant to me at least that it's almost probably pointless to support nuclear now. The opposition to it now is just too powerful. It's not rational opposition. It's religious opposition. But we've got to survive and be pragmatic about this. If only society could think that way. OK, the greens are right that we shouldn't be putting CO2 into the atmosphere as it will knock us off in the long run. And, to be honest, it's probably too late now to change it. But we want to survive and for our children to have a future, so what do we do? The most sensible thing is nuclear, but I'm afraid the great bulk of people are not going to have it after Fukushima. They think nuclear actually caused the disaster. It's so bizarre that's it's almost unbelievable to a scientist, but they do. They conflate the two together. But maybe we've got enough shale [gas] under Britain. There's certainly lots of it. Now, that's not the complete answer, but it will carry us on for the next 20-30 years. It will be a bridging technology. I lived through the second world war and there was no way in 1939 that we could beat the Germans. But we were just bloody lucky to live on an island. That gave us time to pull our forces together so that we could hit back. We are in a very similar position now. Fracking buys us some time and we can learn to adapt. On Europe's shifting weather patterns: I think in Western Europe we've seen a lack of warming, or, as some people would see it, a positive cooling. But it isn't cooling as you get episodes of unusually cold weather interspersed with warm spells. It seems to be all over the place. I think the reasons for that are not that difficult. You only have to look at a big weather map and you'll see that the Atlantic frequently fills up with a large high and when it does they say it's the jet streams that are affected. But I think this is using symptoms to explain the disease. What happens is the warm air goes up the east coast of America, melts the ice in Greenland, and the floating Arctic ice swings round beautifully, air conditions the air, and swings down on us. It's all part of global warming. One of the consequences of that cooler water is that it floats on the top of the sea surface and as it comes down it passes over where previously the warm salt water was which drove the ocean conveyors. The fresh water coming in stops it dead. If that stops, the Gulf Stream stops. People think this means we will become Arctic, but that's nonsense - 75% of our heat comes from the westerly winds, not the Gulf Stream. It would be unpleasant without a Gulf Stream, but it would mean we would be more like Vancouver on the Pacific coast of America. But they [climate scientists] still don't put any of the living parts of the planet into the climate models. They are trying to do that now down at the Hadley Centre. They need to put the living parts in [to the climate models] as a responsive part."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/18/g7-japan-curb-soaring-yen-intervention","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-18T12:34:00Z","webTitle":"G7 rallies behind Japan in bid to curb soaring yen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/18/g7-japan-curb-soaring-yen-intervention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/18/g7-japan-curb-soaring-yen-intervention","fields":{"headline":"G7 rallies behind Japan in bid to curb soaring yen","bodyText":"The world's richest nations have rallied behind Japan in a bid to calm markets over the devastating earthquake and its aftermath. The G7 group, whose members include the United States and the UK, joined the Bank of Japan in stepping into the currency markets to curb the soaring yen. Recognising the damage that a rising national currency could do to an export-dependent economy, the Bank of England, Germany's Bundesbank, the Bank of France and the European Central Bank joined the BoJ on Friday morning in the first co-ordinated intervention by the G7 since the launch of the euro a decade ago. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to participate. The Japanese authorities blamed speculators for the dramatic surge in the yen since the earthquake struck a week ago. Dubbing them \"sneaky thieves\", Japanese deputy finance minister Fumihiko Igarashi said in an interview with Reuters: \"G7 countries agreed that if we caved in to such speculators that took advantage of people's misfortunes, the Japanese economy would be ruined and the whole world economy would be harmed. \"Our stance remains unchanged that we will take decisive steps against speculators who act like sneaky thieves at a scene of a fire.\" The G7 was ready to \"act decisively\" again against market speculators, he added. The BoJ reportedly bought $25bn (£15.5bn) of US currency in the wake of the G7 announcement late on Thursday. The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said the G7 move was intended to support Japan and lower the yen. \"The aim is obviously to support our Japanese partner, express our solidarity and to halt the yen's rise,\" she said on French radio station Europe 1. Having reached a price of ¥76.25 against the dollar, the yen has now weakened to ¥81.71. Japan's Nikkei share index rose 3% on news of the G7 and BoJ actions, but it is still down by around 10% on the week and set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008 banking crisis. The unresolved crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, where several reactors are close to meltdown, is one of the factors still weighing on investors' minds. Nonetheless, one market watcher told Reuters that the move would have a calming effect on the financial system. One of the concerns among investors and G7 politicians is that a mass repatriation of yen assets, such as bonds and other loans, could destabilise the global economy. \"This is the first co-ordinated intervention we have seen since 2000, so it's going to have a huge resonating effect on the market,\" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York, \"because the only type of intervention that works is co-ordinated intervention and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan.\" While the BoJ action was expected following interventions earlier in the week, the decision by the G7 nations of the US, the UK, France, Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan appears to have taken the markets by surprise. In a statement the G7 said: ''We express our solidarity with the Japanese people in these difficult times, our readiness to provide any needed co-operation and our confidence in the resilience of the Japanese economy and financial sector. As we have long stated, excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will monitor exchange markets closely and will co-operate as appropriate.\" However, a resurgent oil price also indicated renewed concern over events in the Middle East after the United Nations authorised military strikes against Colonel Gaddafi's forces. The price of Brent crude rose by more than $1 to $116.13 a barrel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/climate-change-negotiations-road-to-durban","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-02T15:12:20Z","webTitle":"Challenge and opportunity: the road to Durban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/climate-change-negotiations-road-to-durban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/climate-change-negotiations-road-to-durban","fields":{"headline":"Challenge and opportunity: the road to Durban","bodyText":"The next stage in the race to curb global warming is set, this time in Durban, South Africa, in December. While many of the political challenges remain familiar, recent major events cannot be overlooked by those involved in the negotiations as they bring the supply, security and acceptability of various energy sources to the forefront of the debate. The massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 have created an ongoing crisis – changing the daily lives of citizens both in the disaster areas and across the country. The events at Fukushima continue to have an impact on Japan's nuclear industry and have forced a rethink on the nation's energy policies. A possible policy shift by Japan on nuclear energy could result in major changes to previous greenhouse gas reduction commitments, especially last year's pledge to cut emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020. Global reactions Of course, the reactions to March's events in Japan are not limited to that country. They have complicated the plans of other nations to utilise nuclear energy as a main power source to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are already seeing this dynamic taking place in Germany. On 30 May the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, announced that the government had decided to phase out its nuclear reactors. Merkel's comments were a direct reaction to Fukushima. She said that Germany would turn to an ambitious path towards renewable sources of energy instead. The decision followed the recommendations of an expert commission appointed after the Japanese disaster which studied the country's use of nuclear power, an industry that generates 23% of Germany's electricity. A renewable path forward? A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presented a scenario showing that 77% of global energy could be produced from renewable energy sources by 2050. This outlook excludes nuclear – a major part of most countries' planned low-carbon energy mix. Such an ambitious path isn't unattainable but would require countries to commit to significant new infrastructure investments and major policy shifts away from traditional sources of power, particularly fossil fuels. It is too early to predict the extent to which the Japanese crisis will have an impact on other countries' decisions on their energy mix but it is an important aspect for climate change negotiators heading to Durban to consider. Any rethink on nuclear energy's role in combating global climate change will have serious consequences for emissions goals. What is a climate negotiator to do? Events in Japan have added complications to a situation already mired in political complexity and pessimistic forecasts for a major announcement on a legal agreement in Durban. Obviously, the complexity of issues, challenges and dilemmas facing diplomatic efforts are many. But this does not mean that there is not room for opportunity and optimism. Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), reinforces the urgent need for a commitment on global emissions. This is a sentiment I fully support, but the necessary action and steps that will drive a transformation in the way countries produce goods and services for economic development and how societies consume them will be driven by national actions. Investments depend on strong national and international frameworks that support business with the necessary incentives and stability. And these national actions should be driven by the recognition that being the leader in such a low-carbon transformation offers competitive advantage. There is a \"green race\" on for countries – and for business. There continues to be strong support for sustainable development, an area where the business sector has been a leader. As we look for ways to develop and increase economic growth in a carbon-constrained world, it is business that will lead the way in developing and deploying the low-carbon technologies and services that are needed, for instance, in the buildings sector. Energy use in buildings can be cut by over 50% by 2050 through the application of more efficient products, more efficient construction and management of buildings. It must be an essential element of national plans to meeting emissions targets. Among WBCSD member companies, more than 100 have signed up to improving energy performance in their own buildings through voluntary actions. We also see nations realising the opportunities of sustainability as a way to lower carbon emissions. Any incentives that advance this progress will enhance our ability to fight global climate change. So, while agreeing on a global framework for greenhouse gas emissions – and the mechanisms around financing, technology transfer and a measurable and verifiable reporting that can support this – is a priority, we cannot lose focus on the value of realistic and concrete actions that can transform economies and help them grow in a more sustainable manner. Business is a necessary part of this process, but it must be given, and must take, a more direct role in making this happen nationally through industry sector actions and in support of defining the international framework. The threat of global warming is simply too big for governments to spend more unproductive time arguing political positions and ignoring the imperative for accelerated action.

Their choice in art is a fitting reflection of the exuberant atmosphere in the city, where the White Nights festival is in full swing, complete with classical concerts at the Mariinsky Theatre and a performance by Sting in the grounds of the Winter Palace, former home of the czars. But the confident mood runs deeper and is underlined by the city's other current jamboree – the desperately showy St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Billed locally as Russia's Davos, after the Swiss resort which is home to an annual gathering of the great and good, this year's event surely lives up to the name. Chinese premier Hu Jintao shared the opening ceremony with his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, and a bevy of other presidents and kings of business and finance are here, all courting Russia's growing power as holder of the largest gas reserves in the world and some of its biggest oilfields. While Britain and other western nations are struggling with the downsides of soaring energy prices, Russia is soaking in cash. Gross domestic product increased by 4% last year – more than twice the UK's growth rate – and is expected to expand even faster this year. Advertising levels have more than doubled over the last 12 months while car sales have soared by 25% to nearly 2m vehicles a year. The roads in St Petersburg are gridlocked with black Range Rovers and BMWs 4x4s. And the glamour brands are selling out: Tag Heuer, the Swiss watch manufacturer, has just opened its first boutique in St Petersburg; Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods group, kept its local store open till after midnight on Thursday to deal with a rush of shoppers. Hu showered what he described as China's \"friendly neighbour and strategic partner\" with praise for its work in modernising its economy and raising living standards. The leader of the world's most populous nation said the two sides had agreed at earlier discussions in Moscow to raise bilateral trade to $100bn by 2015 and $200bn by 2020. There were promises to share nuclear power expertise and co-operate in \"green emerging industries\" as well as finance and science. Hu's more particular mission was to tie Russia down to a 30-year gas supply deal with China that could be worth up to $1 trillion, to help power Beijing's booming economy and allow Moscow to diversify its exports away from Europe. Behind the scenes, Russia reportedly showed its strength by refusing to bow to demands that prices be cut, so a deal has yet to be sealed. Later it was the turn of industry to tip the cap to Russia. BP's Bob Dudley, Shell's Peter Voser and ExxonMobil's Neil Duffin were among dozens of international energy bosses keen to discuss cooperation with the Russian president. But while everything has a bright new sheen in Russia – even the female sales staff from state gas group Gazprom were decked out for the forum in what look like silky ballgowns – scratch the surface and some uglier old stereotypes remain. Hardships The new wealth is largely going into the hands of the relatively small – albeit growing – top layer of the middle class. The majority of the population, particularly those living in rural areas, suffer continuing hardships – not least from relatively high domestic energy prices. Corruption also remains a serious problem. Transparency International, which monitors the problem, claimed in its last annual report that graft had increased in Russia. The nation's transparency rating fell from last year's 2.2 to 2.1, on a scale of 0.0 (\"highly corrupt\") to 10.0 (\"very clean\"). Additionally, its country ranking fell from 146 out of 180 countries to 154 out of 178 countries, landing between Papua New Guinea and Tajikistan. Professor Vladimir Kvint, a professor at the Moscow School of Economics, told the Guardian that energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product in Russia was 40% behind the US and 80% below China. He confirmed that immorality was a serious issue throughout business – but also the wider judicial system. \"There needs to be a brutal war against corruption,\" he said. \"Deng [Xiaoping] killed corruption at the top level [in China]. We need a huge clearout – perhaps fire all judges and hire a new young generation on three times the salary.\" And down the road from the glossy St Petersburg summit is an alternative economic forum being held by the Other Russia party. Its leading lights also claim corruption is being overlooked and that Medvedev is not doing enough to diversify the economy away from oil and gas. In fact, the president certainly could not be accused of ducking the country's problems when he gave his opening speech. Even in the presence of Hu and so many foreign dignitaries he admitted that corruption was \"suffocating the economy\" and promised to stamp it out. But Medvedev was upbeat, insisting he wanted nothing to do with \"state capitalism\" and wished to increase the private sector's hold on the economy. The question is whether his bold words can be matched with effective action. One trainee architect looking at the Picasso paintings at the Hermitage was hopeful about Medvedev's Russia, but not taking anything for granted. \"Me and all my friends joke with each other that if the country starts slipping back towards communism we will be first on the plane to New York\" she said. \"Actually, it's not a joke.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2011/oct/18/guardian-weekly-letters-21-september","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-18T12:59:02Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 21 October 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/oct/18/guardian-weekly-letters-21-september","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2011/oct/18/guardian-weekly-letters-21-september","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 21 October 2011","bodyText":"Polly Toynbee talks of jobs and growth as if they are inseparable (Tories have little cause to be smug, 7 October). Yes, an economic recession can be bad news for a lot of people, particularly when the pain is sudden, unplanned and unequally distributed – unemployment and pay cuts for some, business as usual for others. No, I don't know a measure for real wealth, the sort that increases human happiness, though I wouldn't argue with your article Britain has Europe's worst quality of life. But if we continue to treat economic growth as good, we have the wrong language to manage our resources. The Guardian Weekly has run plenty of articles on peak oil, peak food, peak pretty much everything. But turn to the economics section or any article that uses the language of economists and you could be reading about a different planet. Economists talk about growth, development, recovery, strength and other implicitly positive terms when more often than not they are talking about more ways to weaken and deplete our natural resources and accelerate destructive climate change. Living within our means is inevitable; it's time to recognise that and give people realistic prospects. When I recognised that I needed a policy of planned recession on my waistline, I lost 10kg of unwanted growth, with a few ups and downs. But at least I knew which way was up. If it had been reported in the economics section of this paper, the headline would have been 'Developing waistline shows signs of rapid recovery'. David Roman Newport, UK Working in Britain On the one hand, \"eight in 10 British workers are overweight or living with long-term illnesses that limit their productivity\" (Illness hampers workforce, 7 October). On the other, \"bosses will no longer be able to set a mandatory retirement age as the government brings in changes to reflect people living longer, healthier lives\" (Forced retirement scrapped, 7 October). Long-term illness appears to be logically incompatible with healthier lives. If policy is predicated on empirical analysis of actual data, then one of the two assertions has to be false. Perhaps the problem is one of grammar: longer and healthier than what – Bangladeshi rice farmers, 19th-century factory workers? Or perhaps the incoherence is a reflection of the claim made in the other article on the same page that Britain has Europe's worst quality of life, one component of which is the inability to think clearly. Or is the Guardian testing readers' capacity to detect contradiction? George Holoch Hinesburg, Vermont, US • David Brindle's article mentions an independent review of sickness absence from work. Have they not heard of the term \"pulling a sickie\"? And is \"presenteeism\" a case of people turning up for work when they are ill, or rather a case of people turning up for work when they feel they are well enough to work? How do doctors decide whether a person who complains of stress is fit to work or not? How about some sympathetic support for employers who have to deal with stress resulting from regular staff absenteeism? Sunil Bajaria Bromley, UK Faithful to the niqab How full of contradictions your article is: two close-up photos of Muslim women (surprisingly willing to be photographed); the strange example of a woman who didn't wear the veil to work before the ban but has worn it since – if that isn't provocation, I don't know what is (Firmly faithful to the niqab, 7 October). Many women used to justify wearing the veil to avoid being bothered by men; now they say they are because of it – rather illogical. Whether one likes to admit it, these women and their supporters want to \"test the Republic\" – to see how far they can go. The slogan accompanying the law is la République se vit à visage découvert (one lives fully in the Republic with an uncovered face), which seems normal if a community is supposed to live openly together. The French constitution is based on secularism and guarantees absolute freedom to practise one's religion, but this is considered to be a private matter, not to be ostentatiously exhibited in public. It is defended not only by the French left – as your journalist makes out at one point – but also by the right, which she nevertheless implies at another point when wrongly considering it a political move by Sarkozy to gain votes. Caution was indeed taken not to target the niqab alone but any total face covering. Unfortunately, she chooses to illustrate her argument an incident with rightwing J F Copé in Meaux and then makes a scandalous comparison between the treatment of veiled women and Jews during the war – if anyone knows about the latter, it's Copé. Your journalist has the impertinence to say that France will be made a laughing stock and then goes on to list all the other European countries who have introduced bans or are intending to – at least France will not be alone. Why this constant obsession with the niqab in France? Is it because a similar problem exists in Great Britain – there have been several incidents regarding teachers etc – but no one dares to do anything? Or is it just another form of French-bashing? This is biased, poorly constructed journalism worthy of the tabloids – giving so much space to such a small minority just to shock. What about giving voice to the vast majority of Muslims who practise their religion without any need for the niqab and whose only desire is to integrate? Alexandra Tavernier Marcq-en-Baroeul, France • I noted the account of one woman wearing a niqab while swimming. If people go into the water wearing loose and flowing clothing, they are likely to find swimming difficult and drowning more likely. If they get into difficulty they are likely to incur displeasure from lifeguards who do not welcome unnecessary rescue work for swimmers who should know better. If people must be demure when they swim, can I suggest wearing a wetsuit, a good bathing cap and goggles. While wetsuits are close fitting, they provide insulation against the cold, as well as full covering. They enable people to swim for long periods in the sea – particularly away from the tropics. Safety trumps modesty and religious conviction. Thomas F McGrath Wellington, New Zealand Silence over Japan Jonathan Watts's thoughtful article (Contaminated by mistrust, 30 September) led me to think that we might also learn much from Japan about another pressing issue. Unless we achieve the Holy Grail by freeing GDP growth from real-world resource constraints, the world economy will hit the buffers. Real-world resource constraints occur when the supply of a resource runs out, when the resource becomes too expensive to exploit or when the use of the resource is curtailed because the risks of using it are deemed unacceptable. Think asbestos and mesothelioma, nuclear power and radiation risk, or fossil fuels and climate change. In the 1980s the Japanese economy grew so rapidly that articles on this economic miracle, and what the west might learn from it, were two a penny. But in the last 20 years Japanese GDP has grown only 1% a year, more slowly than other major developed economies. How have the Japanese adapted to this change? This aspect of Japan's experience could be relevant for our global future. Why are our economic and social commentators, and the mainstream media, so silent? David Teather Canberra, Australia What are deluxe benefits? In When Restraint finally pays off, Michael Birnbaum of the Washington Post refers to Germany's programmes to support working families, annual vacation leave and medical services supported by taxation as deluxe \"aspects of German welfare state\" (30 September). These are not deluxe programmes nor do they make Germany a \"welfare state\"; rather they are the minimum that should be available to support working families with in every developed nation. Only from the perspective of one who believes what is provided in the US is the appropriate level of provision do the programmes provided in Germany and other northern European communities look \"deluxe\". I do expect the Guardian Weekly to take more care and not permit such propaganda to creep in. If I want to read propaganda against the \"welfare state\", I can pick up any newspaper from the US. B Hendricks Loon Lake, British Columbia, Canada Briefly • In the midst of your excellent article on Cern was a small, frequently committed misconception (7 October). Einstein did indeed win the 1921 Nobel prize, but for his elucidation of the photoelectric effect, not the theory of relativity. Robert Gardiner Welshman's Reef, Victoria, Australia • You have a typo in the book review of David Gilmour's the Pursuit of Italy (7 October).

A once seemingly unstoppable nuclear resurgence falters with Germany's decision to abandon its entire programme by 2022, and we learn that not even the most severe economic collapse for decades has stopped the rise of greenhouse gas emissions, in poor or rich countries. What could the UN meetings in Bonn next week do differently to shed the torpor of current negotiations and re-energise the process? Here are 10 carefully considered and completely serious suggestions. 1. Move the negotiations to a small, low-lying nation, like Tuvalu (assuming that it would have them). Time the meetings to occur when seasonal tides are highest and when water covers much of the island. Distribute the working groups, canteens and plenary sessions around the various islets of the atoll to give the delegates a flavour of what life will be like for the environmentally displaced in a world in which they have failed to halt dangerous climate change. 2. Deal with denial. Denial seems to be a common problem. We are currently waving goodbye to the climatic conditions that were kind enough to usher in human civilisation, and still heading in the wrong direction. Yet there are many well known strategies for dealing with denial. Each UN session could begin, for example, with state of the art group therapy, each delegation could replace their usually embedded corporate lobbyists with the best counselling skills available. Delegates from frugal under-emitting nations could \"buddy\" carbon-addicted delegates from heavy polluters. 3. Stop using fantasy carbon accounting that allows rich countries to \"offshore\" their emissions. The current system dumps responsibility for the pollution created by manufacturing goods on the exporting country, not on the country that demanded and ultimately consumes the product. It allows countries like the UK to look much better than we really are, creating an illusion of progress and resulting in complacency. 4. Experiment more. Progress is deadlocked because the default position of national delegations is to negotiate not for the greater good, but for short-term national advantage. It doesn't work. Why not experiment with something that breaks the link. A representative but independent council could be created within the system, mandated to set targets, timetables and distribute responsibility for cutting emissions. Its brief would be to pursue the best course for humanity as a whole. 5. To get in touch with how to create real change on the street, in local economies and communities, all climate negotiators should either set up, or join, a Transition Town initiative. These are built around practical energy descent paths. They are about doing as much as talking, and force you to develop those currently ailing practical problem-solving skills. 6. Get rid of the circus shows. The UN climate talks too often resemble commercial technology trade shows. At an early one I attended the nuclear industry was handing out squishy foam light bulbs to calm people's concerns about it. It's a distraction, such circuses create the impression that a few new energy gizmos will solve the problem, allowing business as usual to continue, when what is needed is to rethink our economic model and have far more social innovation. They should clear out the trade fairs (they'll find somewhere else to sell) and showcase instead new economic thinking and experiments with new ways of living and working (like how a recession-driven four-day week left some people happier and cut carbon). 7. Mobilise the same amount of money that was used to bail out states and banks in the wake of the financial market failures, and use it to invest in smart grids and mixed renewable energy systems. That scale of investment could, potentially, displace fossil fuels at a stroke. At the same time, stop obsessing about the red herring of nuclear power. It won't save us. A comprehensive, favourable assessment by MIT concluded that even under an almost unimaginably positive scenario, containing several major unsolved problems, nuclear would only increase its global share of electricity generation by 2%. 8. Agree to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and redirect the money into national \"green new deals\" that will create jobs, reskill people who are out of work, bring enormous economic benefits, more comfortable homes, and insulate countries from energy price shocks, as well as cutting emissions. 9. Make key goals more visible. Achieving 30% emissions cuts by 2020, which is needed to keep the world on track, requires keeping the issue on everyone's minds, at least until some momentum is created and there is a sense that we really are all in this together. It needs to be visible, like the collection of metal railings for the war effect from outside people's homes in Britain during the second world war. How about a global \"Lights out at 11\" measure? In every city where empty office blocks and other buildings are lit throughout the night, save energy, cut light pollution and remind everyone of what we're trying to achieve by turning the lights out. 10. Finally, solving this problem is going to need everyone's input. It's our problem as much as theirs. So No 10, I'm leaving blank, a space for you to fill ..."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/11/green-week-politics-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-11T13:54:00Z","webTitle":"'Green week': the verdict on the UK government's policy push | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/11/green-week-politics-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/11/green-week-politics-energy","fields":{"headline":"'Green week': the verdict on the UK government's policy push","bodyText":"So that was the UK government's \"green week\", with money for renewable heat and big cuts in its own emissions, plus plenty of news it didn't plan, including our revelation that the Prime Minister's next environment and energy advisor will come from BP. It's time to reset our green-o-meter, which tracks the progress of the \"greenest government ever\". Here's my thinking. Renewable heating: The biggest event is the £860m scheme to subsidise clean heating systems, through the department for energy and climate change's Renewable Heat Incentive. It's not just a lot of money: heating is as essential as food and water and putting it on to a sustainable long term footing is critical. Heating also produces just under half of the UK's carbon emissions, so provides a huge opportunity to meet the nation's climate change targets. This scheme will prevent the emission of carbon equivalent to 20 gas power stations, says Decc. The scheme is delayed for households till October 2012 and there's no provision for air source heat pumps, but overall this move is a big plus. Green investment bank: There is now no place for the government to hide after MPs on the Environment Audit Committee made it crystal clear on Friday that the GIB has to be a fully functioning bank, if it is to raise the billions of investment needed to green and revive the UK's economy. Nor should there be any place to hide: the GIB was championed by the Conservatives in opposition and was a manifesto promise for both coalition partners. Treasury officials have already killed another coalition pledge - green savings schemes, or ISAs - but the budget on 25 March must deliver the GIB in full, not as a mere fund that might one day become a bank. Ministers have yet to make the decisions, so it's all to play for. Carbon plan: The key to this initiative, backed by David Cameron and Nick Clegg, is the deft political manoeuvre by Chris Huhne, Decc's secretary of state, that is compellingly described by Michael Jacobs (who knows intimately how government operates). Will the attempt to bounce the Treasury, Transport and others into green moves such as an operational GIB and a plan for electric car infrastructure work? They had better, now the promised dates have been set down in black and white. The other important part of the plan, though not so new, is the commitment to keep cutting the government's own emissions, something it started by emulating the 10:10 campaign. Seeing the government walk the walk, not just talk the talk, is really important in building public confidence. Europe's 25% emissions cut target: European climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard this week fought off the fossil fuel lobby and indicated that Europe's current 2020 target of 20% will be raised. Huhne can take some credit here as he has been a vocal and consistent supporter of raising the ambition. Another plus. Electricity market reform: The government has committed to a complete overhaul of the UK's energy market, which is perhaps the most liberalised in the world. It rightly recognises the status quo cannot deliver low-carbon, sustainable energy. That's the good news. The bad news is that there is no agreement that the highly complex and interacting measures proposed will do the job. Even within single energy companies, opinion is divided. And policy expert Professor Catherine Mitchell go further today on our site, suggesting the entire edifice is constructed to enable new nuclear power stations to received subsidies. Not a minus mark - yet - as the goverment has yet to respond. So overall, it was a positive week with some of the key green initiatives arriving or getting a bit closer. Much remains to be delivered, but I have pushed the green-o-meter up a notch. Let me know if you agree in the comments below.

A government official explained: \"Over the last 30 years, we've watched information technology revolutionise industry after industry, dramatically improving the customer experience and driving down costs. Today, in almost every other sector besides health, electronic information exchange is the way we do business. A cashier scans a bar code to add up our grocery bill. We check our bank balance and take out cash with a debit card that works in any ATM machine.\" As an incentive, the Obama administration will provide doctors and hospitals substantial bonuses to adopt electronic medical records as part of a federal multibillion-dollar investment, which includes health information technology regional extension centres (sound Orwellian enough?) where providers can ascertain which health record system best suits them. Fine in theory. The electronic medical record is supposed to reduce paperwork, increase efficiency and improve health outcomes. In practice, it's not so simple. No one has yet demonstrated improved patient outcomes using electronic medical records. Moreover, without uniform standards, digital records are expensive to install and difficult to use. Considering diverse needs and different computer preferences in the medical community, uniform national medical record standards are a long way off in America. This does not mean the electronic medical record should not be implemented. By themselves, electronic medical records are neither good nor bad; they are simply a product of technology like television, internal combustion engines or nuclear power. Like them, it depends on how they are used. Electronic medical records work best for data retrieval: X-rays, patient consultations and medical literature can be made available to doctors anywhere, anytime. But electronic records sometimes compare unfavourably to paper. Paper charts read like novels with narrative flow; electronic medical record read like technical manuals. At times, technical manuals are preferable, but other times, the patient's story gets lost, buried in rigid software templates that don't fit the particular patient, avalanches of extraneous information (computers ignore nothing), and cut-and-paste repetitions (easy to do). Privacy and patient access remain unresolved issues. The British experience with electronic medical records is instructive. An American official enviously praised the NHS as \"one of the truly astounding human endeavours of modern times\", but neglected to mention the disappointing NHS effort with electronic medical records. The costly programme to make patient records digitally available to every hospital, originally scheduled for completion in 2006, will not be ready until at least 2015. Even if the NHS meets that deadline, the system is certain to be obsolete the moment it goes online. University of London Professor Trisha Greenhalgh explained it best: \"Depressingly, outside the world of the carefully-controlled trial, between 50% and 80% of electronic health record projects fail – and the larger the project, the more likely it is to fail. […] Our results provide no simple solutions to the problem of failed electronic patient records projects, nor do they support an anti-technology policy of returning to paper. Rather, they suggest it is time for researchers and policymakers to move beyond simplistic, technology-push models and consider how to capture the messiness and unpredictability of the real world.\" Ironically, regardless of federal subsidies in the US, virtually every American and British hospital and clinic will soon employ some form of electronic medical record. New generations of doctors, nurses and administrators moving into hospitals grew up with computers and have never known another way. They expect to use computers and couldn't navigate the hospital without them. They will demand and install the necessary technology, regardless of whether electronic medical records are beneficial to patients. Paper records are the horse and buggy. Even so, it isn't necessary for government to pay to abandon the horse and buggy. That happens of its own accord. Investing billions of dollars in electronic medical record projects is classic government overreach. Good technology is adopted. Bad technology isn't – it's always that way. All the government money and training in the world doesn't change that. Spend it on patient care. Creeping depersonalisation is a final potential problem with electronic medical records. The medical profession, not the government, must ensure personnel don't spend all their time and attention with the computer instead of the patient. (That does happen.) The grocery bar code and ATM machine are efficient, albeit depersonalising examples of technology influencing our lives. Medicine, however, is best delivered with greater personal attention to the patient, not less."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/14/naoto-kan-japan-earthquake-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T01:15:40Z","webTitle":"Japanese prime minister calls for unity in country's 'worst crisis since the war'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/14/naoto-kan-japan-earthquake-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/14/naoto-kan-japan-earthquake-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Japanese prime minister calls for unity in country's 'worst crisis since the war'","bodyText":"How Japan must long for the time, a few days ago, when their only crisis to worry about was the possibility of yet another prime minister resigning. Such mundane political uncertainty has been swept aside by seismic calamity, and the man who was last week under threat from a funding scandal has been thrust into the role of commander-in-chief in a battle against Japan's most formidable peacetime enemy: the forces of nature. On Sunday evening , the people who had half-expected Naoto Kan, the prime minister, to join a string of ignominious exits, were watching him make an unusually passionate plea for unity and resilience - the same qualities that had lifted Japan from postwar despair. \"Japan is facing its worst crisis in the 65 years since the war,\" Kan said in a televised message to the public. \"All of the people [in] Japan face a test to see if we can overcome it. I believe we can.\" While raw emotion guides the behaviour of the millions of people caught up in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami and earthquake, the rest of the country is responding with determination and a communal grief that is as genuine as it is understated. Among the distant observers in areas that have been spared the misery, there is little sense of relief; only recognition that as residents of a country whose ground shifts with alarming regularity, they had been granted a reprieve. All other news, and practically all other programming, has been ditched so that public and private broadcasters can bring updates and earthquake warnings to a transfixed, and spooked, public. In Tokyo, the talk among neighbours who might otherwise barely have spoken to pass the time of day was now animated, dominated by the disaster that had befallen all. While the streets are apparently returning to a kind of normality, as train and subway lines resume service, the course of events several hundred kilometres away are being viewed with as much anxious self-interest and foreboding as with horror and sympathy for victims of whose lives and fates they had been in ignorance of until now. The threats of further strong quakes and a nuclear accident had residents of Tokyo scrambling into survival mode. It was next to impossible to buy such emergency necessities as batteries, bottled water and candles, or even fresh food in the shops of central Tokyo, while there were reports that large numbers of expatriates were heading overseas or, with their Japanese colleagues, relocating to other cities even further from the epicentre. After a weekend defined by fear, public and commercial life will begin the working week racked by uncertainty. The Tokyo stock exchange will open, but much else will feel alien to citizens of a country stereotyped but envied for its convenience and efficiency. Manufacturers accustomed to lower output in the financial crisis now have to deal with total shutdowns. Homes and businesses in each one of the 23 wards in Tokyo will be without power for three hours on a rotating basis; then another area will have to share blackout duties until power supplies return to normal, which may not be until the end of April. Amid the show of unity, a few voices of dissent are heard. One newspaper devoted space to the government's \"inept\" handling of the radioactive leakage in Fukushima, and the slow pace of the evacuation effort. Campaigners have resumed their criticism of Japan's dependence on nuclear energy, and, in particular, of the wisdom of building nuclear power plants on the coastline of the world's most seismically active country. Japan is gripped by fear about nuclear meltdown and anxiety over what the post-quake future holds for its economy and battered energy infrastructure. But it is coming to terms with the tragedy in the only way it knows how: with a restrained tenacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/30/radiation-rises-seawater-fukushima-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-30T09:51:00Z","webTitle":"Radiation rises in seawater near Fukushima plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/radiation-rises-seawater-fukushima-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/30/radiation-rises-seawater-fukushima-plant","fields":{"headline":"Radiation rises in seawater near Fukushima plant","bodyText":"Japanese officials have conceded they are no closer to resolving the nuclear crisis at Fukushima Daiichi power plant, as new readings showed a dramatic increase in radioactive contamination in the sea. The pressure to make progress also took its toll on Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the plant's operator, whose chief executive, Masataka Shimizu, was taken to hospital on Tuesday night suffering from exhaustion. The country's nuclear and industrial safety agency, Nisa, said radioactive iodine-131 at 3,355 times the legal limit had been identified in the sea about 300 yards south of the plant, although officials have yet to determine how it got there. Hidehiko Nishiyama, a Nisa spokesman, said fishing had stopped in the area, adding that the contamination posed no immediate threat to humans. \"We will find out how it happened and do our utmost to prevent it from rising,\" he said. The government's acceptance of help from the US and France has strengthened the belief that the battle to save the stricken reactors, now well into its third week, is lost. On Tuesday, a US engineer who helped install reactors at the plant said he believed the radioactive core in unit 2 may have melted through the bottom of its containment vessel and on to a concrete floor. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, could not say how long the operation at Fukushima would last. \"We are not yet in a situation were we can say we will have this under control by a certain period,\" he said. While Nisa officials attempted to play down the contamination's impact on marine life, any development that heightens health concerns among consumers will dismay local fishermen, many of whom already face a long struggle to rebuild their businesses after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. Experts say the radiation will be diluted by the sea, lessening the contamination of fish and other marine life. Robert Peter Gale, a US medical researcher who was brought in by Soviet authorities after the Chernobyl disaster, said recent higher readings of radioactive iodine-131 and caesium-137 should be of greater concern than reports earlier this week of tiny quantities of plutonium found in soil samples. But he added: \"It's obviously alarming when you talk about radiation, but if you have radiation in non-gas form I would say dump it in the ocean.\" Gale, who has been advising the Japanese government, said: \"To some extent that's why some nuclear power plants are built along the coast, to be in an area where the wind is blowing out to sea, and because the safest way to deposit radiation is in the ocean. \"The dilutional factor could not be better – there's no better place. If you deposit it on earth or in places where people live there is no dilutional effect. From a safety point of view the ocean is the safest place.\" Analysts said a prolonged crisis at the Fukushima plant could place intolerable pressure on the economy. \"The worst-case scenario is that this drags on not one month or two months or six months, but for two years, or indefinitely,\" said Jesper Koll of JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo. \"Japan will be bypassed. That is the real nightmare scenario.\" Criticism of Tepco is building after safety lapses last week put three workers in hospital – all have been discharged – and erroneous reports of radiation data. Shimizu, 66, has not been seen since appearing at a press conference on 13 March, two days after the disaster. He had reportedly resumed control of the operation at the firm's headquarters in Tokyo after suffering a minor illness, but on Tuesday he was admitted to hospital suffering from high blood pressure and dizziness. Tepco said on Wednesday that he was not expected to be absent for long. Tepco shares plunged by almost 18% on Wednesday morning and have lost 75% of their value since 11 March. Reports on Tuesday said the government was considering nationalising the beleaguered utility. The hundreds of workers at the plant must now find a balance between pumping enough water to cool the reactors and avoiding a runoff of highly radioactive excess water. As yet they do not have anywhere to store the contaminated water. The options under consideration were to transfer the water to a ship or cover the reactors to trap radioactive particles, Edano said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/oct/20/hugh-muir-diary-coalition-government","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-19T23:15:00Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/hugh-muir-diary-coalition-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/oct/20/hugh-muir-diary-coalition-government","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"• A week after the coalition government indicated it would accept the Browne recommendations on university funding, this is the word from Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes, speaking to activists in Wales. \"We are clear as a party across Great Britain that our policy is not to have an increase in tuition fees,\" he said. \"That is still our policy and it's our objective.\" And on the very day that climate change secretary Chris Huhne announced the locations envisaged for the new generation of nuclear plants, this was Hughes on that landmark policy. \"We must continue as a party to oppose a new generation of nuclear power stations ... Until somebody has found a safe way not just of storing but of disposing of waste in a world [with] increasing numbers of mad groups who go around trying to blow up other people, we really ought to be doing something that doesn't have all the risks of nuclear power.\" And he is equally scathing about the Con-Dem housing policies. Do you think the deputy leader is comfortable with this coalition thing? • Hughes needs a good spin doctor to explain that this is just the new politics. Finsbury PR, maybe. They are hot; award winners. The latest, courtesy of the charity Survival International, is the PR Disaster of the Year award for the company's work on behalf of the British mining company Vedanta Resources. Vedanta had exciting plans to build a bauxite mine in the hills of Niyamgiri, near Orissa, India – which would, it was claimed, have devastated the lives of indigenous tribes there and threatened the ecosystem. Despite the spinners insisting that the company had adhered throughout to best practice, celebrities such as Joanna Lumley and Michael Palin spoke out against it. And the high point, from Finsbury's point of view, must have been when the Independent wondered whether Vedanta was, in fact, \"the most hated company in the world\". Vedanta and Finsbury lost, because the Indian government blocked the proposal, but it was top-notch work in the battle for public opinion. The surgery was a great success. Shame about the patient. • Finsbury could offer its services to Father Stephen Bould, whose parish in Folkestone, Kent, may be the first to defect wholesale from the Church of England to Rome because of the former's embrace of female bishops. But, for all the days in the media spotlight, he says he is coping. We raise with him the fact that his late mother attained the position of overseer in the Quakers – the equivalent of a bishop. But he says we, like so many critics, misunderstand his position. He offers no criticism, implied or otherwise, on the capabilities of women. \"We keep saying it, but people don't believe it.\" The public is like that. A job for Finsbury, we think. • And only the planning of a Coulson, a Mandelson or perhaps a Finsbury could have ensured that Georgie Osborne would spell out his savagery towards the public finances on World Statistics Day. Today, the Royal Statistical Society launches Getstats, a 10-year campaign to build statistical understanding across society. That should be good for George. But it isn't so good for George. Because Ipsos Mori research released to coincide with it also shows that more than half of us look particularly askance at government figures and suspect the stats they give out have all been subject to political interference. It is into this prevailing wind then, that he sets sail later today. Lifejackets everybody. • Confusion on the Isle of Wight after our item recalling a visit to Parkhurst, the maximum security jail, by the late Dame Joan Sutherland. The memory came from a former inmate who remembered her performance and her lack of airs and graces. Which was nice. But time does things to the memory, and checks on the island have failed to bring forth any further details of a visit by Dame Joan Sutherland. All that can be found is a visit to Parkhurst in 1964 by the celebrated soprano, Dame Joan Hammond. So many Dame Joans, so long ago. Add to the mix another female star, Joan Rhodes, who also performed at Parkhurst, and you begin to see the problem. Her forte was tearing up telephone books and bending bits of metal.

Last year, the UK slumped from being third in the world in terms of investment in green growth, to only 13th place, , according to a report by the respected US Pew Environment Group. This means the UK now ranks well behind developing countries such as Brazil, in sixth place, India in 10th place and China in first place. Investment in alternative energy and clean technology reached $11bn (£7bn) in the UK in 2009, but plummeted to only $3.3bn (£2bn) last year - a decline of 70%. This compares with $2.3bn (£1.45bn) investment in Mexico last year, $4bn (£2.5bn) in France and $14bn (£8.7bn) in Italy. Top of the league is China, with $54bn (£34bn), Germany with $41.2bn (£25.7bn) and the US, with $34bn (£21bn) of investment last year. The news comes ahead of a crucial cabinet discussion of the UK's climate change targets beyond 2020. There are still deep divisions between the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which is calling for tough targets to stimulate green growth, and the Treasury and the Department of Business, which argue that the current economic situation calls for less stringent targets in 10 years' time. Ministers must decide whether to adopt recommendations made by the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body that is charged with advising the government on how to meet long-term climate change targets. The committee said last year the UK should aim to cut emissions by 60% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. A decision should be taken soon on whether to follow that advice, if ministers are to enact the new target into law this autumn, as the Climate Change Act requires. The Pew report blamed the UK's fall down the ranking on \"a sharp decline in offshore wind energy investments and uncertainty surrounding [government] policy\". Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew's clean energy programme, said: \"National policy matters - investment follows policy. We've seen that again and again.\" Overall, global clean technology investment reached a record $243bn (£152bn) last year. Cuttino said it was a landmark, as this was the first year in which investment in renewable energy overtook nuclear power. \"This was a big year,\" she said. \"Now it's about keeping up that momentum.\" But there was disappointment that the UK had not performed better. Meg Hillier, shadow energy and climate spokeswoman, said: \"If we do not move fast we will slip back even further, and companies will shut up shop here or go abroad.\" Ruth Davis, chief policy adviser at Greenpeace, added: \"The Conservatives came to power promising to end dithering on energy decisions but instead investors face a continuing atmosphere of uncertainty. With long delays in setting up the green investment bank, further dilly-dallying over when it will be able to function as a proper bank, and a green leal [project to insulate homes] with no sense of direction, we've had a year of delays and broken promises. In the mean time green investment elsewhere has surged ahead so we're losing jobs and industries to other countries. Unless [David] Cameron gives a direct instruction to his Treasury to stop sabotaging his ambitions for the low-carbon economy, British businesses will continue to lose out.\" Ahead of the Cabinet discussion, a group of 10 major UK companies including Unilever, Kingfisher, Tesco, Thames Water, EDF Energy and Shell, brought together by the Prince of Wales' corporate leaders group on climate change, have written to the prime minister, urging him to take a stand. \"This target is only credible if there are the right policies and milestones in place to ensure we take adequate action to achieve it between now and 2050. We therefore support the Committee on Climate Change's call for steady progress towards that goal along a clear trajectory, and would welcome the adoption of a strong fourth carbon budget consistent with a 2030 milestone of at least 60% reductions, and with the proposals in the EU's 2050 low-carbon roadmap.\" They also called for more international action on greenhouse gas emissions from sectors such as aviation and shipping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/11/tsunami-too-big-beat-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-11T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Is the tsunami too big to beat? | Bill McGuire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/tsunami-too-big-beat-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/11/tsunami-too-big-beat-japan","fields":{"headline":"Is the tsunami too big to beat?","bodyText":"It was chilling to see the aerial footage of the debris-laden tsunami sweeping across the flat, featureless landscape of eastern Honshu. Its staggering power has done untold damage to lives and property. Natural hazards, which I study, take on a wide variety of forms, all of which have the potential to cause mayhem on a biblical scale. Generally, though, their impact affects a single city or region. But great underwater earthquakes are very different. When they are as big as the quake that struck off the northeast coast of Japan – at magnitude 8.9 the largest ever recorded there – and shallow, so that a large part of the energy released jolts the sea above, they are capable of transporting death and destruction to places far removed from the earthquake source. Just over six years ago, tsunamis transmitted the energy released in the Sumatran earthquake as far afield as Thailand, Sri Lanka and east Africa, killing tens of thousands too far away to have even felt the earth shake. As I write, waves of destruction are heading across the Pacific towards Hawaii and beyond. The sheer scale and extent of big tsunamis are sufficient to make even the most optimistic hazard scientist or emergency manager stop and think. Are some natural phenomena simply too big to plan for or cope with? There is always something we can do to mitigate or manage the impact of a natural hazard – be it an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood or tsunami. It is just that some are harder to tackle. For active volcanoes we can track the warning signs – such as ground swelling – that tell us that an eruption is on its way, and get people out of the area. Although we still cannot predict them, we can make earthquakes far less lethal by making buildings \"life safe\" – in other words, ensuring that they are engineered so as to remain reasonably intact during the strongest shaking. With floods we can build defences and make sure that homes and vital infrastructure are not built in the flood plains. With tsunamis, however, reducing their potential for serious damage and loss of life is a far harder challenge. Barriers can be constructed to protect critical facilities, such as refineries or nuclear power plants, but you can't surround entire ocean basins with concrete. Warning systems are fundamental, and the Pacific tsunami warning system, based in Hawaii, played a crucial role in alerting nations across the Pacific to the fact that yesterday's tsunami was on its way. But it is likely that any tsunami will reach those who live in coastal communities close to the earthquake source long before the warning does. Ultimately we are constantly engaged in asymmetric conflict with nature, where we will often be on the losing side. But thankfully we are never entirely powerless. In the case of the tsunami threat, we can save lives in future events through education of populations living close to submarine faults that have records of spawning big waves. One of these lies off the Sumatran coast, adjacent to the heavily populated city of Padang, where a timely self-evacuation when the ground shakes could save tens of thousands of lives at some point in the future. On the other hand, reducing the destructive power of tsunamis is close to being a lost cause. Mangroves and tree plantations can help to some degree by breaking up the incoming flood, but no one who has seen the immense power and momentum of the Japanese tsunami can be under any illusion that these would have made much of a difference. The reality is that we can only do so much, and sometimes that is simply not enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/10/arctic-struggle-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-10T21:59:01Z","webTitle":"Prepare for Arctic struggle as climate changes, US navy warned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/10/arctic-struggle-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/10/arctic-struggle-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Prepare for Arctic struggle as climate changes, US navy warned","bodyText":"America urgently needs to build up its military readiness in the Arctic where melting summer sea ice is setting up a global struggle for resources, a study prepared for the US navy has warned. The report by the National Academy of Sciences warned that climate change could upset the delicate security balance in the Arctic – even among close allies – and that America is unprepared for the challenges ahead. \"The US military as a whole has lost most of its competence in cold-weather operations for Arctic weather,\" the report, National Security Implications of Climate Change for US Naval Forces, warned. \"In the immediate term, the navy should begin Arctic training and the marine corps should also establish a cold weather training programme.\" The report warned that America was currently unprepared to defend its interests in the Arctic. Current submarine sytems would be challenged to operate in the Arctic, the report warned. In addition, the coastguard has just three ice breakers, and these are old and obsolete. It went on to call on the navy to develop an Arctic observer and research service, with remote sensing equipment such as satellites and drones. \"Even the most moderate predicted trends in climate change will present new national security challenges for the US navy, marine corps, and coastguard,\" said Frank Bowman, a retired US navy admiral and co-chair of the committee that produced the report. \"Naval forces need to monitor more closely and start preparing now for projected challenges climate change will present in the future,\" Bowman said. The report said that it expected large stretches of the Arctic to be ice-free in the summer by 2030, if current rates of ice loss continued. Competition for oil and gas in the region was bound to increase, the report said. Last year, Scottish oil producer Cairn Energy confirmed it had found oil off the coast of Greenland and one of Nato's senior commanders warned the race for resources could lead to conflict. \"The geopolitical situation in the Arctic region has become complex and nuanced, despite the area being essentially ignored since the end of the Cold War,\" the report warns. Between them, the countries sharing the Arctic, which include the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, Iceland, Sweden and Finland, have a number of unresolved disputes – over boundaries as well as resources, the report warned. Although the report acknowledged the potential for conflict in the Arctic was low, it warned: \"Co-operation in the Arctic should not be considered a given even among close allies.\" The report, four years in the making, reflects growing concern in US military and strategic circles about the security implications of climate change. In addition to the looming security challenges in the Arctic, the report warned that $100bn in navy installations were at risk from rising sea levels. All three branches of the US military have been looking at ways to get off oil – through testing biofuels on jet fighters or deploying solar technology in combat zones such as Afghanistan. The navy has adopted a goal of deriving only 50% of its energy from fossil fuels by 2020. Much of the other half will come from nuclear power, though the navy has also committed to buying stocks of camelina, a crop like canola. One prime motivator of the switch is cost, and the volatility oil prices. \"For every dollar the price of a barrel of oil goes up, the navy spends $31m more for fuel,\" the navy secretary, Ray Mabus, told a seminar this month. \"Our dependence on fossil fuels creates strategic, operational and tactical vulnerabilities for our forces.\" The army and marines have also long been concerned that fuel convoys are highly vulnerable to roadside bombs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/18/china-low-carbon-leadership-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-18T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"China's low-carbon leadership headlines fail to capture the reality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/18/china-low-carbon-leadership-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/18/china-low-carbon-leadership-claims","fields":{"headline":"China's low-carbon leadership headlines fail to capture the reality","bodyText":"It is now common to hear claims that China has \"caught up\" with the world's leading economies. Last month, the Pew Environment Group put China at the top of its clean energy investment rankings for 2010. Investment in China reached $54bn, with Germany in second place ($41bn) and the US in third ($34bn). In a similar vein, the Royal Society recently published data showing that China is set to overtake the US in academic publications by 2013 if current trends continue. But what lies behind these headlines? Do these indicators show that China is really taking the lead so quickly in the clean technology race – or are such claims premature? Our recent research with Tsinghua University on low-carbon innovation in China has spent the past year examining this question. It has found a more mixed picture than the headlines suggest. China's rapid rise is not in doubt. GDP has been increasing at around 10% a year for more than two decades. Alongside this, the environmental side effects of growth have caused significant concern. This has led to a series of targets for energy efficiency and the development of non-fossil energy sources. The energy intensity target for the 11th five-year plan aimed for a 20% reduction between 2006 and 2010. The target was just about met, but not without panic by provincial officials who implemented power cuts in some areas. Targets for individual low-carbon technologies have repeatedly been revised upwards as development outstripped expectations. Wind power growth has caught particular attention - with capacity rising from 13 gigawatts (GW) in 2008 to 42GW in 2010 (equivalent to half the power plant capacity in the UK). China is the world's largest user of solar hot water systems, and its subsidies for alternative fuel vehicles are substantial. There are ambitious plans to increase nuclear power capacity from the current 10GW to 80GW by 2020. In the light of the Fukushima accident, this now seems unrealistic – and plans are on hold pending a review. Discussions of technology deployment can only take us so far in understanding China's low-carbon position. With respect to technology development and manufacturing, the picture is more complex. In some technologies such as wind power, the headlines appear to be broadly right. Homegrown wind turbine manufacturers such as Goldwind and Sinovel are now amongst the world's top five, though questions remain about their ability to move into advanced offshore wind technologies. But wind power policy in China also has some weaknesses. According to the Worldwatch Institute, around one-third of China's wind power projects have trouble connecting to the grid. Developers have rushed to build new capacity, but with insufficient consideration of how their power would be distributed. In other areas, our research found significant gaps. In electric vehicles, Chinese companies complain that they do not have independent capabilities in key technologies and systems. In coal-fired power, domestic manufacturers are rapidly increasing efficiency to international levels. Some independent innovation has been achieved, for example in technologies which produce synthetic gas from coal. But many technologies used in the most advanced plants are still licensed from firms in OECD countries. China's most efficient coal-fired power plant at Waigaoqiao was built using technology owned by two European firms. China is also experimenting with carbon capture and storage technologies. These technologies are often seen as essential if carbon emissions from China are to be reduced over the long term. The recent Clean Energy Ministerial called for stronger international action to develop these technologies. However, the possibility that China might take the lead here seems unrealistic. In this power-hungry country, most utilities are put off by the 25% loss in efficiency required to power the carbon capture equipment. China is emerging as a major economic force no doubt, but some claims about technological leadership are premature. They serve as useful warnings to governments and firms in the OECD that the technological gap is closing fast. But they do not adequately capture the current reality. They fail to make a distinction between the deployment of cleaner technologies such as wind power in China, and the extent to which this represents genuine technological leadership. They also fail to account for the vast differences between low-carbon technologies in China – in performance, capabilities and levels of investment. • Jim Watson is a professor at the University of Sussex and Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/cbi-government-progress-green-promises-mixed","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-19T11:14:30Z","webTitle":"Government progress on green promises is mixed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/cbi-government-progress-green-promises-mixed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/cbi-government-progress-green-promises-mixed","fields":{"headline":"Government progress on green promises is mixed","bodyText":"This is the time of year that the last of my New Year resolutions get broken. My good intentions go out of the window and my gym membership card is sacrificed for getting out our next report or responding to the latest government consultation. The world can manage with me breaking my promises to use my tennis racket more, but some resolutions need to be kept. This government has made some great green promises. They have said they understand what businesses need to grow our low-carbon economy. Now they need to deliver. Ensuring that they do so is why we introduced our climate change policy tracker. Now in its fifth edition, the biannual tracker delivers our verdict on how government policy is doing. The tracker charts progress in de-carbonising four areas: power, buildings, transport and industry. The latest edition offers the first detailed look at how the coalition has done. So what did we find? Of the 13 indicators we have, one is green showing progress is on track (nuclear power), three are red for little progress (homes, buildings and industry) and nine are amber showing good ambition but insufficient delivery. The biggest threat the tracker highlights is that changes to our planning regulations could dissuade investors from putting in the money needed to low-carbon energy ideas. There are still 37 energy infrastructure projects awaiting a decision, inherited from the previous government. These include wind farms, nuclear and gas-fired power stations, which are essential for delivering a balanced and sustainable energy mix. Of course, it's not all doom and gloom. We are beginning to see the government's plans for the green economy appearing in the chamber. There are some good ideas appearing that deservedly have cross-party consensus, but there is still much to get right. The issue is ensuring changes such as, electricity market reform and the green deal fit with other policy areas and understanding that climate change doesn't fit into one neat policy box. It affects all areas of our lives, so it must be considered in all parts of the government. That is what the tracker looks at. As for what the government needs to do next, we have a clear set of priorities for next six months: • Clearing the backlog of delayed planning applications, finalise electricity market reform plans • Supporting investors with a prompt national planning statement on energy • Changing the carbon reduction commitment to incentivise energy efficiency among companies • Approving the first carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration project • Ensuring long-term incentives for the success of electric vehicles beyond 2012 • Clarifying the details of the green deal to ensure it will stimulate consumer demand To track government's progress on green initiatives click here.

The prime minister said it was important to \"engage\" with Pakistan and deal with the extremists rather than \"throw up one's hands in despair\" because the stronger the country's democracy, the more it would work with international partners to combat terrorism. He urged co-operation with Pakistan on security matters, with his comments coming as the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, dismissed claims that his country harboured Bin Laden as \"baseless speculation\" amid disbelief that the authorities were unaware that al-Qaida's leader had been living in an area full of soldiers and close to the country's top military academy. Cameron said the death of Bin Laden presented several opportunities: to make further aggressive moves against the rest of al-Qaida and defeat the network, to tell the Taliban to \"separate itself\" from al-Qaida and recognise that insurgency was not the answer and also to say to Pakistan that now was the moment to \"really prove\" it wants to combat terrorism. Cameron – who sparked a furious diplomatic row with Pakistan last year after accusing the country of looking \"both ways\" on terrorism – said that, while many questions needed to be answered, it was in Britain's interest to back democratic forces within Pakistan. Cameron, who spoke to Zardari and Pakistan's prime minister, Yusuf Raza Gilani, on Monday evening, described the two men as \"staunch\" in their fight against security threats and said they had done \"huge amounts\" to try and combat both terrorism and extremism. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"There are lots of questions that have to be asked but, in terms of the political leadership of that country, both of whom I spoke to yesterday, what they say ... is that, as far as they were concerned, Bin Laden was a foreigner who had no business being in Pakistan, who brought nothing but misery to their country. That is their strong view.\" Describing Pakistan as a country that has suffered more at the hands of terrorism \"than any other country on earth\", Cameron said he saw his role as making a \"big choice\" for Britain. \"We could, of course, go down the route of having a massive row with Pakistan,\" he said. \"I assess our relationship with Pakistan and it is my very clear view that it is in our interest to work with the government and the people of Pakistan to combat terrorism and extremism, to help with development in that country. \"If we turn away from it and give up on it and say this is all too difficult and complicated because we don't always get what we want, you are left with a nuclear power in danger of massive extremism and massive instability which completely would not be in our interest.\" Zardari denied that Pakistan \"lacked vitality\" in its fight against terrorism, pointing out that his country was \"perhaps the world's greatest victim of terrorism\". Cameron said the death of Bin Laden was \"clearly a helpful development\" in terms of the military campaign in Afghanistan, but would not necessarily speed the UK's exit. \"I don't think it will necessarily change any timetables, but we should use it as an opportunity to say to the Taliban: now is the time to separate yourself from al-Qaida, to give up your weapons, to accept the basic tenets of the Afghan constitution.\" But there were \"many more steps\" to take towards a political solution, he warned. The prime minister, who chaired a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday night and will brief MPs in the Commons later on Tuesday, said ministers and officials were making sure all possible intelligence was being gathered \"and that we are taking every step to keep people in our country safe\". He compared the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, with Bin Laden, saying both men \"hate the idea of democracy taking hold in the Arab world\". It was important to exploit the connection by ensuring the success of the uprisings in north Africa and the Middle East, he said. The foreign office minister, Alistair Burt, said people should apply \"common sense\" and to consult the Foreign Office website before travelling amid fears of reprisal attacks. Asked to comment on the threat to the UK, Burt told BBC Breakfast: \"We have not needed to change the general threat level to UK citizens, but it is just a matter of common sense at the moment. \"There might be places that they would avoid in terms of large crowds, potential demonstrations and things like that. \"We are trying to be sensible and cautious in the light of events yesterday. There is a concern that there might be some form of reprisal, so we have heightened the security around all our embassies and consulates around the world, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan, but we have nothing to indicate a specific threat.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/may/03/russia-arctic-nuclear-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-02T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Russia to build floating Arctic nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/03/russia-arctic-nuclear-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/may/03/russia-arctic-nuclear-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"Russia to build floating Arctic nuclear stations","bodyText":"Russia is planning a fleet of floating and submersible nuclear power stations to exploit Arctic oil and gas reserves, causing widespread alarm among environmentalists. A prototype floating nuclear power station being constructed at the SevMash shipyard in Severodvinsk is due to be completed next year. Agreement to build a further four was reached between the Russian state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, and the northern Siberian republic of Yakutiya in February. The 70-megawatt plants, each of which would consist of two reactors on board giant steel platforms, would provide power to Gazprom, the oil firm which is also Russia's biggest company. It would allow Gazprom to power drills needed to exploit some of the remotest oil and gas fields in the world in the Barents and Kara seas. The self-propelled vessels would store their own waste and fuel and would need to be serviced only once every 12 to 14 years. In addition, designers are known to have developed submarine nuclear-powered drilling rigs that could allow eight wells to be drilled at a time. Bellona, a leading Scandinavian environmental watchdog group, yesterday condemned the idea of using nuclear power to open the Arctic to oil, gas and mineral production. \"It is highly risky. The risk of a nuclear accident on a floating power plant is increased. The plants' potential impact on the fragile Arctic environment through emissions of radioactivity and heat remains a major concern. If there is an accident, it would be impossible to handle,\" said Igor Kudrik, a spokesman. Environmentalists also fear that if additional radioactive waste is produced, it will be dumped into the sea. Russia has a long record of polluting the Arctic with radioactive waste. Countries including Britain have had to offer Russia billions of dollars to decommission more than 160 nuclear submarines, but at least 12 nuclear reactors are known to have been dumped, along with more than 5,000 containers of solid and liquid nuclear waste, on the northern coast and on the island of Novaya Zemlya. The US Geological Survey believes the Arctic holds up to 25% of the world's undiscovered oil and gas reserves, leading some experts to call the region the next Saudi Arabia. But sea ice, strong winds and temperatures that can dip to below -50C have made them technologically impossible to exploit. Russia, Norway, Denmark, Canada and the US have all claimed large areas of the Arctic in the past five years. Russian scientists used a mini-submarine to plant a flag below the North Pole in 2007 and have claimed that a nearby underwater ridge is part of its continental shelf. Last week, ministers from many Arctic countries heard scientists and former US vice-president and Nobel prize winner Al Gore say that the Arctic could be free of ice in the summer within five years, with drastic consequences for the world's climate and human health. But many countries bordering the Arctic see climate change as the chance to exploit areas that were once inaccessible and to open trade routes between the Pacific and Atlantic. According to a new report by the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum, Russia is considering other nuclear plants for power-hungry settlements. \"The locations that have been discussed include 33 towns in the Russian far north and far east. Such plants could be also used to supply energy for oil and gas extraction,\" says the report by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/02/parents-revolt-radiation-levels","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-02T15:43:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima parents dish the dirt in protest over radiation levels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/parents-revolt-radiation-levels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/02/parents-revolt-radiation-levels","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima parents dish the dirt in protest over radiation levels","bodyText":"Furious parents in Fukushima have delivered a bag of radioactive playground earth to education officials in protest at moves to weaken nuclear safety standards in schools. Children can now be exposed to 20 times more radiation than was previously permissible. The new regulations have prompted outcry. A senior adviser resigned and the prime minister, Naoto Kan, was criticised by politicians from his own party. Ministers have defended the increase in the acceptable safety level from 1 to 20 millisieverts per year as a necessary measure to guarantee the education of hundreds of thousands of children in Fukushima prefecture, location of the nuclear plant that suffered a partial meltdown and several explosions after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. It is estimated that 75% of Fukushima's schools may have radiation levels above the old safety level of 1 millisievert. The local authorities in Koriyama have tried to ease the problem by digging up the top layer of soil in school and day centre playgrounds, but residents near the proposed dump site have objected. The new standard of 20 millisieverts a year – equivalent to the annual maximum dose for German nuclear workers – will mean those schools remain open, but parents and nuclear opponents are angry that safety concerns are being ignored. A group claiming to represent 250 parents in Fukushima visited the upper house of parliament and presented government officials with a bag of radioactive dirt from the playground of one of the affected schools. A geiger counter clicked over it with a reading of 38 microsieverts per hour. \"How dare they tell us it is safe for our children,\" said Sachiko Satou of the Protect Fukushima Children from Radiation Association. \"This is disgusting. They can't play outside with such risks. If the government won't remove the radioactive dirt then we'll do it ourselves and dump it outside the headquarters of Tokyo Electric.\" Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and other environment and anti-nuclear groups submitted a petition against the regulations. They accused the Nuclear Safety Commission of meekly accepting the new safety limit after just two hours of closed-door discussions with government officials. However, representatives of the commission denied agreeing that 20 millisieverts was safe. Education ministry officials fudged demands for an explanation. \"I think 20 millisieverts is safe but I don't think it's good,\" said Itaru Watanabe of the education ministry, drawing howls of derision from the audience of participants. He promised the government would carefully monitor the situation and do all it could to get radioactivity down to 1 millisievert. The health impacts are disputed. Physicians for Social Responsibility – a US-based Nobel prize winning organisation that opposes nuclear power – said children were more vulnerable than adults. It said the new acceptable limit exposed children to a one in 200 risk of getting cancer, compared with a one in 500 risk for adults. \"It is unconscionable to increase the allowable dose for children to 20 millisieverts,\" the group said in a statement. \"There is no way this level of exposure can be considered safe.\" This is not the first time the government has shifted safety baselines since the start of the crisis. Permissible levels of radiation exposure for nuclear workers were amended soon after the disaster struck to allow emergency operations at the stricken Fukushima reactor. Several weeks later the cabinet allowed the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric, to violate regulations by dumping 11,500 tonnes of contaminated water into the Pacific. The radioactivity of the discharge was 100 times higher than the acceptable limit. The government says it has to take unprecedented measures to deal with an unprecedented disaster. Kan has lost one of his chief scientific advisers over the latest decision. Toshiso Kosako – a Tokyo University professor who was called in to help deal with the crisis – walked out on Friday and has since accused the government of ad hoc policy making and contravening internationally accepted norms for the sake of political expediency. Kan has also come under fire from lawmakers in his ruling Democratic party. Mori Yuko, an upper house member, said she was disgusted by the decision to loosen the safety limit. \"Would politicians and bureaucrats allow their own children to go to a contaminated school,\" she said. \"This makes me furious.\" She called for more rigorous and widespread health monitoring of children and criticised an earlier government policy to withhold data about radiation levels and wind direction. After a public outcry these figures are now published daily in newspapers, but the allegations of cover-ups and shifting safety baselines are taking a heavy political toll. A mere 1.3% of respondents in a weekend poll by the Kyodo news agency thought Kan was exercising sufficient leadership. But many people also criticise the main opposition Liberal Democratic party for lax nuclear regulation while it was in power. • This article was amended on 6 May 2011. In the original, the schoolyard soil sample collected by parent-protesters was said to give a reading of 38 millisieverts.

The inquiry by the Planning Inspectorate will hear an appeal by Augean, a hazardous waste specialist company, which wants to put rubble, soil and other low-radioactive waste – mostly from nuclear power stations – into a landfill site near Peterborough, Northamptonshire. The battle over the site at Kings Cliffe is being seen as a test case for the rest of the country, as a growing number of waste companies hope to take advantage of the government's change of rules to allow such dumping to take place. The Environment Agency (EA), which has already said it was \"minded to grant the authorisation\", is also considering applications from two other firms with sites in Lancashire and Cumbria, and others are expected in future to cope with the huge increase in waste generated by decommissioning the UK's older nuclear power stations over the coming years. Augean said that the waste it wanted to dispose of was mostly soil and rubble from ancillary buildings on decommissioned nuclear sites, plus waste from other sources such as hospitals and university research laboratories. In a statement it added: \"It is important to note that this construction waste contains only very small amounts of radiation, which present negligible risk to the public and, importantly, to Augean's staff on site. At this level, the waste involved is less than 1% of the average exposure experienced by the public from natural sources in Northamptonshire and across the country.\" In future, the government's policy would save taxpayers \"billions of pounds\", added the company. However protest groups say they are not reassured by promises of \"best practice\" - which have been given before in other safety critical situations, and later found to be flawed. Clare Langan, a member of the opposition group Kings Cliffe Waste Watchers, said they were particularly worried about contamination by dust in the air, and by waste leaking out of the landfill pit into an aquifer underneath and the soil around. The group also plans to tell the inquiry that there is strong local opposition - in contradiction of the government's declared policy of disposing of nuclear waste where there is community support. \"One of the things we want to make sure is if they lose here they don't go away and do it somewhere else,\" added Langan. \"There's got to be a proper policy, rather than ad hoc dumping it in rural landfill.\" An EA spokesperson said: \"We will not authorise a site for landfill disposal of LLW [low level waste] unless we are satisfied that the wastes proposed for disposal are safe.\" Until now almost all nuclear waste has been stored in special depositories, including low level radioactive waste in the Drigg low level waste (LLW) repository in Cumbria, run by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a government agency. Following concerns that Drigg was filling up and an expensive way to store the least radioactive, high volume waste, especially with the upcoming decommissioning programme for nuclear reactors closing in the next decade, the previous Labour government changed the rules in 2007 to allow such material to be put into landfill sites, subject to permission from the Environment Agency and, where necessary, the local planning authority. The new rules put a limit on total public radiation exposures of 0.3 millisieverts (mSv2) per year, and said that \"in most cases we would expect them to be no greater than 0.02 mSv per year\". This compares to average UK doses from all sources, including natural background and medical exposures of about 2.6 mSv per year, says the EA. Nationally, low level waste makes up 90% of nuclear waste by volume, but in total contains less than one-thousandth of 1% of the radioactivity, said the NDA. The planning inquiry, to be held in Corby until 12 November, follows a decision in March by Northamptonshire council to reject Augean's application for the Kings Cliffe site, despite a recommendation for approval by the council's planning officers and support from the Environment Agency. Augean said it appealed the decision because \"we believe that the refusal was not based on sound scientific or planning policy grounds\". It added: \"We are confident that our application will stand up to the close scrutiny of the inquiry and that such a thorough examination will dispel concerns and provide greater confidence to the local community of the appropriateness and safety of these proposals.\" In August the NDA issued a new strategy for low level waste, including advice that companies must focus on reducing nuclear waste and disposal was the \"last resort\" option."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/04/barnsley-byelection-lib-dems-result","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-04T19:30:01Z","webTitle":"The Libs are not the Dems | Tim Horton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/04/barnsley-byelection-lib-dems-result","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/04/barnsley-byelection-lib-dems-result","fields":{"headline":"The Libs are not the Dems","bodyText":"It's perhaps unsurprising that prominent Liberal Democrats have dismissed the party's woeful byelection result in Barnsley, a fall from 2nd to 6th, as inevitable voter discontent towards a government bravely taking tough decisions. But deep down, they know this isn't what's going on. Entering coalition with the Tories has exposed the deep ideological splits within the Lib Dems. And driven by feelings of betrayal, millions of progressive voters will no longer countenance them as a repository for their support. It may yet be possible for the Lib Dems to ride out the storm and regroup again in opposition. But if the future lies in repeated bouts of coalition government, the time may well be nearing when the only tenable option is to split into their liberal and social democratic wings once more. It's worth asking whether, by the next parliament, they expect to be one party or two. The Liberal-SDP merger made a great deal of sense in the polarisation of the 1980s. But then along came the popular Tony Blair of the 1990s. New Labour fitted smack between these two Lib Dem tribes – more confident in the power of the state than the Liberals, more at ease with market reforms than the SDP. This made the divisions between these two strains of liberal thought hugely significant. Tensions have also been exacerbated by David Cameron's skilful pitch to liberal voters who do not care for social democracy. It's not the Lib Dems' fault this happened. But the understandable desire to sustain themselves as a single entity has led at times to a less-than-honest politics, which is now unravelling fast. A large amount of their 2010 election platform chose to advertise decidedly leftish values – no deep cuts, more equality, a strong welfare state – even though the Liberal camp at the top of the party always wanted to throw its hat in with the Tories. Why people are so angry with the Lib Dems is not because they have had to make policy compromises, but because they seem to have reneged on these key values. Political parties entering coalitions often have to compromise, but tend to be constrained in doing so by a core set of stated principles. Many voters don't think that happened this time round. That's also why the Tories have survived relatively unscathed. Yes, they have broken many pre-election promises, but they have broken promises in a way that voters understand is nevertheless entirely consistent with their underlying values. By contrast, fairly or unfairly, voters see the Lib Dems as having gone against their values. And as Gordon Brown found out over the abolition of the 10p tax rate, it can be hard to recover from that. Worse still for the Lib Dems, they chose to sell many of their pre-election positions in absolutist terms. Tuition fees, control orders, nuclear power: all of these, we were told, were morally wrong. This attracted many voters from Labour. But those same voters don't take well to pragmatic compromise. A Lib Dem split would be painful, but transformative. A liberated Liberal party could develop a coherent agenda to genuinely challenge the Tories on the centre-right. Meanwhile, many social-liberals would like to work constructively with Ed Miliband's Labour (rather than having to parrot attack lines they don't agree with). And Labour tribalists must be challenged to work across party boundaries too. Some Lib Dem MPs seem to believe they can continue projecting a dual identity, arguing publicly against welfare cuts at the same time as supporting them in parliament. But the time is soon coming when many in the party will have to choose. Barnsley is famous for its coal mines. This week the Lib Dem canary emerged gasping for life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/nov/03/scientists-answer-energy-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-03T13:38:58Z","webTitle":"Scientists answer Guardian readers' toughest energy questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/03/scientists-answer-energy-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/nov/03/scientists-answer-energy-questions","fields":{"headline":"Scientists answer Guardian readers' toughest energy questions","bodyText":"Last week we asked you to put your toughest energy questions to nine world-leading energy scientists. You responded with more than 350 serious and searching questions on everything from renewable energy to nuclear power. Here are 10 of the best questions, answered by the awards committee of nine scientists on the Global Energy prize. 1. Could we support our current western lifestyle with only \"renewable\" energy? Asked by Jim Burks José Goldemberg answers: Presently \"renewable\" energy accounts for approximately 10% of the energy consumed in Europe. The impressive growth of energy produce from windmills, biomass and other renewables indicates that renewables as a whole could account for \"circa\" 50% of all energy consumed by 2050. The present western lifestyle requires the energy equivalent of three tonnes of petroleum per year. Improving the efficiency of energy use (with more efficient automobiles, refrigerators and other end-use appliances as well as better home insulation) could reduce that amount by at least 30%. As is well known considerable efficiency gains have already been achieved in the OECD countries since 1973. Present energy consumption would be 50% higher than it is actually without them. That reduction could give renewables a better chance to replace fossil fuels. 2. Do you agree with the US Joint Forces Command (JFC) that spare capacity in global oil production may very well disappear in 2012 and a shortfall of 10m barrels per day develop by 2015? NoSurrenderMonkey (and others) Clement Bowman: The word 'may' in the question, and the multiple use of the word \"could\" in the energy summary statement of the US JFC document, obliges one to accept the possibility that \"yes it could\". However, I believe that it is highly unlikely that there will be significant oil shortages over the next few decades. Once there is a perceived gap, forces come into play that cause the gap to be filled. Here are some of the likely forces. Even modest increases in oil prices will convert unproven resources into recoverable reserves. Action on energy efficiency has finally taken hold in response to the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. New pipelines are under construction or planned in North America that will bring crude oil to refineries that have unused capacity. The enormous quantities of shale gas that have been discovered will provide part of the energy mix. The Canadian oil sands are just starting to ramp up with new more environmentally acceptable insitu recovery technology. China and India will use a combination of more efficient coal technology, nuclear energy and renewables to help meet their accelerating demand for energy. When I entered the oil industry in the 1960s, the conventional wisdom was that there was only 10 years of oil supply left. Predictions have a habit of failing. 3. The world's population is due to rise to 9 billion people. Can the planet supply the energy needed to achieve that end? ken brookes Tom Blees: Widespread predictions that energy demand will double by mid-century to meet the needs of an expected 9-10 billion humans are, I believe, too conservative. Billions of people rely on now-shrinking glaciers for much of their water supply, with many areas of the world already lacking adequate water. Increasing human numbers by 50% means that we will have to provide most of the water for some billions of people primarily with desalination, an energy-intensive process. Add to that the fact that the majority of people in the world today use a fraction of the energy used by those in developed countries, and one could easily anticipate at least a tripling of demand in developing countries as they strive to improve their standard of living. In the book Prescription for the Planet, I explained how a doubling of energy supply could easily be accomplished by 2050 at a rate of deployment even less ambitious than the French employed as they converted to nuclear power in the 1970s and 80s. Given the ability to factory-produce fast reactors of the type described here, a concerted global effort to meet mid-century energy demands should be quite within reach. The fuel is already available and - for all intents and purposes - virtually free. 4. I'm 25 years old. What's your best case scenario for the world's energy supply mix when I'm 75? What's your worst case scenario? And where you you think we'll actually be? Ian Bullock Tom Blees: While there's widespread agreement that fossil fuels must eventually be abandoned, there seems to be no consensus on which technologies can be expected to take their place. The contenders already available run the gamut from some of the most diffuse energy sources (wind, sunlight) to the most energy-dense. While nearly all of the latter systems currently in use consist of light-water nuclear reactors, fast reactors can extract well over 100 times more energy from uranium, and are seen by most nuclear prognosticators as being the inevitable successors to light-water reactors and the solution to the looming global energy crisis. All of the energy a person in a developed country today can be expected to use in a lifetime - for electricity, transportation, heating and cooling, and the energy that goes into producing all that they will consume - could be supplied by a single piece of depleted uranium the size of half a ping-pong ball. Despite all the controversy over competing technologies today, this amazing fact - plus the fact that it can supply all that energy safely and without harm to the environment - should eventually carry the day, leaving other energy sources as bit players on the world stage. 5. Is energy storage - ie battery technology - one of the biggest things holding back renewables and widespread energy efficiency? Look at the intermittancy of wind power, the requirements of a \"smart grid city\", electric cards etc - surely decent energy storage could transform the economics of these industries. And when might/how the problem be solved? Mago Salas (and others) Alvin Trivelpiece: An excellent source of technical information regarding batteries is the Wikipedia site. Even so, it does not answer the implicit theme of the question. Namely, why not large-scale energy storage in batteries to capture energy from intermittent sources such as wind or solar for use at times when the energy is required by a consumer? The use of batteries for energy storage is a matter of the application and its need for a source of energy. Standard small batteries for toys and other convenience devices such as flashlights are examples where the cost per kilowatt-hour is irrelevant. The consumer pays the asking price and discards them without additional cost. Some solar applications using battery storage make great sense. Remote applications in the middle of desert where the cost of transmission lines is greater than the cost of a solar panel with some battery storage system. Same reasoning applies for spacecraft applications. For other applications, the three laws of thermodynamics and the rules of economics must be taken into account. A simplified version of thermodynamics is: (1) You can't win, (2) You can't even break even, and (3) You can't get out of the game. This means that you have to take all costs from cradle to grave into account and see if you make money selling the energy at competitive price. If you can do this without any subsidy, then you don't have a sustainable situation. Unfortunately, when this is done for batteries, with all factors taken into account, it doesn't seem to come out favorably. That is, taking into account the cost of the raw materials including whatever environmental remediation might be needed, the transport of these materials to the location where fabrication takes place, cost of fabrication and distribution, the cost of disposing of the batteries, including the cost of maintenance during their useful life, etc. Any energy storage or distribution scheme that doesn't make net energy, without subsidies, is not likely to be sustainable. Subsidies are a good way to get some products developed and deployed, but at some point it is usually assumed that the subsidy can eventually be eliminated, or justified on some non-economic basis. 6. How far away is nuclear fusion? Is it a realistic goal? Mischa Hewitt (and others) Robert Aymar: There is a popular view that fusion energy has been just over the horizon for decades and it has failed to deliver. This is false. Fusion has always been a long-term project; scientific progress in magnetic confinement of plasmas has been impressive and quantitative performances, achieved in the successive experiments, have from 1975 done better than the well known Moore's law of digital technologies. On this ground, seven among the largest countries in the world ( China, Europe, India, Japan, Russia, South-Korea, US) have decided on the strategy to pursue the development of fusion through international collaboration and are building together the large facility, called \"ITER\", the first burning plasma to produce after 2025 half a gigawatt of fusion power. This device , a physics experiment and an experimental reactor, should demonstrate the scientific feasibility of fusion as an energy source; it should validate and optimise the parameters and develop the technologies for the following strategical step, an electricity generating demonstration reactor to evaluate economics of fusion, before a commercial power reactor can be designed. Each of these steps requires around 40 years for its design, construction and enough operation time to capitalise on its results. Unless there is an urgency to provide a faster track (and pay for more risk), it is unreasonable to assume a sensible amount of fusion generated electricity in the grid before the middle of this century. The need for new energy sources by the end of the century is undisputed. Besides coal burning plants, with total sequestration of the CO2 produced, large electrical power plants will possibly rely only on nuclear fission or fusion. Magnetic fusion has many appealing features (unlimited fuel reserve, safety and environmental characteristics), and from present analysis, its potential for energy generation is real and ITER will bring an experimental confirmation. 7. Why has tidal energy not been employed on a large scale (similar to hydro) anywhere in the world ? Is it down to cost or lack of efficiency? The Doc (and others) Klaus Riedle: Tidal power differs from other renewable sources, in that it offers predictable though still intermittent power with decent power densities at certain preferred locations like estuaries or tide channels. One of the main barriers to large scale use is the cost of the back-up needed due to the intermittency. Tidal range technologies make use of large tide differences by blocking off an estuary or forming a tidal lagoon and using a conventional water turbine in the dam to generate power from the tides going in and out, much like in a river. A large plant in Brittany, La Rance, has been operating successfully since 1966. Specific cost can be taken from planned projects on the Severn, which have an estimated 120-year lifespan, with commercial discount rates to €0.1-0.2/kWh stated by the UK Sustainable Development Commission [Last month, the UK government scrapped the Severn barrage tidal project on financial grounds]. Environmental concerns, related to whether the barrage causes harm to the estuary, will be a significant obstacle to their implementation. Slowly rotating, large axial turbines make use of tide stream velocities above 1 metre per second. Like offshore windmills, such turbines are fixed to the seabed or even to masts, to be lifted out of the water for maintenance. Several prototypes have being tested in recent years; some projects around the UK are under planning. Little information so far is available about generating cost; a UK Carbon Trust study gives a range of €0.12-0.18/kWh. Environmental concerns and the impact on fishing and sea transport have to be addressed, as for offshore windfarms. As with the other renewables, public support for tidal power should go into further development and testing of prototypes allowing them to find their niche in the market, rather than continuously subsidising power generation. 8. What are the barriers in getting our reliance on oil and petrol transferred over to electricity/hydrogen? Matt Flynn Marta Bonifert: Fossil fuel reserves - like oil, petrol and coal - have been depleted quite rapidly in the recent years. This fact and the need to reduce the green house gas emissions of anthropogenic origin (global climate change) drive the business and the governmental sector to utilise renewable energy resources on a much wider scale. The transfer is not easy – there are technical, political and last but not least economical barriers. The efficiency of the new technologies has to be improved, there is a need for moderating the costs and legislation should support these new energy resources. Further more we cannot forget that oil is not only an energy resource but we use it in various forms – even in the human heart as artificial plastic valve – when needed. So it is a very complex question which has implication on the economy, the environment and the society at the same time. Electricity and hydrogen will most probably be used at larger increasing extent substituting traditional energy carriers but again the question is their resources: whether they will be produced from fossil or renewable. But there is a much easier and available solution which immediately helps to combat climate change: energy saving and energy efficiency. Changing our way of life, taking actions perceived as difficult however with a simple move – eg switching off the lights when they are not needed – we together can do a lot for the environment and the future generation. 9. Is it really possible to justify the legacy of nuclear waste for countless generations while we continue to waste electricity so carelessly, on things like flashy advertising and keeping buildings lit at night? Surely this should only be considered as a very last resort, when we have finally given up all such inessential useage of energy? greghaddock (and others) Pius N'gwandu: Something must be done now. We cannot afford to add to our plight the luxury of the proliferation of nuclear waste. Yet the evidence of the threat from nuclear waste does not show that it comes from the generation of nuclear energy. The threat rather comes from the stockpile of the arsenal of nuclear weapons accummulated by nations with such weapons. Moreover the data on the utilisation of World Energy Resources nuclear energy accounts for only 16%. With the development of nuclear science and advances in nuclear reactor technology and the international jurisprudence developed by the IAEA safeguards and safety measures have been developed for the peaceful use of nuclear power. In Africa we we have substantial uranium resources which are being mined and exported by large transnational corporations. Yet Africa suffers chronic shortages of energy which factor is a serious constraint to her development. International cooperation through the IAEA could reduce the danger for nuclear proliferation and dumping of nuclear waste by offering the latest technology in mining and mangement of thentire nuclear fuel cycle. Depleted uranium could be used to produce clean and safe energy Other uses of nuclear technology would include nuclear medicine, eradication of pests and vectors such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies which spread diseases such as malaria and tripanosomiasis (SIT). With the ominous prospects of mutual terror and extermination nations have no other rational choice but to learn fast to cooperate for the survival of the human species. Time is running out. We must move away from the self inflicted fear of nuclear energy. Let us combine knowledge, technology and the collective will to survive. Fifty years after President Eisenhower's speech on \"atoms for peace\", we must build the will to tame these atoms for peace, development and development. 10. What exactly is the carbon footprint of nuclear power (including uranium refining)? Dr Tim (and others) Tom Blees: The IPCC has studied this and put nuclear in about the same category as wind and solar. See the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report section entitled Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change. On page 293 of this report there is a chart that describes both non-biomass renewables and nuclear in terms of their carbon output as \"small amount.\" The text of the report (on page 269) states: \"Total life-cycle GHG emissions per unit of electricity produced from nuclear power are below 40 gCO2-eq/kWh (10 gC-eq/kWh), similar to those for renewable energy sources. Nuclear power is therefore an effective GHG mitigation option…\" Cynics may point out that they mention a thoroughly debunked report that claims much higher life-cycle emissions, but the IPCC clearly found it unpersuasive. It's important to note that the vast majority of CO2 emissions in the nuclear life cycle arise from uranium mining and enrichment. Deployment of integral fast reactors, however, will eliminate the need for both mining and enrichment for nearly a millennium, so the life-cycle carbon cost will be virtually nil, especially if the concrete used in the new plants is of the magnesium silicate variety that actually is carbon negative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/feb/09/nuclear-weapons-examined-commission","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-09T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons case to be examined by commission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/09/nuclear-weapons-examined-commission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/feb/09/nuclear-weapons-examined-commission","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear weapons case to be examined by commission","bodyText":"The government's decision to go ahead with a new, but as yet undefined, nuclear missile system will be subjected to unprecedented independent scrutiny by a group of senior defence, diplomatic, scientific, and political figures. The new Trident commission will be headed by the former Labour defence secretary, Lord Browne, the former Conservative defence secretary, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, and the former Lib Dem defence spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell. The government has decided to put off a decision on the shape and size of a new nuclear weapons system until 2015, as part of the coalition agreement, after the next general election is due. It also comes at a time more and more leading establishment figures, such as the former US secretary of state and national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, say they are becoming increasingly anxious about nuclear proliferation, sources involved in setting up the commission said. Other members of the group include Lord Guthrie, the former chief of defence staff, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK ambassador at the UN at the time of the invasion of Iraq, and Professor Sir Martin Rees, former Astronomer Royal and President of the Royal Society. They were all described yesterday as having an \"open mind\" about whether Britain should continue to possess nuclear weapons, and if so, how they would be delivered. \"This is the first time in a very long time that we have had a wholesale review of nuclear weapons policy\", Campbell said. He added: \"It is high time it was subjected to rigorous analysis\". Lord Browne, defence secretary at the time the Labour decided to renew Trident in 2006, said that an independent review was crucial now in light of the government's insistence that the cost of a new nuclear weapons system must come out of the core defence budget. \"No one has debated the impact of this on the rest of expenditure on defence\", he told the Guardian. In the past, spending on the nuclear deterrent was in addition to that agreed for non-nuclear weapons. Browne attacked the government for not allowing nuclear weapons to be included in its recent strategic defence review. Ian Kearns, research director of the British American Security Information Council (Basic) who proposed the new commission, said that it would be an \"open-minded look at the issue from first principles … Should the UK be a nuclear power at all and if it should, is Trident the only or best way to go about it?\" He added: \"What more can and should the government be doing to promote global nuclear disarmament in a world of growing proliferation risks?\" Kearns continued: \"Given the government's decision to delay Trident renewal until after the next election, there is an important opportunity before the country for a fresh an in-depth debate. This commission will provide a focal point for that debate\". Defence officials said that no date had yet been set for the \"initial gate\" decision for a new nuclear weapons system – the decision on the design for submarines in a new nuclear weapons system. The decision was due last year. Members of the commission will also include Lord Hennessy, professor of contemporary history at Queen Mary, University of London, and Professor Alyson Bailes, former head of the security policy department at the Foreign Office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/jul/02/boris-johnson-lbc-phone-in-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-02T15:35:20Z","webTitle":"David Cameron's EU summit statement: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jul/02/boris-johnson-lbc-phone-in-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/jul/02/boris-johnson-lbc-phone-in-live","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron's EU summit statement: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Sarah Teather, the Lib Dem former minister, has said that the government's plans make private landlords check the immigration status of their tenants are \"completely unworkable\" and will cause \"an enormous amount of misery\". (See 2.09pm.) • Theresa May, the home secretary, has launched a public consultation on police stop and search powers. • Sir Merrick Cockell, the chair of the Local Government Association, has said that the Barnett formula should be abolished so that England can get a fairer share of public spending. He made the comments in a speech calling for wholesale reform of the way local government is funded. (See 3.15pm.) • Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has told the Commons health committee that the new NHS 111 helpline service has had \"teething problems\" but that it will be retained. “Despite the controversy, I don’t think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater,\" Hunt said. \"It is a good idea.\" • David Blunkett, the Labour former cabinet minister, has said that Labour should not be seen as being in the pocket of the unions. \"We can’t have a go at the vested interest of the Tory party if we don’t clear our own house,\" he told the BBC's Daily Politics. • Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, has said the government made mistakes when it changed the way translation services were supplied in courts.\"The handling of the contraction of the translation service could have been better,\" he told MPs. \"Lessons have been learnt. However that service is now delivering a standard of delivery.\" • David Cameron has said that plans for direct peace talks with the Taliban will not \"weaken\" the resolve of UK forces in Afghanistan in any way. • Cameron has said that transitional controls will apply to Croatia following its accession to the EU, limiting for a time Croatians' right to move to the UK to work. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's an afternoon reading list. • Tim Bale lists 12 lessons for people making policy in opposition, drawn from a seminar attended by senior political policy makers. 1. Opposition is hell – but it’s also an opportunity Government is busy, busy, busy. You spend most of your time trying to implement the stuff you’ve already thought about – and that always takes much longer than you’d hoped it would. You also spend an awful lot of time simply fire-fighting. Opposition, on the other hand, is the one chance you have as a party to really re-think what you’re about and to signal that you’re striking out in a genuinely different direction. It’s also much easier to change policies when you’re out of office than when you’re in it, although the ability to do that clearly varies between parties. A Tory leader – especially one who knows where he or she wants to go and looks like a winner – has pretty much carte blanche. Labour leaders have a little less room for manoeuvre – but much more than leaders of the Lib Dems, whose democratic policy making machinery can oblige them to maintain commitments they might otherwise dump. Whatever, all parties – especially those who have just lost power and are therefore chock-full of ex-ministers determined to defend their records and wedded to their old agendas – need, at least in opposition, to be extraordinarily self-critical. • Andy Newman at Left Futures explains the row between the Labour party and Unite over the Falkirk selection. • Iain Martin at the Telegraph recalls covering Monklands East as a young reporter and says the Falkirk story may reveal the true state of Labour. Labour looks very ragged. Its membership, like Tory membership, is crumbling. The Blairites have largely disappeared and the traditional Labour Right, which some of the party’s brighter, younger MPs had hoped would reassert itself is not organising in any meaningful way. Unite is thus not engaged in a battle of equals. If Unite is taking over, it is taking over a bombed-out building. • Guido Fawkes on his blog clears up the mystery of what Boris Johnson did say at the Gay Pride event about the Arcelor. (See 9.14am.) • James Kirkup at the Telegraph says John Bercow called a Tory MP “rude”, “stupid” and “pompous” last night, and he recalls Bercow’s best outbursts against Tory MPs. Sir Merrick Cockell, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, called for wide-ranging reform to the way local government is funded in a speech to the LGA conference this afternoon. The LGA actually has a 10-point plan. You can read the details here. It includes council grants being taken out of the hands of ministers, five-year spending settlements for local government, giving councils more freedom to borrow and creating a market in municipal bonds and the merger of six government departments to create an England Office. But there were two overall messages that were quite striking. Here they are. • Cockell said that England was being treated unfairly and that the Barnett formula should be abolished to ensure Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland no longer receive preferential treatment. In 2011/2012 England received £8,500 per person for public services. By contrast Scotland received £10,000. And last week it was announced that Scotland’s day-to-day revenue spending would fall by 1.9% in real terms in 2015 and capital budgets would rise by £400 milion, to a total of £3.3 billion. (Pause) Contrast that with our settlement… Every year I meet my opposite numbers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and they listen to us in wide-eyed disbelief at the budget cuts we are enduring and they are not. We need to ask; if we are taking dramatically bigger cuts spending review after spending review and the other nations are getting freed from over-centralised control, what are we in England getting out of devolution? Well the answer is, not enough. I know that none of us want to hold the other nations back but we need equity and fairness throughout the United Kingdom. • He said that the current model for funding councils was \"in many ways already bust\" and that it was unsustainable in the medium to long term. We know from our own modelling work the current financial position of many councils is unsustainable in the medium to long term. Prior to the settlement last week, our analysis suggested that for 86 councils – from different regions, tiers and political control – estimated income would account for less than 85 per cent of projected spend in 2015/16. The good news is that following the success of our lobbying on social care, it is now 56 but that is still far too many. Put simply, these councils will be short by at least 15p for every £1 they are currently committed to spend ... The current model we have, indeed for public services overall, set in the context of an over centralised national state, will not see us through for very much longer. In many ways it is already bust. And while we're on the subject of welfare, this is from Peter John, the Labour leader of Southwark council. Sarah Teather, the Lib Dem former education minister, used an interview on World at One to launch a withering attack on some of the government's policies on immigration and welfare. Here are the main points. • Teather said that asking landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants was \"completely unworkable\". Asking private landlords to become Home Office immigration officials is unfair on landlords, it’s completely unworkable, and it’s very likely to result in quite a lot of law abiding families in this country being denied access to housing ... As a local MP I look at people’s immigration status all the time when they come in asking for help. It’s very complicated to work out whether somebody has a right to remain here. The documents are not straightforward. It’s not just as simple as looking at someone’s passport. It was the Home Office's job to tackle illegal immigrants, not a job for landlords, she said. \"We’re at a risk of making the situation infinitely worse and frankly, also fracturing communities,\" she said. • She accused the government of deliberate scaremongering and using immigration to distract attention from more serious problems. The government was \"whipping up fear\", she said. I think the real truth about [the landlord proposal] unfortunately is that it’s another example of distraction politics – it’s about creating and defining an enemy so we can distract away from people’s real worries. The thing about chasing fear, I’m afraid, is that if you go down that route you’re not going to find hope at the end of that road, you’re going to find a whole lot more fear and it’s going to become a self-fulfilling prophesy. • She said she was \"extremely concerned\" about George Osborne's plan to make people wait seven days until they can claim jobseeker's allowance. I’m extremely concerned about this particular proposal – it seems to me to be a fast track to debt. If you’re coming in and out of low paid employment and living hand to mouth, those extra three or four days are going to be a real problem for you and your family. Again, it feels as if it’s about politics that’s about looking tough but not actually solving the real problems. I suspect that people will find it easier to look for work if they and their children are not hungry. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. In his LBC phone-in Boris Johnson said that no one had complained to him about the supposed incompetence of Stephen Greenhalgh, his deputy mayor for policing. (See 9.05am.) I haven't got the exact quote, and I'm not sure whether he meant no one had raised Greenhalgh's general performance, or just his performance at a recent committee hearing. Jenny Jones, the Green member of London assembly, has been in touch to say she raised Greenhalgh's performance with Johnson in December last year. You can watch the exchange here. She told the mayor that Greenhalgh had made \"a long line of slip-ups\". Cameron has finished his statement. Theresa May, the home secretary, is now making her statement on stop and search. My colleague Alan Travis has already previewed what she will be saying. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, says there are 11,000 foreign prisoners in UK jails. There is a European prisoner transfer agreement, he says. But only Britain and 12 other countries have ratified it. Can Cameron get this on the European Council's agenda? (This is a rare example of a Eurosceptic calling for more European co-operation.) Cameron says he wants the EU to make more progress on this issue. Cameron says Britain has always believed in a \"wider, looser\" Europe. If that is going to be achieved, the EU will have to become more flexible, he says. David Nuttall, a Conservative, asks Cameron if he agrees that the accession of Croatia to the EU will put an extra burden on EU funds. Cameron says it will lead to a \"modest\" increase in the burden on the EU. But Britain is in favour of EU expansion. There will be a larger market for British goods, he says. Labour's Paul Flynn asks what lasting achievements justify the £37bn spent on Afghanistan and the 444 British deaths. Cameron says Afghanistan used to be a safe haven for terrorists. Since 2001 that has not been the case, he says. In 2006 there were no Afghan security forces in Helmand. They did not exist. But that is not to say things are perfect, he says. Jason McCartney, a Conservative, asks Cameron if he supports Freedom Parades. Cameron says he does. There is a yearning from people who want to find a way of celebrating the military. This is not a party political point, he says. Gordon Brown felt the same. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn says it is time to reassess intervention. It leads to hatred between countries, he says. Cameron says he disagrees. Non-intervention in Afghanistan led to it becoming a safe haven for terrorists. Labour's Yasmin Qureshi asks about drones. Cameron says this is an issue for the US and Pakistan. But it is a \"fact\" that huge damage has been done to al-Qaida. In Afghanistan, he is in favour of giving the armed forces as much protection as possible. Drones have helped to do that, he says. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says his son, who is serving in Afghanistan, called him last night. His son said he wanted MPs to know how much service personnel appreciated Cameron's visit. Cameron says he met people who were on their third tour of the country. Their morale is high. And they are positive about the kit they have, he says. Here's the full text of Cameron's statement. Cameron says that on an EU referendum, people should either be in favour or against. But Labour is adopting neither position. Its stance is \"feeble\". Angus Robertson, the SNP MP, asks Cameron if he will end the \"scare stories\" about an independent Scotland not being part of the EU. Cameron says an independent Scotland would have to queue up for EU admission behind Serbia, Macedonia and Kosovo. That is the inconvenient truth for the SNP, he says. John Baron, a Conservative, asks if Cameron will ensure that talks with the Taliban are unconditional. Cameron says he has favoured a peace process since he became prime minister. Historians can argue about whether the Berlin peace talks were wrong to exclude the Taliban, he says. But Afghanistan must not be used as a base for external attacks. James Gray, a Conservative, asks what will happen to Camp Bastion after the British withdraw. Cameron says no final decision has been taken, but it is \"likely\" that it could be used as a base for those Americans who are staying in Afghanistan. Bill Cash, a Conservative, asks what the negotiating mandate is for the US/EU free trade talks. It has not been disclosed, he says. Cameron says it is a wide mandate, although audio-visual content is excluded. Labour's Sir Gerald Kaufman asks if Cameron discussed American drone attacks with his Pakistan opposite number. They are a \"war crime\", he says. Cameron says he favours a \"very tough security approach to terrorism\". The presence of al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan has been radically reduced, he says. That has made people safer in Britain. Labour's Gisela Stuart points out to Cameron that the referendum bill is only a backbench bill. Cameron says there is growing support for reform in Europe. He did not explain the intricacies of parliamentary procedure to his EU colleagues, he says. John Bercow, the Speaker, says it is probably a good thing that Cameron did not try to explain parliamentary procedure to them given that he tried to put his own name to the referendum bill (which was disallowed, because it would have become a government bill if he had done that). Cameron says the Afghan army dealt with the recent attacks in Kabul on its own. Sir Peter Tapsell, a Conservative, asks what the government is doing to ensure that Afghanistan does not split after the British leave. Cameron says he understands that concern. That is why Britain will continue to help the country. He sees no reason why it cannot stay together. Cameron is responding to Miliband. Talking about his language, he says there are 27 other countries that want to get rid of the EU budget rebate, as well as the EU president and the commission. Labour's approach is to go in with a white flag. That's why it gave up so much of the rebate. He says the work programme has helped 320,000 people into work. And he says it was interesting that Miliband did not mention the EU referendum. That is because the party is confused. Cameron says he can sum up Miliband's position in three words - \"weak, weak, weak\". Ed Miliband is responding to Cameron. Can Cameron give more details about the role of British troops after 2014? Can he say what the prospects are for getting the political talks on track? And on what timetable? On the EU, Miliband says he welcomes Croatia joining the EU. He says it would be a shame not to quote Cameron's words at the end of the summit. (See 8.53am.) This sounded \"more Carry On Up the Council than High Noon\", he says. He says the youth contract is not the solution to the youth unemployment problem. And, while of course the government should look at regulation, that is not the solution to youth unemployment. Cameron cannot argue for action in Europe on this when his policies are failing at home, he says. Turning to the EU summit, he says EU leaders finalised the EU budget. But there was another attempt to unpick the British rebate, he said. This was unacceptable and frustrating. The proposal would have cost Britain £1.5bn. But it was rejected, he says. The EU also discussed tackling youth unemployment. They agreed that the European Investment Bank would increase its lending by 40%, he says. They also agreed to scrap unnecessary regulation. In the UK a new business taskforce will be set up to take a fresh look at the impact of regulation. Referring to Kazakhstan, he says it has the potential to be the sixth biggest oil and gas producer in the world. His business delegation signed deals worth £700m. He concludes saying his party favours an EU referendum. His MPs will be voting for this on Friday, he says. Cameron says the political process is making progress. President Karzai told him that next year Afghanistan would see the first peaceful handover of power in its history. Cameron says he welcomes plans for direct talks with the Taliban. The peace process must be Afghan-led, he says. He says he was also encouraged by his visit to Pakistan. He met the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and his election was the first democratic handover from one prime minister to another in that country. David Cameron says his statement will cover Afghanistan and the EU summit. He visited Afghanistan on Armed Forces Day, he says. Britain is in Afghanistan for one reason - to protect people in this country. On security, four years ago three quarters of the most serious plots against the UK had links to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Today it is less than half, he says. British forces are confident that the Afghan army is capable, he says. This is allowing troops to be withdrawn. There are now 7,900 troops in the country. By the end of the year it will be 5,200. Britain is funding an Afghan army academy, he says. • Boris Johnson has admitted he has been thinking about running for a third term as London mayor, despite previously insisting he would not serve more than eight years. • Johnson has also renewed his call for an amnesty for illegal immigrants. • Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has said that the government's handling of the departure of Stephen Hester as RBS chief executive has damaged the chances of returning the bank to the private sector. Balls was speaking at the Times CEO summit in London. I thought the handling of the Stephen Hester departure was very poor and destabilising. It is no surprise that the taxpayer stake in RBS is worth £4 billion less today than it was worth the day before Stephen Hester announced his retirement ... If the reason why you want a transition is to give five years' stability, which was the explanation on the day, then I would have thought what you do is make sure you are in a position to announce a successor for the next five years, and that didn't happen,\" he said. The appearance that this happened because of a political intervention is quite damaging and will make it harder and take longer now to get to where we want to be, which is RBS off the government books and back into the private sector. Balls also said too much was being expected of Mark Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England. To quote Monty Python, he is not the Messiah. He can't work miracles. The reality is, interest rates are already very low. The government rely upon the Bank of England to drive this recovery. I don't think it is possible with the Bank of England's powers. I think too much expectation has been heaped on to the new governor, which I don't think it is possible for monetary policy to deliver. • The Treasury has published a report saying that Scottish independence would \"lead to short-term and long-term costs, and prolonged uncertainties, for businesses and consumers\". (See 11.21am.) The SNP has dismissed the claim. Kenneth Gibson, an SNP MSP, put out a statement saying a new survey shows that 52% of small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland favour independence. This is a welcome report which shows that among the SMEs surveyed in Scotland, a clear majority favour independence. On the day that the UK Government presents its latest 'Project Fear' report, this survey indicates that the negative approach of the No campaign is backfiring. Business men and women on the ground know that deciding economic policies in Scotland means better policies for Scottish business - for example the small business bonus scheme, creating the most competitive business rates environment anywhere in the UK. And with the full powers of independence, Scotland can achieve even more. • The Welsh assembly has been preparing to vote on a measure to introduce an opt-out organ donation system for Wales. • Vicky Pryce, Chris Huhne's former wife, has been giving evidence to a Lords committee on the Eurozone crisis. She is still obliged to wear a tag following her release from jail, but it was not visible beneath her outfit. \"I'm feeling just fine, thank you very much,\" she said when asked how it felt to be back in parliament. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories published yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here's the ConservativeHome roundup of today's political stories, and here's the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. As for the rest of the papers, here are some articles I found particularly interesting. • James Cusick in the Independent says Michael Gove is considering allowing academies and free schools to become profit-making. Academies and free schools should become profit-making businesses using hedge funds and venture capitalists to raise money, according to private plans being drawn up by the Education Secretary, Michael Gove. Details of discussions on the proposed redesign of academy regulations were leaked to The Independent by Department for Education insiders who are concerned that Mr Gove is going too fast and too far in his ambition to convert all 30,000 schools in England to academies. On Twitter, Tory Education (widely assumed to be a mouthpiece for Michael Gove's aides) has been rubbishing the story. • Boris Johnson in a letter in the Times (paywall) says he would support fracking in London. It is time for maximum boldness in energy supply. I fully support the Government’s drive for nuclear power, and if reserves of shale can be exploited in London we should leave no stone unturned, or unfracked, in the cause of keeping the lights on. • Rowena Mason and Christopher Hope in the Daily Telegraph say a Commons committee has been looking into whether it could block a move by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to increase MPs’ salaries by around £10,000. • Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) asks who is running the Labour party. Unite is running a deliberate and carefully targeted campaign to get its preferred candidates selected all over the country. I’ve been sent the minutes of the union’s executive council meeting, dated December 3, 2012, which describe the drive in Falkirk as “exemplary”. The document boasts of six other candidate selections on which Unite has had a “direct impact” — in Peterborough, Norwich South, Harlow, Hastings, Tamworth, and Crewe and Nantwich. “This is not an exhaustive list of the better candidates,” the minutes note; but without the union’s work “Progress [the Blairite think-tank] or other right-wing candidates would have been selected.” Although Unite argues that it wants to increase the number of working-class people in Parliament (a worthy aim) it is clear that they have to be manual workers with left-wing views. The truth is that this is about ideology not social mobility. There has been controversy already over claims that seats in the European Parliament are being stitched up for union-backed candidates. The “Unite Political Strategy”, produced last January, talks of a drive “to extend our influence in the party” and promote “socialism for the 21st century” by securing the adoption of “trade union (or union-friendly) candidates in winnable constituencies”. It sets a target of recruiting 5,000 Unite members to Labour with a view to influencing selections. “This is emphatically not just a recruitment offensive to benefit the Labour Party with passive financial contributions,” the document states. “We are deadly serious about transforming Labour.” Revealingly, Mr McCluskey has begun writing to Labour politicians whom his union supports, addressing them as “Unite MPs”. • Benedict Brogan in the Daily Telegraph says that a Tory majority in 2015 is a distant prospect and that David Cameron’s great dilemma will be whether or not to continue the coalition. Privately, the PM accepts that he must force Ukip down to five per cent if he is to stand a chance. But the party is likely to win in the European elections in 2014 and it is by no means certain that it will then collapse like a mis-timed soufflé. The Tories won 36 per cent of the vote last time against one of the most unpopular premiers in modern history. Can they credibly hope to improve on that? Or even be sure of being the largest party? Of course, optimism and the prospect of success can be a unifying force. Mr Cameron may be tempted then to encourage his troops to believe that the tide of politics is turning their way. But the facts of the moment tell us that outright victory remains a distant prospect. A more likely outcome is a repetition of the 2010 result. That’s why, behind the façade of exuberance, we are hearing discreet preparations for a showdown between Mr Cameron and his MPs over whether to continue in coalition with the Lib Dems. This is the great battle ahead. The Treasury has published its latest paper on the potential impact of Scotland voting for independence. This one, Scotland analysis: Business and microeconomic framework (pdf), examines the effect independence would have on business regulation. Like all the other papers in the series, its arguments seem robust, although one does not get the impression that the authors are trying hard to be even-handed. Here are the key claims: • Independence would cut trade from Scotland to the rest of the UK because, although the EU single market allows free trade, it would not be as free as trade within the UK. In the event of independence trade will, of course, continue, but the introduction of an international border would almost certainly have a negative impact. Just a 1 per cent reduction in exports by Scotland to the rest of the UK equates to £450 million of sales. The economic integration of the UK is not replicated in the EU Single Market. Evidence clearly demonstrates many barriers to trade remain between EU Member States, particularly in the services sector that accounts for around three-quarters of Scotland’s output and an even higher share of employment (82 per cent). Small companies with little cross-border experience are likely to be hampered most by the creation of barriers to trade and added bureaucracy. For example, through the need to complete an EC sales list, having to use the EU VAT refund scheme for expenditure on the other side of the international border, or taking the time to understand and comply with the regulatory requirements of each state. The scale of the possible border effect will be considered in a future paper in the Scotland analysis series. • An independent Scotland would have to set up its own version of institutions like Companies House. • Over time Scotland and the rest of the UK would adopt different regulatory and tax systems, \"increasing the barriers to trade on both sides of the border and increasing the cost of compliance for firms who have to comply with two different systems\". • Differences in tax and regulation could make it \"more complex\" for workers to move between the two countries. • Scotland would lose the benefits of infrastructure investment by the UK government, like rural broadband. • Scots could end up paying more for post. That's because the Royal Mail's universal postal service disproportionately benefits the large parts of Scotland that are rural, where the current cost of posting a letter is the same as in a city even though the cost to the Royal Mail of providing the service is much higher. And here's how the document sums up its case. Currently, Scotland’s integration within the UK’s domestic market brings benefits to all. The size and scale of that market brings opportunities to trade, move jobs, collaborate to develop new and future technologies, travel and communicate with each other efficiently and benefit from economies of scale. The analysis in this paper shows that effective common regulations and institutions, a unified labour market, a shared knowledge base and integrated infrastructures are central to the success of this unified domestic market. In the event of a vote for independence bodies that support the UK in its present form would continue to undertake their functions on behalf of the remainder of the UK. However much an independent Scottish state sought to stay aligned with regulations and institutions in the continuing UK, a single market between two separate states is not the same as a fully integrated domestic market. Divergence and fragmentation would be likely to lead to short-term and long- term costs, and prolonged uncertainties, for businesses and consumers. For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 38% (no change from YouGov in the Sunday Times) Conservatives: 33% (no change) Ukip: 12% (up 1) Lib Dems: 8% (down 3) Labour lead: 5 points (no change) Government approval: -31 (no change) This is the second YouGov poll showing Labour's lead at just five points, its lowest level since November 2012. In an article in the Sunday Times, YouGov's Peter Kellner said a poll lead of this size was pointing to a hung parliament rather than to a majority Labour government. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson's Ask Boris LBC phone-in. Uncharacteristically (and disappointingly) he managed to get through the encounter without the usual veiled digs at David Cameron. Cameron may even be cheered by the news that Johnson's post-2016 ambitions are not entirely limited to Number 10. • Johnson said he has considered breaking his promise not to stand for re-election as London's mayor in 2016. But he joked that there would have to be a \"reverse Morsi\" (ie, popular protests in favour of him staying) to get him to stand again. The truth is that there are so many things we are trying to do at the moment that I know I am not going to be able to get in in time for 2016 that it is becoming increasingly ... I won't deny it, [standing again] is something I think about and something that I've even talked to friends about. But the reality is that after eight years you've been at it for a long time in a very big job. You see what happens to people who do things for too long. You've got to be fair to the electorate, you've got to be sure you are doing your best. There will come people who will have fantastic ideas and who will have fresh ways of thinking about things. Johnson concluded by saying it was still his intention not to stand again. The truth is, I'm stepping down in 2016. After that, who knows what will happen. One of Ken Livingstone's problems was that he tried to stay in office too long, Johnson said. • He said the London Underground would become fully automated by the 2020s and that he would not be buying any more tube trains operated by drivers. The first driverless trains are now being ordered, he said. (See 9.31am.) • He said housing was becoming Britain's number one political problem. • He renewed his call for an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK a long time. He would set the cut-off point at 12 years, he said. • He denied reports that he had made a joke about gay people being able to \"take your partner up the Arcelor\" at a speech about the Olympic Park being licensed for weddings. (See 9.14am.) Q: Why are you removing seats from bus stops? Johnson says he does not know about that. But there is a problem with bus stop thefts. Last year something like 22 bus stops were stolen. The whole thing, he says. He was \"absolutely amazed\". People want the metal. Q: How much did you spend when you last had a burger at your desk? Johnson says he last had a burger at Johannesburg airport. Q: The Save Lewisham A&amp;E campaign goes to the high court today. Do you agree the process was not properly carried out? Johnson says that is a matter for the court to resolve. Q: Do you support the closure of Lewisham A&amp;E? Johnson says that is not a matter for him. He does not run the service. But he will support hospital reforms that will actively save lives. Q: Four A&amp;E units are being downgraded. How will you protect London from this? Johnson says stroke treatment has improved. London is one of the best places in the world to have a stroke, he says, if that does not sound frivolous. Q: But you might have to go a long way to get that care. Johnson says people like having services locally. But if you do that, you do not get the quality. Since stroke services were centralised, outcomes have improved. But that is not happening in other areas, like oncology and paediatric care. He says it is a \"scandal\" that if you are taken ill at the weekend, you are more likely to die. Q: What is happening to the old buses replaced by the new Routemaster? Johnson says they will be redeployed in London. Q: You have wasted more than £10m buying new buses for route 24. How can you justify that? Johnson says he has a \"fantastic new bus\" for route 24. When he talks to the conductors … Q: They are not conductors. They don't check tickets. They are just platform attendants. Johnson says Londoners have lost the knack of using a hop-on, hop-off bus. People try to enter the bus from the front. Q: Is it because route 24 serves Conservative voters in Pimlico? No, says Johnson. Call Clegg lasts just half an hour. But Ask Boris is running for 45 minutes. We've got 15 minutes to go. Q: Have you got any plans for driverless trains on the underground? Johnson says he is buying driverless trains for the Piccadilly line. Never again will he buy a train with a cab for a driver. The DLR does not have drivers. This will be a huge advance, he says. There will not be old-fashioned drivers in the way we have now. Q: When will it be fully automated? In the 2020s, Johnson says. This is necessary because of the increasing demand. Q: Why did you double the salary of Peter Hendy, the Transport for London commissioner? Johnson says he did not double Hendy's salary. But Hendy did a fantastic job during the Olympics. He deserved a reward. Q: Under your Housing Moves scheme, people cannot move to a property in their own borough. But some boroughs, like Lambeth, are very big. Johnson says that is a good point. He will look at that idea. Q: How many new homes are you building? And how many are affordable? Johnson says the cost of housing is becoming the number one political problem the country faces. Britain will not solve it by rent controls. It does not work, because it stops people putting homes on the market for rent. He says he is putting more land up for development. And the new homes being built on those sites will be affordable. At the Olympic Park, 50% of the homes being built there are affordable. Q: How do you define affordable? It is below market price, says Johnson. The exact figure depends on the local market. Q: When will you make cyclists pay road tax, have insurance and obey the traffic rules? Johnson says he is not going to do the first two. But it is very important that cyclists obey the rules, he says. Q: What about licensing? Johnson says he is against that. It would lead to excessive bureaucracy. Q: Why did you bring a wooden racket to a tennis event recently? Johnson says he plays with a wooden racket. Q: Would you make a good prime minister? Johnson says he is going to \"swerve\" this one. He was lucky to be elected mayor. People were suprised he was elected, not least him. He is totally absorbed in his job. Q: Is it totally certain you will not run again for mayor? What if there were demonstrations on the streets? A reverse Morsi situation, Johnson says. He says there are some projects that will take a while to complete. This is something that he has talked about with friends. But there will be people with \"fantastic ideas\" and new ways of looking at things. Ken Livingstone did some good things, he says. But he tried to stay too long. Johnson says he is stepping down in 2016. After that, he does not know what he would do. Q: So you are stepping down? What if there are demonstrations in the streets? Johnson says Nick Ferrari would have to fill Trafalgar Square. Q: Why does David Cameron jinx people when he offers them his support? [Cameron supposedly did this with Laura Robson.] Johnson says this is totally unfair. It is an optical illusion. Cameron was just offering his support. Q: Are there more or fewer police officers on the streets of London? Johnson says there are probably more officers actually on the streets of London. Q: And is the deficit going up or down? It is going down, says Johnson. In their hearts, people know that the deficit is too large. Q: What was the number of police officers when you took office? About 32,000, says Johnson. Q: But there are just 30,666 now. The question was about the numbers on the street, says Johnson. Q: Your \"take your partners up the Arcelorl\" joke was a bit crude, wasn't it. Shouldn't we be more grown up? Nick Ferrari reads out the quote. Supposedly Johnson said it at an event a few weeks ago, talking about gay marriage. Johnson says he did not use those words. [There is a report about it here.] His speech was about gay marriage. He made what he thought was an amusing reference to marriage in the Olympic Park. Q: So what did you say? You had to be there, says Johnson. He says people should not believe the reports. Q: You've got a letter in the Times saying you are in favour of fracking. Yes, says Johnson. Wind power would not \"pull the skin off a rice pudding\". The Shard uses as much energy as the town of Colchester. We need energy. Q: And you are comfortable with the environmental impact of fracking? Let's look at it, says Johnson. Shale gas offers quite a clean source of power, he says. If those reserves exist in the south-east, let's be \"grown up\", he says. Q: What is happening to the people evicted from Hendon football club? Johnson says this is a \"chronic problem\". Over the last 20 years, the authorities have failed to evict any illegal immigrants. The number deported has been \"vanishingly small\". That is because of the human rights culture and \"ambulance-chasing lawyers\". It is very hard to get people on planes. People just \"melt away\". But \"fair play to Theresa May\", he goes on. She has tried to get a grip on this. Q: Where do you stand on an amnesty? Johnson says when he first raised this other political leaders turned their \"machine guns\" on him. Yet we effectively have an amnesty, because the authorities do not pursue people who have been here a long time. He is still in favour of granting people an amnesty if they have been in the UK for 12 years, he says. But the key thing is to kick people out before they reach that point, he says. Peter from Twickenham goes first. Q: Your deputy mayor for policing, Stephen Greenhalgh, seemed incompetent when I watched him last week. Why does he deserve a six-figure salary? Johnson says he is doing an excellent job. Crime is falling. Peter says Greenhalgh was \"floundering\" at a committee meeting last week. Nick Ferrari says people were laughing at Greenhalgh at the meeting. Johnson says people laugh at him (Johnson) too. This is the first time people have raised this with him. He will go off and make inquiries about how Greenhalgh did at the committee. Boris Johnson starts by saying he wants to say a few things about what is happening at City Hall. He had a \"very good settlement\" in the spending review, he says. That will allow six years' investment in London transport. Crossrail 2 is now \"on the map\", he says. There will be an event at the Olympic Park on 19 July. It will appeal to people who volunteered in the Olympics last year. Tickets are now on sale, he says. Did you catch what David Cameron said at the end of last week’s EU summit in Brussels? He complained that other EU leaders were trying to bounce him into agreeing a cut in Britain’s rebate and, in colourful language, he let rip. In this town you have to be ready for an ambush at any time, and that means lock and load and have one up the spout, and be ready for it. Perhaps he’s been watching too many war films again. Anyway, he will get a chance to elaborate when he delivers a statement on the EU summit in the Commons later. And before that we’ve got Boris Johnson’s first regular, Call Clegg-style LBC phone-in. I’ll be covering that in detail too. Here’s the agenda for the day. 9am: Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, begins his new monthly phone-in on LBC, Ask Boris. 10am: Paul Tucker, the Bank of England deputy governor, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 10.30am: Vicky Pryce, Chris Huhne’s ex-wife and a former head of the government economic service, gives evidence to a Lords committee on the eurozone crisis. 12.30pm: David Cameron makes a statement in the Commons on last week’s EU summit and his trip to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kazakhstan. Around 1.30pm: Theresa May, the home secretary, is making a statement in the Commons about stop and search. As Alan Travis reports, she is expected to say that the widespread use of these powers has been seen as sharply divisive among Britain’s black and minority ethnic communities. 2pm: Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee on Scottish independence. 2.30pm: Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, and Sir David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, give evidence to the Commons health committee on the Health and Social Care Act. 3.15pm: Ed Davey, the energy secretary, gives evidence to the Commons energy committee. At some point today Sir Merrick Cockell, the chair of the Local Government Association, is also giving a speech calling for a “major revolution” in the way money is allocated to councils. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary before 12.30pm and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/11/uk-netherlands-power-cable-britned","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-11T12:32:25Z","webTitle":"BritNed power cable boosts hopes for European supergrid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/11/uk-netherlands-power-cable-britned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/11/uk-netherlands-power-cable-britned","fields":{"headline":"BritNed power cable boosts hopes for European supergrid","bodyText":"It stretches 260km under the North Sea, contains 23,000 tonnes of copper and lead, and may represent the first step towards a renewable energy revolution based on a European electricity \"supergrid\". The £500m BritNed cable, which has just entered operation, is the first direct current electricity link from the UK to another country in 25 years. The high voltage cable, a joint venture between the UK National Grid and the Dutch grid operator TenneT, has a capacity of 1,000MW, the equivalent of a nuclear power station. It runs from the Isle of Grain in Kent to Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. High voltage DC (HVDC) cables allow electricity to be transmitted over much greater distances than existing alternating current lines, which start losing power after 80km. A network of HVDC cables across Europe is seen as the key to \"weather-proofing\" the large scale use of renewable energy, some forms of which are intermittent and have to be balanced in real time with generation elsewhere. \"Our investment in this interconnector means that we are joining a much wider European electricity market,\" said Nick Winser, executive director of National Grid. \"This ability we now have to move power across national borders means we can use the full potential of renewable energy from wind – making it easier to import when wind is not available and export when there is a surplus.\" In the short term, linking the UK and European grids boosts the UK's energy security and helps stabilise wholesale energy prices. Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"Renewables win as it means surplus wind power can be easily shared [and] consumers win as a single European market puts pressure on prices.\" \"This is a major step,\" said Louise Hutchins, head of UK energy campaigns at Greenpeace. \"It sends a signal to renewable manufacturers that we're a step closer to unlocking the potential of one the world's main renewable power houses – the North Sea.\" BritNed auctions the cable's transmission capacity on the open market and all 1,000MW was bought from the first hour of operation on 31 March. Since the start, electricity has flowed from the Netherlands to the UK most of the time. The project took about five years to complete and will be officially opened on 12 May. The idea of a European supergrid gained momentum in December with the signing of an agreement by all 10 nations bordering the North Sea to, for example, co-ordinate the deployment of new HVDC cables. The North Sea offshore grid initiative, backed by the UK prime minister, David Cameron, aims to link renewable energy generation across the North Sea, including wind power from the UK, solar power in Germany and hydropower in Scandinavia, maximising the use of renewable energy. Wilfried Breuer, head of power transmission solutions at Siemens, which manufactured and built the AC-DC conversion stations at each end of the BritNed powerline, said: \"The supergrid will be built, but gradually. It's not one investment like a highway. It will develop over 10-15 years, leg by leg.\" In the UK, the biggest driving force for new HVDC lines will be the 30GW of offshore windpower capacity planned for deployment before 2020. By comparison, the current total UK capacity from coal, gas, nuclear and other sources is 85GW. \"HVDC lines are a commercially driven market. Excess wind power is an asset and you want to be able to sell that,\" said Breuer. Another 10GW of HVDC lines are planned by 2020 including links from the UK to Norway, Belgium and France. The latter is the only nation with an existing HVDC link to the UK, a 2,000MW cable that has been in operation for 25 years. The HVDC line most likely to open next runs from north Wales to Dublin, Ireland, which is due to complete in 2012. The most ambitious HVDC cable under consideration would give the UK access to the vast geothermal energy of Iceland, which is not intermittent. Last month energy minister Charles Hendry said discussions on the legal and regulatory issues posed by such a cable had taken place with the Icelandic government and would continue. However, the distance between Reykjavik and Glasgow is more than 1,300km: the longest existing subsea HVDC cable is 580km, linking Norway and the Netherlands. Within the UK, National Grid is developing plans for two cables, dubbed \"the bootstraps\", which will connect Scotland and England on both the east and west coasts. The west coast cable is further ahead in planning and will run under the sea from Ayrshire to Connah's Quay, near Chester. Scotland has the best wind power resource in Europe, according to trade body RenewableUK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/jan/16/uae-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-16T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"UAE in line to become first Arab country with nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/16/uae-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/jan/16/uae-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"UAE in line to become first Arab country with nuclear power","bodyText":"The United Arab Emirates took a step yesterday towards becoming the first Arab country to acquire a nuclear capability, a move that could prompt other states to seek to join the club and alter the balance of power in the region. The Gulf state said it was seeking a nuclear programme for energy, not to produce an atomic weapon. But other Arab countries, if they built reactors, may be more likely to switch from civilian to military use. The UAE's embassy in Washington said yesterday that Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, was scheduled to sign a nuclear co-operation pact with her UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayid al-Nahyan, at the state department. The pact had been delayed because of protests by members of Congress that it could accelerate nuclear proliferation and add volatility in the region. It will be one of the last acts of the Bush administration, in defiance of concerns raised by Congress. Arab countries having reactors within the next decade would mean stockpiles of nuclear material accumulating in the region. One estimate is there would be enough to build between 1,000 and 2,000 nuclear bombs. Israel is the only country in the Middle East with a nuclear weapons capability, though it publicly refuses to confirm this. Iran is suspected by the US, Britain and other countries of also seeking a nuclear weapons capability, but it claims it is only interested in developing nuclear power to meet its energy needs. The UAE deal will go to Barack Obama to sign off, but his team has not yet expressed a view on it. Republican members of Congress raised worries that nuclear technology could be smuggled from the UAE to Iran. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the senior Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, introduced legislation designed to delay the pact. But Sean McCormack, the state department spokesman, argued that the pact would help counter proliferation. The agreement only came after the UAE agreed to conditions, including signing a protocol that would allow intrusive inspections by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It has also agreed to import nuclear fuel and not build a uranium enrichment plant that would make it possible to switch from civilian to military use. The UAE hopes to have the reactor working by 2017. British, French and US companies are expected to compete for the contract. David Albright, an arms control specialist at the Washington-based International Science and International Security, has been among those sceptical of signing a deal, describing the country as \"a nuclear smugglers' hub\". In November he co-authored a report warning that stocks of nuclear material could accumulate in the Middle East over the next decade which could be used to produce more than 1,700 nuclear bombs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/21/charles-secrett-open-letter-activists","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-21T12:51:27Z","webTitle":"An open letter to the green movement | Charles Secrett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/21/charles-secrett-open-letter-activists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/21/charles-secrett-open-letter-activists","fields":{"headline":"An open letter to the green movement","bodyText":"Dear green activists, What more can NGOs do to help humanity out of the mess we are in? Tried and tested campaign tactics, based on protest and outrage at the incompetence of governments and industry, are not working. It's time to break free from a perpetually defensive mode, and go on the offensive. Spark the reasonable revolution. We need something much more powerful than just direct action or lobbying to encourage politicians, companies and communities to change course and tread a development path where the needs of people and nature are jointly met. The necessary wealth, resources, technologies and ideas are out there. What is missing is the political will to implement. As you constantly warn, we have about 10 years or so to turn around the juggernaut of industrialism, and our gobbling up of earth's resources, before ecosystems start collapsing, species extinctions reach crisis point, and the fundamental stability and productivity of the biosphere (soils, oceans and atmosphere) enters a state of runaway change. That will be the point of no return for billions of people. Imagine the chaos. First, appreciate how powerful you could be from pooling your efforts. In the UK, you employ thousands of staff, spend over £100m annually, and have millions of members. You speak for people from all walks of life, and all political persuasions. Globally, you can multiply those numbers by a factor of 10, and probably much more. Second, stop working in parallel, and unite with other causes – development, human rights, poverty, public health, democracy, community well-being – under one banner: \"For people, for the planet\". The fundamental problems in these fields – authoritarian government, the dominance of selfish elites, rampant neo-liberal economics, and disdain for the workings of nature – are connected. So are the solutions, and therefore your agendas. By co-operating, you reach a critical mass to achieve your aims. Third, every successful revolution has a compelling text at its heart – ideals, goals, words, images and examples that inspire the majority. Where is your equivalent of the Rights of Man, Wealth of Nations, Das Kapital, or Little Red Book? You need to agree a joint manifesto for life. Mine the library of sustainable development strategies to spell out a route map that can take humanity from where we are to where most want to be. Collate the best solutions from public, private and community sectors into a compelling narrative. Pepper it with case studies of what works from around the world. Use simple language and pictures, not the professional jargon of sustainability-speak, to convince the silent majority that the alternatives exist. Then, crowd-source the draft. Iceland is drawing up a new constitution like this. NGOs have the reach to try the approach globally. Bridge the traditional divides between north and south, east and west, where national governments and multinationals have failed. Help the public create a new world order, and confirm the principles, objectives and means to deliver political economies that work for people and nature. That can build ownership of the outcome, and commitment to change, across cultures. Where the intelligence of elites has failed to motivate the mainstream, the wisdom of crowds can succeed. Fourth, build a cross-party political consensus in every nation. You have extensive international networks, and are embedded and respected in most countries. Societal change is about power, and who wields it and why. Your regular interaction with government and companies is not the same as real influence. You must systematically generate significant pressure to change the failing business-as-usual provision of energy, food, housing, jobs, welfare and the other things that people require for a good life. Power resides with voters, tax-payers and constituents. No government can rule without citizen consent. Use the manifesto, and specific proposals for policies, regulations, tax-codes and spending priorities that make environmental, economic and social sense, to show how people's lives will improve from their adoption. Natural allies include scientists, gardeners, fishers, farmers, foresters, sports-people, outdoor recreationalists – tens of millions of people who depend on a clean, healthy environment. Organise locally in every constituency to build formidable alliances between your supporters, other community groups, unions and local businesses. The imperative is to hold government and industry to account at elections and between elections, at AGMs and throughout the year. If they don't respond, motivated electorates and shareholders can throw the bums out. Fifth, do the same in markets. Business too needs a license to operate. Consumers, shareholders and investors are the kings and queens of commerce and industry. No company will invest in, make or sell services and products that people won't buy, or shareholders reject. It's another opportunity to organise and mobilise. Business allies are in sectors like insurance and pension funds that depend on stability and continuity in economy and ecology. And, the entrepreneurs and innovative companies who deal in clean, green and smart technologies, vehicles, products and infrastructure that reconcile a steady-state economy with a steady-state biosphere. Activists and executives can speak with one voice to help decision-makers break free of ideological chains for what works. Neither left nor right, but forward, as the German greens used to proclaim. By taking these steps, you can create the opportunity for governments at global summits to find common cause and tackle climate change, deforestation, ocean depletion, destructive trade patterns, human rights abuses et al – and escape the groundhog day experience of always being bitterly disappointed at every meeting. Finally, accept certain campaigns are not winnable, and simply drain resources. Absolutist positions do not hold up for the majority. Because of climate change, this probably includes total opposition to nuclear power and GM products globally. Focus instead on the conditions where these technologies become acceptable: safe, economic, free of patent control by a few companies, and effectively regulated. This is how NGOs can help mobilise a majority to back changes that give the poor and downtrodden, let alone my son and your children, a fighting chance of enjoying as decent lives as you and I do.

The similarities with BP and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster, although not complete, are obvious. Tepco's share price has halved and public confidence in its handling of the situation has dived. The utility has already been severely criticised by Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, for failing to inform him immediately that a serious explosion had taken place following the earthquakes. \"What the hell is going on?\" asked Kan last week when he finally caught up with Tepco officials, in remarks picked up by a stray microphone. \"Retreat is unthinkable,\" he told the firm, fearing that the decision to evacuate 740 staff from the stricken reactor site was the start of a complete abandonment. BP felt the lash of Barack Obama's tongue last summer when he said that its then chief executive, Tony Hayward, would not still be on the payroll if he had worked at the White House, following Hayward's bungling performance over the oil spill. Tepco directors have not yet been subjected to such personal criticism, but press conferences have degenerated into slanging matches as the company fails to come up with information or explanations. Asked about the cause of a fire that had broken out at the fourth reactor, despite announcements that a similar fire had been put out the day before, company officials said: \"We'll check.\" And when they did provide more information, it was couched in terms apparently designed to infuriate. Asked about the chance of meltdown, the company's answered with the memorable \"the possibility of recriticality is not zero\". BP bombarded the media with a stream of visual, diagrammatic and other information as Hayward toured the degraded beaches of the southern US to show his concern. Tepco officials, by contrast, have kept a lower profile – certainly around Fukushima – but the Japanese utility shares some of the difficulties experienced by the British-based oil major. BP went into the Gulf spill haunted by previous mishaps at the Texas City refinery and Prudhoe Bay gas pipeline; similarly, Tepco's reputation was already tarnished by past mistakes. It was severely criticised after the 2007 earthquake in the Niigata Chuetsu-Oki area when it was forced to shut down a plant, admitting that it had not been designed to cope with such tremors. That plant has never reopened. Five years earlier, Tepco was found to have falsified nuclear safety data at least 200 times between 1977 and 2002. All 17 of the company's boiling water reactors were shut down for inspections after the government provided evidence that Tepco had been concealing incidents. This forced the president, Nobuya Minami, and a number of board members to step down. It was 2005 before the firm was allowed to restart all its reactors. Tepco is now run by Masataka Shimizu, who as well as being the new president is also head of the risk management committee. But he is another Tepco lifer and there have been few signs that the world's fourth-largest utility has been transformed. US embassy cables released by the WikiLeaks website revealed deep unease about all the different nuclear power companies operating in Japan, of which Tepco is the largest. Taro Kono, an MP, claimed in talks with US diplomats that these firms were \"hiding the costs and safety problems associated with nuclear energy\". He accused Japan's ministry of economy, trade and industry of \"covering up nuclear accidents\". Inevitably, given that the situation at Fukushima remains highly uncertain, no one has yet got round to working out the cost of the incident. The Deepwater Horizon spill has cost BP more than $30bn (£19bn) so far but the group can earn more than $20bn in a good year and can easily sell off non-core global assets to fund the bill. Tepco made a profit of ¥134bn (£1bn) and is said by the ratings agency Moody's to face \"potentially massive costs\". And that is not counting the damage to reputation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jul/03/care-older-people-genuine-coalition","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-03T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Issues like care for older people cry out for a genuine coalition | Jackie Ashley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/03/care-older-people-genuine-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/03/care-older-people-genuine-coalition","fields":{"headline":"Issues like care for older people cry out for a genuine coalition","bodyText":"Monday's report on care for elderly people is a crucial test not merely of the coalition or Andrew Lansley, but British politics. This is not some sophisticated, Westminstery battle, but a life-and-death, misery-or-decency choice about the very basics of life for hundreds of thousands of older British people. It's about lack of money, fear for the future and human dignity. And it's like other great issues – energy, pensions, the environment – that show our system is failing. These are the issues that are long term, arouse strong passions and can easily be derailed in parliament. They are the big choices political parties duck, and duck again. And we notice. We watch the ducking and the fudge and the scoring of cheap political points. So when Ed Miliband said on Sunday that Labour wanted to work with the Tories and Lib Dems to sort out social care, he was making a big statement. This was the issue on which, remember, the very same Lansley who now needs help, cynically capsized pre-election talks on a deal, labelling the Labour plan a \"death tax\". That was shameful. So for Labour to forget it, and try to help now, shows a certain generosity. It is not that we want regular backroom deals. Most politics benefits from a good open debate, even a row. But you cannot fix the care system, or secure the right energy balance, or a shift in investment towards greener industries, by passing a piece of legislation and returning to a party dogfight the next time an election looms. You have to agree the change and stick with it for decades – as with the welfare state after the war. Tony Blair, in a new edition of his memoirs, argues powerfully that our political system is broken. It turns good ideas into mush. Special interest groups stop change happening; clever outsiders brought in to help find themselves rubbished and blocked. They soon give up. But, says Blair, politicians from the same \"gene pool\" are too similar and limited. The system is incapable of allowing leaders to make good decisions. Issues like tax reform stir up too many powerful lobbies, so \"the only way of doing it is to take it out of a partisan fight between right and left, construct a platform of shared national purpose and make our system competitive in the new global economy.\" Yes, I know. This is the same Blair whose sofa government and heedless attitude to parliamentary opposition degraded his New Labour brand and led to such policy achievements as the Iraq war. His calls to cut through the morass of political life are the old high-handed impatience of the messianic radical. But on all this, as a hugely experienced leader himself, he also deserves to be listened to. He's far from being alone. Take what the leftwing thinktank Compass (hardly a nest of Blairites) says about the \"red/green\" agenda of radical action on climate change, in a new report: \"Politics isn't working. The poor get poorer and the planet burns, and our collective inability to deal with either creates a third crisis – that of democracy itself.\" Yet the main parties are stuck on the business-as-usual agenda of debt-driven growth: \"No wonder people's faith in politics is declining.\" What Blair wants from cross-party agreements is very far from what Compass wants. But no real change in tax to clamp down on inequality, or to boost low-carbon growth, can happen unless the main parties all agree it has to. The same is true of much else. Look at energy. If we need nuclear power stations, or unsightly windfarms, or huge new gas terminals, we are talking about generational changes, not simply a zig for a few years, and then a zag back. But let's go back to care for the elderly. If we are going to move to a system where the better-off must pay for most of their help – but with a £50,000 cap, after which the taxpayer steps in – that is a big promise. It could be both expensive for the taxpayer, as the numbers of over-80s continue to swell, and also mean more people having to sell their homes to pay for their care. Outrage all round. Yet something must be done, and a mix of new promises on cash, new oversight of private care homes, and enforced insurance to be taken out by younger people seems reasonable. We have to get on with it. Labour's plans might have been better. Tant pis. It is more important to have a plan, that people understand will last for years, than to have no plan at all. I am absolutely not saying that we suspend party politics. But if people are disillusioned with the system generally it is partly because it offers no long-term leadership in any fresh direction. And I do think politicians have to start to realise that popularity can come as much from saying: yes, we will help – we don't like this, and we'd do that differently, but let's try and move forward. Blair's certainly right about everyone in politics coming from inside the same little bubble, and thus being too timid in their thinking. Whitehall remains a closed world, instinctively hostile to outsiders. Lord Browne, the former BP boss, has been asked by Cameron to shake up how departments work, bringing in people from the private, charity and NGO worlds. One of the first things he's discovered is Whitehall's hatred of admitting failure. Of course government, like companies and individuals, fails all the time. But it's hidden in waffle and appendices. The public isn't fooled and the result, again, is cynicism. A greater frankness about trying things out, and then admitting they don't work – and asking why — would help unblock the system. Pilot schemes before Lansley's grand project for the NHS (a classic old-style political scheme, hatched privately and imposed arrogantly, with not nearly enough consultation) would have avoided nine-tenths of the mess and thus his humiliating U-turn. In all this, finally, we in the media have to take our share of blame. The seesaw reporting that always goes \"The government yesterday said this, (so) the opposition said that\" is an idle and binary way of thinking. We pick up stories at Westminster and too rarely follow what happens later, and so monitor what works, and why. We do sometimes approach any outsiders appointed to investigate a tough problem as if they are automatically some kind of corrupt spiv who needs punching. Well, now we have a serious-minded outsider, Andrew Dilnot, with some serious ideas about a very serious social problem, which is long term and difficult; and a serious offer from the opposition to help. Very interesting.

That they have so far failed to do so, however, is not, as you suggest in your editorial (30 May), because \"policymakers are out of solutions for slowing this process\". It is not a lack of policy that is hindering a swift response, it's a shocking absence of political will. The climate crisis is the greatest security threat that we face. If we are to avoid going down in history as the species that spent all its time monitoring its own extinction, rather than taking action to prevent it, we need to move to the equivalent of a \"war footing\", where the efforts of individuals, organisation, and government are harnessed together and directed to a common goal. It will involve a major transfer of resources from north to south to help poorer countries develop in cleaner, more efficient ways than we have done, and a Green New Deal, based on a massive investment in energy efficiency and renewable energies, rolling out a comprehensive housing retrofit programme, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and eliminating fuel poverty in the process. At the same time, a shift away from intensive agriculture, serious investment in public transport, a relocalisation of our economies, and greater prioritisation of energy conservation could all be accelerated through measures to internalise environmental costs. It's not that we don't know what to do. It's that the vast majority of politicians have neither the vision nor the commitment to do it. Recently, the decision to stage a short-term rescue of the economy meant that, almost overnight, the billions required to bail out the banks were found. It should never have been necessary, yet it sets a real precedent for what governments can do when the political will is there. Caroline Lucas MP Leader, Green party • Fatih Birol of the International Energy Agency is right to have lost hope that greenhouse gases can be reduced before global average temperature climbs more than two degrees. But one reason they cannot be reduced is that the climate policy of energy efficiency, continually propagated by the IEA and virtually all other policymakers, has been a case of barking up the wrong tree: whatever energy is saved on a Tuesday through technical efficiency is consumed on the Wednesday for further economic activity and a larger number of economic actors. Birol knows this, as he has worked academically on this issue of \"rebound\" or \"leakage\", yet he repeats, one suspects in a rather low voice, that we must redouble our efforts for efficiency and \"clean\" technology. In fact, only caps on the offending substances will do the trick, yet we have wasted two decades on non-solutions. Can the IEA not finally doubt its policies? Blake Alcott University of Leeds • Part of the reason for record emissions of fossil carbon is that the EU emissions trading system is not working. But some simple reforms would make it much more effective. Instead of issuing allowances to a relatively large number of emissions-producing businesses it would be simpler, cheaper and more effective to control fossil carbon \"upstream\", at the places where coal, oil and gas come out of the ground, or are imported. This would provide control over 100% of emissions in the EU instead of less than 50% with the system as it is now. With caps on fossil carbon determined in the light of climate science, and without free allocations of allowances, a reformed system is likely to raise the price of emissions much closer to its proper level. \"Border levelling\" measures in the proposals would ensure that businesses within the EU would not be put at a commercial disadvantage, and they would provide a solution to the problem of \"import emissions\" arising from fossil carbon that is embodied in traded products. Money raised from the sale of permits may be used to help businesses and people make the transition to the clean, green economy of the future.

Dr Gerry Wolff The Kyoto2 Support Group • Chris Huhne (Letters, 30 May) repeats the coalition mantra: \"too often a community can see what it will lose by having a windfarm in its midst, but cannot see what it gains\". He should tell us what we do gain; we really don't know. He mentions \"strict environmental impact regulations\". No doubt developers do find the regulations onerous; but this is not the same as being effective. He should tell us when and how the Hayes Mackenzie study of best planning practice in relation to wind turbine noise will be published. He writes that wind turbines and associated development require a \"full and proper democratic process\", but he knows that guidance from government to local planning authorities endorses a strong presumption in favour of wind turbines. Maybe Simon Jenkins does \"offer nothing new for Britain's ... energy debate\". He's a journalist Mr Huhne, you're the minister. If you want a serious energy debate, drop the distortions, and engage with the electorate. Janet Dubé Pencader, Carmarthenshire • \"The cheapest low carbon option ... is nuclear power\", George Monbiot says – uncritically repeating the Committee on Climate Change's conclusion to justify more nuclear (Comment, 31 May). And yet the committee's own research (Mott MacDonald. Costs of Low Carbon Generation Technologies. May 2011) concludes that if offshore wind was deployed on a large scale it could be cheaper than nuclear. This puts the responsibility back on to government – it can choose to make renewable energy the cheapest option.

Conservatives on the bench of bishops used the \"taint\" of the spouse's divorce to effectively veto Rev Nick's elevation. The fact that he's a liberal didn't help. But God might well reflect that the Church of England works in mysterious ways. Sometimes that's good. For it does appear that Rev Nick is going to get a mitre after all.

But does Lord T's disdain for \"finding someone to blame\" also reflect his own widely suspected plan to be the outside candidate to succeed Mervyn King at the Bank in 2013? Always the tactician.

Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, ordered a shift in the focus of relief efforts from search and rescue to caring for an estimated half a million people who have been evacuated from provinces affected by the earthquake and tsunami and many others who have been left homeless. The disaster has damaged or destroyed about 60,000 buildings, but the magnitude of the human toll is not yet reflected in figures from the National Police Agency emergency disaster headquarters which show 2,475 dead and 3,118 people missing. The final death toll could rise far beyond 10,000. Save the Children said a fifth of those displaced were children and warned the disaster could result in many being orphaned. As a powerful aftershock rocked Shizuoka, south west of Tokyo, about 1.4m households remained without water and 843,000 households serviced by Tokyo Electric and Tohoku Electric power companies experienced power cuts. Rolling blackouts affected about five million people. \"People are exhausted both physically and mentally,\" said Yasunobu Sasaki, the principal of a school converted into a shelter in Rikuzentakata, a nearly flattened village of 24,500 people in the far-northern Iwate prefecture. \"We survived, but what are we supposed to do from here?\" said Sachiko Sugawara, 63, now living at one of the shelters. Officials in Iwate reported they had lost contact with about 30,000 people, raising concerns of a dramatic increase in the number of deaths. An estimated 10,000 people, half of the population of Minami Sannriku town in Miyagi prefecture, had not been contacted. Across the country, more than 550,000 people are living in temporary shelters. International relief agencies have been kept out of zones affected by radiation leaks from damaged nuclear power stations. Panic increased after another explosion at Fukushima nuclear plant, increasing radiation levels in the area. \"These latest developments will obviously make the humanitarian effort more difficult,\" said Red Cross spokesman Francis Markus. Red Cross worker Patrick Fuller told the BBC that the situation around the coastal town of Otsuchi was desperate, with people scavenging for food and rescue teams trying to put out forest fires. \"I was up at one of the evacuation centres today where there were probably about 300 people just lying on the floor on sheets of cardboard, a lot of them elderly people,\" he said, adding that there were crowds milling around looking for lost relatives. Foreign governments have sent more than 800 emergency relief workers and the Japanese Red Cross has deployed about 90 medical teams to provide basic care for about 430,000 people in remote coastal towns. The threat of nuclear fallout caused panic buying of petrol as people filled their vehicles in anticipation of having to flee a cloud of radioactive gas. Many petrol stations were closed and some rationed sales to 10 litres per car. Save the Children estimated that as many as 100,000 children may have been displaced. The British charity said it was concerned that some of the children affected by the disaster may have also been separated from their families because the earthquake and tsunami struck in mid-afternoon when many children were at school or nursery.Stephen McDonald, who is leading Save the Children's team in Japan, said the most pressing worries for children living in evacuation centres were lack of water and psychological problems associated with trauma and stress. \"Children we talk to say that whenever there's a tremor they are scared that something is going to happen,\" McDonald told the Guardian from Sendai, where the organisation has set up an operations base. About a quarter of the 1,200 people sleeping on cardboard mats at one shelter in Sendai were children, many of them with disabilities. \"Water is a concern here, but there is a large number of volunteers who are providing food and trying to make the place comfortable,\" McDonald said. \"We've been told that people could be here for at least three months. The big question is what we do after that.\" The charity fears that many there children were separated from their parents and relatives by the tsunami or during the chaos that followed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"childrens-books-site/2011/apr/04/satoshi-kitamura-postcard-from-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-04T10:47:47Z","webTitle":"Satoshi Kitamura: Postcard from Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/apr/04/satoshi-kitamura-postcard-from-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2011/apr/04/satoshi-kitamura-postcard-from-japan","fields":{"headline":"Postcard from Japan","bodyText":"When the earthquake struck I was in the studio that I have been renting near my home. I'd just finished the illustration I do for a weekly newspaper column and sent the scan to the editor. Suddenly, the building shook so badly that I feared it would collapse. My studio is at the top of a three-storey concrete structure. It has a glass door which opens on to a small terrace, and I rushed to open it because one thing we all know is that tremors can make doors and windows jam. Apart from that, I couldn't do much more but wait. It must have been a minute or two, but it seemed like a very long time until the tremor stopped completely. One of the shelves fell down and CDs scattered all over the floor. The water in the jar for my watercolour paints spilled on the table. I checked the gas main and set off on the five-minute bike ride to the flat where my wife and I live. It was quiet outside. People looked rather stunned, but calm. There were children walking home from school as if nothing had happened. Being born and brought up in Japan I have experienced hundreds of earthquakes in my life, but this was definitely the biggest. We live in Kawasaki, which is west of Tokyo and a few hundred miles away from the worst-hit areas. So the impact that was felt by people nearer to the epicentre must have been enormous. We had no electricity, water or gas for half a day. I couldn't get in touch with my elderly parents, who live 60 miles away. Later, when the phone lines were restored, I found they were all right. But I cannot visit them at the moment because of the petrol shortage and closures of motorways and public transport. Luckily they are doing well in the care of my brother and his wife. Like many people in Japan I spend my days since the earthquake hopelessly watching the worsening situation on TV. Though survivors from flooded villages weep over the loss of friends and family, they almost always add: \"But there are people who are even worse off ... \" This is the phrase that has come to represent the spirit of young and old alike. It has made me feel a little proud to be a part of this community. The Japanese have spent so many centuries living with the effects of earthquakes and typhoons that we all know how powerless and minute we are in the face of nature. We cannot but feel humble when we encounter natural disasters on this scale. But our humility may be our strength, too. It is this very sense of our personal impotence that makes us understand the life-or-death importance of helping each other. One day, in a local market, my wife and I passed a stall selling fresh seaweed. The middle-aged woman who ran it kept saying that this was the last she would be getting and we should savour it because it was very good. She persuaded us to taste it and it was so delicious that we bought two bags. Later we discovered that she was from a coastal town in Miyagi, one of the worst-flooded areas. She couldn't get in touch with her sister's family, the fishermen who had produced the seaweed, but it didn't occur to her to stop working. She probably didn't want to waste the last consignment her family might ever deliver to her. I admire people who do their work. Some - like the workers at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power station - are putting their own lives in danger to carry on doing their duty. I'm trying to work, too. I'm sitting in my flat in relative comfort, even though we don't know what's going to happen to the damaged power plant and there are still aftershocks every now and again. I have just resumed work on my book. It's a rather crazy story about a teapot character, and it is due to be published in May in Japan and later in the UK. I've been doing rough sketches for it, and trying to work out the sequel to my most recent book, Millie's Marvellous Hat. I don't know if I can continue to write and draw humorous stories, but I'll try. I'd rather aim for something funny and happy than be gloomy. I've never done a story without humour - and besides, one thing that has become very clear in the last few terrible weeks is that ordinary, mundane life is a miracle, and the only place where you can find happiness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/05/fukushima-radioactivity-above-legal-limit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T10:06:10Z","webTitle":"Fukushima radioactivity hit 7.5m times legal limit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/fukushima-radioactivity-above-legal-limit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/05/fukushima-radioactivity-above-legal-limit","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima radioactivity hit 7.5m times legal limit","bodyText":"The radioactivity of saltwater near the Fukushima nuclear power plant reached 7.5m times the legal limit last weekend but has since declined, its operator reported on Tuesday as Japan made a rare appeal for Russian help to cope with the contaminated waste. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) insisted that iodine, caesium and other radionuclides were being diluted to safe levels in the Pacific, but the firm's inability to stem the leak has prompted concern among fishermen, seafood consumers and neighbouring countries. The data was taken from an area closer to the intake pipe of the cracked No 2 reactor than previous lower readings further out to sea. Publication was held back for several days at the insistence of nuclear safety authorities who wanted Tepco to check its numbers after an earlier botched release. The latest figures show levels of radioactive iodine fell from 7.5m times the legal standard on Saturday to 5m times on Monday. Monitoring stations located several hundred metres off the coast also showed contamination has fallen to about 1,000 times the standard, compared with 4,000 last week. Tepco said even the large amounts would have \"no immediate impact\" on the environment, though the chief government spokesman, Yukio Edano, has previously warned a prolonged leak could have a huge effect on marine life. In the latest attempt to stem the radioactive flow, workers will inject \"water glass\" or sodium silicate on the floor of the cracked pit. Previous efforts involving cement, absorbent polymer and rags have been unsuccessful. Despite colouring the water with white bath salts, engineers have yet to trace the path of contamination. In a sign of the company's desperation, Tepco breached its own regulations on Monday by starting an intentional discharge of 11,500 thousands of less contaminated water into the Pacific to make containment space for the more highly radioactive liquid that is seeping out uncontrolled. South Korea's embassy in Tokyo has reportedly expressed concern at the pumping of water that is 100 times the legal limit, but was unclear at the effect it would have on its own waters. \"For now, we have no clear standards to determine how much is how bad for us,\" a foreign minister official was quoted as saying by the Yonhap news agency. Environmental groups warn the radioactivity could enter the ocean food chain. Japan's industry minister, Banri Kaieda, said the discharge would not pose a major health risk, but apologised to fisherman. \"The discharge from unit 2 is incredible. This is clearly water contaminated by direct contact with the core fuel, which means it is likely to contain heavier isotopes, such as plutonium,\" said Shaun Burnie, nuclear adviser to Greenpeace Germany. \"The release of long-lived radionuclides will have a severe impact on both public health and coastal economies. The plutonium will persist in coastal sediments effectively for ever.\" According to Japanese media, fish have been found with traces of iodine and caesium in neighbouring Ibaraki prefecture. The government said it will strengthen monitoring systems and not allow a resumption of fishing until the situation is clear. Tepco said on Tuesday it would pay provisional compensation around the end of April to farmers, local residents and other people affected by the accident. The operation to stabilise the Fukushima plant is likely to take months. Kaieda said the basement of reactor buildings and underground trenches have been flooded with 60,000 tonnes of radioactive water that will have to be pumped into alternative vessels, including waste tanks, an artificial floating island and US navy barges. Japan has requested assistance from Russia to deal with the huge and growing amount of contaminated material. Sergei Novikov, a spokesman for the Russia's state-run Rosatom Corporation, told reporters on Monday that Japan has expressed an interest in a floating radioactive waste treatment facility. The Landysh, as the barge is named, was reportedly built with Japanese assistance. Restoring public trust is also likely to take months. Unease about reliability and transparency were fuelled by reports that the Meteorological Agency has withheld forecasts on the dispersal of radioactive substances. Although the government body provided information on wind patterns and discharges to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Japanese public was kept in the dark. The meteorologists said they did not want to create a panic with simulations and forecasts that had a low level of accuracy.

Along came Raymond Berry. He and a group of friends resolved to stage an East End Gay Pride event in Tower Hamlets – where the stickers appeared – an area that is 36% Muslim. They gained backing from gay and lesbian groups and set up a Facebook account to co-ordinate it all. All is set fair for Saturday 2 April. Or not, as it turns out. For soon it became apparent from the Facebook account that some hovering around the project had sympathies, at least, with those unlovable Muslim-baiting street fighters in the English Defence League. More worrying still was the communication that emerged between Berry and his union, the RMT, to whom he apparently admitted past membership of the EDL and contemporaneous links to other unsavouries such as the Stop the Islamification Of Europe group (slogan: \"Racism is the lowest form of stupidity! Islamophobia is the height of common sense\"). Also the group No Sharia in Britain. And so it was that on Tuesday afternoon – with many people, including us, seeking answers from Mr Berry – the official Facebook site announced that he is standing down from East End Gay Pride. But organisations such as Rainbow Hamlets – the LGBT forum for Tower Hamlets – and Imaan, the LGBT Muslim support group, worry about any further link between the parade and the EDL, despite assurances to the contrary. Both call for a complete change of leadership and for Pride London to work with the local community to rescue the initiative. Wouldn't that make sense? • A musical interlude now, as we bring you a charming charity ditty, \"Securing Your World\". It was commissioned from two Texan songwriters and is selling in vast quantities on several continents. All in a good cause, the £1m it seems destined to raise will be channelled to help children and families. Some will question the motives of security specialists G4S engaging in such benevolence, with its troubled history of forced deportations of migrants, and all the concerns that have been voiced about its stewardship of prisons. But we think they are genuine. It's a lovely song. Gives the expelled migrants something to hum during the long trip home. • And say what you like about our diplomats, but in Paris at least they have impeccable timing. As Japan lurched dangerously close to post-earthquake nuclear catastrophe, Our Man in Paris, Sir Peter Westmacott, was, we are told, valiantly trying to explain to French and British businessmen the potential benefits of nuclear. The embassy hosted a conference for 150 people hoping to persuade the French electricity firm EDF to give British companies more business. Officials worried that too few would turn up but many were there as Sir Peter conceded that this was not the best time to be talking about nuclear power. He assured them that the last time Britain suffered a major earthquake was in the 14th century. It was a tough sell in the circumstances, but the diplomatic corps is trained to cope and he's a pro. Everyone thought he did his best. • For some things are hard to explain. Like why did Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich cheat on his wife? \"There's no question at times of my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate,\" he told the Christian Broadcasting Network. America, you made him do it. You should be ashamed. • Still, everyone deserves a shot at redemption. So there will be joy indeed now it has been confirmed that Damian McBride, Gordon Brown's spin doctor who made the mistake of getting caught seeking to dish personal dirt on the Tories, is being given a chance to redeem himself as the new head of press and PR at the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development. He worked for Gordon through good and bad, in government and at the Treasury. A saint would go bad in that time. Damian was no saint."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/04/open-door-explaining-fukushima-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Open door: Explaining the Fukushima crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/04/open-door-explaining-fukushima-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/04/open-door-explaining-fukushima-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Open door: Explaining the Fukushima crisis","bodyText":"The still-unfolding tragedy of Japan may be told simply through the statistics of death and destruction. However, the scientific complexity underlying the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is much harder to report. There are many kinds of radiation and more than one view as to the short- and long-term effects of exposure. Trying to explain in a clear, accurate fashion what is happening to the plant's damaged reactors and the workers struggling to bring the plant under control is not helped by occasionally contradictory pronouncements from the management of Tepco, which operates Fukushima (at one point Tepco officials said radioactivity levels in one part of the plant were \"10 million times higher than normal\", then retracted this statement within 24 hours). One of the key issues confusing some readers is the way levels of radiation were compared. Early on in the crisis we compared a rate of dose as being \"equivalent\" to an amount of dose, which one reader said was not a like-for-like comparison and therefore meaningless. It was the subject of a long clarification on 31 March. Another problem area for the use of the word \"equivalent\" is in saying such-and-such a dose of radiation in an hour is \"equivalent\" to, for instance, twice the natural background radiation in a year. It is accurate to talk about equivalent amounts of radiation, but journalists are on dangerous ground if we make out they have equivalent health risks. The Guardian's science correspondent puts the point this way: \"You can think of it like exposure to the sun's rays. I could move somewhere and get twice as much sunshine in a year, but if I received all that sun in one hour, I would be toast. Because one hour in very intense sunlight will do me more harm than the same amount of sunlight evened out over the year.\" A useful briefing note for journalists has been produced by the Science Media Centre of Canada. The biological effect of radiation in the human body, called the dose equivalent, is measured in a unit called a sievert (Sv): \"The basic idea of this unit is to approximate the degree of damage to the cells of our bodies, proportional to the number of ionising particles that pass through them. The nuclear incidents in Japan are reporting dosages using sieverts as the unit. Most doses that humans are exposed to are smaller than one sievert – they are in the range of millisieverts (thousandths (0.001) of a sievert, or mSv), or even microsieverts (thousandths of a millisievert, or 0.000001 Sv). \"Often, exposures are described by millisieverts per year, as that's the scale of background exposures … According to the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, the average person receives about 2.4 mSv (0.0024 Sv) of radiation a year through background sources such as cosmic rays, soils, and food. In addition, the average person receives about 1 mSv/year from medical X-rays. This can vary widely depending on where you live.\" One reader wrote to point out that one article published on 29 March states that \"One of the plant's three reactors contains plutonium in its fuel mix\", while in fact, due to the nature of fission reactors, all of the reactors contain some plutonium. Of the three damaged reactors at Fukushima, only reactor three has plutonium in its fresh fuel, but the reader is right in the general sense. According to our science correspondent: Plutonium-239 cannot be made from the fissioning, or splitting, of uranium-235. In the Fukushima reactors, plutonium-239 is a by-product of nuclear fission, and occurs when uranium-238 in the fuel absorbs neutrons. This means that all three reactors then contain plutonium at small levels. All of the spent fuel rods kept in the storage pools at each reactor will also contain some plutonium[see footnote]. Another reader pointed out – correctly – that a reference in a story published on 27 March to iodine-134, which has a half life of 53 minutes, must be wrong: \"A fission product with a half-life of less than an hour couldn't still be around over two weeks after the reactor was shut down. That's 400 half-lives, meaning that every single atom of it should have decayed by now.\" The Fukushima crisis means that for months to come the Guardian will be reporting on the nuclear debate in even more detail than hitherto. The challenge will be one of explanation as much as disclosure. • This article was amended on 4 April 2011. The original said that \"some of the uranium in the fuel rods will fission into plutonium\". This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/15/japan-battles-contain-nuclear-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T21:08:00Z","webTitle":"Japan battles to contain nuclear crisis and relieve quake survivors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/japan-battles-contain-nuclear-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/15/japan-battles-contain-nuclear-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Japan battles to contain nuclear crisis and relieve quake survivors","bodyText":"Fears of a catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan escalated following a third explosion and a fire in another reactor that caused radiation to rise to harmful levels. Fifty to 70 technicians were left to struggle with a possible breach of the containment vessel in reactor No 2, where meltdown is feared, while staff were also battling earlier today to deal with a separate blaze which briefly flared at reactor No 4. All but essential staff were ordered away from the plant. The blast on Tuesday is thought to be the most serious yet because it may have damaged the crucial containment vessel that surrounds the nuclear core and prevents radiation from leaking out. Any damage to it caused by the explosion increases the risk that radiation will be released from the core, though IAEA officials said the damage was minor and there appeared to be no immediate danger of radiation escaping. The explosion was followed by a fire at a storage pond at reactor 4, where spent fuel rods were being cooled. That fire was extinguished, only to break out again early this morning as officials continued to worry that the pool could boil dry and expose fuel rods to the atmosphere. Tokyo Electric Power, which operates the plant, said it was considering dispersing boric acid, a fire retardant, over reactor 4 from a helicopter. Despite calls by the Japanese government for calm, panic spread as several airlines cancelled services to Tokyo, and flights out of Japan quickly sold out. Foreigners were fleeing the country while many local residents left the capital for the western city of Osaka. Those among Tokyo's 12 million people who stayed remained indoors or stripped shop shelves of bread, bottled water, batteries and candles. Partly prompted by the prospect of power cuts, the hoarding threatened to hamper efforts to divert supplies to the area stricken by Friday's earthquake and tsunami, where millions are suffering food and water shortages. The earlier fire at reactor No 2 led to a brief spike in radiation that reached a dose known to be dangerous to health, although levels dropped substantially later in the day. While the disaster has become the biggest nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986 and more serious than at Three Mile Island in 1979, experts stressed that even the worst-case scenario would still be on a fraction of the scale of Chernobyl in the Ukraine. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, urged the public to remain calm in a televised address, but ordered anyone still within the 13-mile exclusion zone to leave immediately, and the 140,000 residents within 19 miles to stay indoors. Officials said that health risks to anyone further than 13 miles from the plant were minimal, but public confidence was diminishing. Survivors within the disaster zone expressed distrust in officials and the power station's operators. The prime minister, already embattled before the disaster, is meanwhile under pressure over his handling of the crisis, particularly over the way the nuclear situation has spiralled despite reassurances from officials.The number confirmed dead or missing rose above 10,000, Japan's largest death toll in a natural disaster since the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923, Kyodo news agency said. Forecasters warned of temperatures dropping to midwinter levels across the disaster zone, with snow predicted. Half a million people have been displaced by the disaster and evacuation from the nuclear zone, with Save the Children saying 100,000 children are affected. Shelters and hospitals are running low on fuel and blankets. In Ishinomaki, Patrick Fuller of the International Federation of Red Cross said: \"The tsunami engulfed half the town and many lie shivering uncontrollably under blankets. They are suffering from hypothermia having been stranded in their homes without water or electricity.\"China said it was organising a mass evacuation of its citizens from the north-east of Japan. Tokyo was shaken by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake night, but it was not immediately clear if it was an aftershock. It was centred in Shizuoka prefecture, hundreds of miles south-west of the capital and inland. It was not immediately clear if it was related to last Friday's tremor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/sep/01/tony-blair-west-use-force-iran-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-01T10:25:14Z","webTitle":"Tony Blair: West should use force if Iran 'continues to develop nuclear weapons'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/01/tony-blair-west-use-force-iran-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/sep/01/tony-blair-west-use-force-iran-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Tony Blair: West should use force if Iran 'continues to develop nuclear weapons'","bodyText":"The west should use force against Iran if it \"continues to develop nuclear weapons\", Tony Blair said today, aligning himself with US hawks who have called for strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. The former prime minister made his comments in a BBC interview to publicise his memoirs, A Journey, which are published today. Blair said it was \"wholly unacceptable\" for Tehran to seek a nuclear weapons capability and insisted there could be \"no alternative\" to military force \"if they continue to develop nuclear weapons\". Speaking to Andrew Marr in a BBC interview to be broadcast tonight, Blair says: \"I am saying that I think it is wholly unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapons capability and I think we have got to be prepared to confront them, if necessary militarily. I think there is no alternative to that if they continue to develop nuclear weapons. They need to get that message loud and clear.\" Iran is enriching uranium at its main, internationally-monitored plant at Natanz and is building a second enrichment facility run by the Revolutionary Guards inside a mountain at Fordo, near Qom, southwest of Tehran. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel to power nuclear reactors as well as to make the fissile core of an atom bomb. Tehran insists its nuclear activities are purely peaceful and argues that as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) it has the right to peaceful nuclear technology. But the UN last month imposed a fourth round of sanctions on Iran because of fears it may be secretly developing nuclear weapons. The US and Israel – an undeclared nuclear power outside the NPT – have both refused to rule out military action against Iran. In his exclusive interview with the Guardian, Blair elaborates on why it is unacceptable for Iran to have nuclear weapons, linking this to the 9/11 attacks on the US. The former prime minister wishes he had seen earlier that 9/11 had \"far deeper roots\" than he thought at the time. \"The reason for that, let me explain it, is that in my view what was shocking about September 11 was that it was 3,000 people killed in one day but it would have been 300,000 if they could have done it,\" Blair said, appearing to equate al-Qaida with Iran. \"That's the point ... I decided at that point that you cannot take a risk on this. This is why I am afraid, in relation to Iran, that I would not take a risk of them getting nuclear weapons capability. I wouldn't take it. \"Now other people may say: 'Come on, the consequences of taking them on are too great, you've got to be so very careful, you'll simply upset everybody, you'll destabilise it.' I understand all of those arguments. But I wouldn't take the risk of Iran with a nuclear weapon.\" In the postscript to his book, Blair writes: \"Iran with a nuclear bomb would mean others in the region acquiring the same capability; it would dramatically alter the balance of power in the region, but also within Islam.\" Blair's approach to Iran aligns him with US hawks such as John Bolton, the former American ambassador to the UN, who believes that Israel should have attacked Iran before it started loading fuel into its first nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr on 21 August, although nuclear experts say Bushehr has no link with Iran's secretive uranium enrichment programme, seen as the main \"weaponisation\" threat, at other installations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/28/simon-hoggart-energy-debate-commons","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-27T23:05:14Z","webTitle":"The fox trick and the Greek defence | Simon Hoggart's sketch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/28/simon-hoggart-energy-debate-commons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/28/simon-hoggart-energy-debate-commons","fields":{"headline":"The fox trick and the Greek defence","bodyText":"The day's main event was the debate on energy, featuring Chris Huhne, the Lib Dem cabinet minister, and Ed Miliband, who is running for leadership of the Labour party. Huhne had to demonstrate that he was a loyal member of the Conservative administration. The Tories are all in favour of nuclear power stations, which need to be built lickety-split, as we have few energy supplies left, and within a few years the government will be handing out exercise bikes hooked up to the mains and we will have to pedal frantically if we want to watch Match of the Day – or boil an egg. The Lib Dems, by contrast, are totally opposed to nuclear power. Without the spirit of goodwill that has created the coalition, this might have been a problem. Instead, they have gone for what I think of as the fox hunting compromise. Fox hunting is now illegal, yet carries on much as before. In that way, everyone is happy, except the foxes. In the same way, the coalition parties are agreed that nuclear power should get an immediate go-ahead. On the other hand, it will have to be financed entirely by private money, with no state aid. This means no nuclear power stations will actually be built. The world will gaze in wonder at this cunning arrangement, and will continue to gaze until the lights go out. Huhne is a former member of the European parliament, and it shows. He loves the kind of phrase that is constructed out of abstract nouns, selected to make it easy to translate into 20-odd languages. \"Preventing habitat degradation\"; \"exploring new international sources of funding\"; \"decarbonising our economy\" and the sonorous \"2001: United Nations Year of Biodiversity\". Presumably some young civil servant had the job of putting the speech together at random from a box of cards marked \"Energy and Conservation Bingo\". Huhne read it out with an air of passionate conviction. Somewhere, you felt, an interpreter was falling asleep. Miliband had the opposite problem. He needed to enthuse and excite. The message to Labour backbenchers had to be that he was the chap who would maintain a ferocious attack on the coalition, the leader who would never apologise for the last 13 years but restore his party's morale. The difficulty is that most MPs agree on climate change. \"The other side are more or less right!\" is never going to be a great battle-cry, so he slid over the topic as fast as he could. His main assault was on the Lib Dems, who have had to support policies they explicitly ran against. \"Being a Lib Dem in opposition meant not having to choose … being a Lib Dem in government means not having to choose either!\" Huhne interrupted to say that the government couldn't spend money because we were in a worse position than Greece. \"Aha!\" cried Miliband, \"the Greek defence! You don't need to keep your promises, because of something that happened in Greece!\" A far away country of which we know quite a lot.

Despite similar-sounding manifestos, Labour's climate and energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and his Conservative and Liberal Democrat shadow spokesmen attacked each other's policies at a special debate organised by the Guardian. On the Labour government's planned expansion of Heathrow airport – which is opposed by the other two parties – Tory spokesman, Greg Clark, was forced to deny his party wants to expand another airport in the south-east. It is an idea supported by at least one shadow cabinet colleague and the Tory London mayor, Boris Johnson. Speaking at the Guardian's special green hustings, Clark said: \"We have no plans to build another runway in the south-east.\" Aviation critics, however, pointed out that this did not rule out increasing the use of a smaller airport such as Luton. While Labour and the Conservatives agreed on new nuclear power stations, Miliband accused the Lib Dems of \"ducking\" difficult issues, and asked their spokesman, Simon Hughes, to explain how his party would meet their pledge to cut electricity emissions without it. Hughes did not answer directly, but said instead that a key reason they could meet their energy targets was because they would do more to make homes and businesses energy efficient. Clark was also challenged to explain how the Conservatives could insist there would be no taxpayer subsidies for nuclear power, despite reports that new nuclear reactors could not be built and operated without pubic support. \"We're very clear, we're not going to subsidise it,\" Clark said in response. Miliband and Hughes attacked the record of Conservative councils in opposing windfarms, but Clark said this was because \"we have more councils, and they are more likely to be in rural areas where wind is built\". Labour and the Conservatives disagreed on how the problem could be solved. It was a debate that went to the heart of a wider clash between the party manifestos, over whether the government needed to intervene more to deliver environmental improvements. Clark said there needed to be more incentives for local people to want wind power, such as the party's policy to let communities share in profits. Miliband challenged him to take on local councils, over wind power and other issues, such as insulation, adding: \"It does require leadership. Of course we are in favour of [profit-sharing], but the question is: are you going to say to local authorities 'you have to be part of our plan', or not?\" The most heated debate, was over claims many Conservatives are sceptical that climate change is caused mostly by humans and that the government needs to urgently tackle it. In the most high-profile case, Miliband claimed Tory culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had responded to a question by saying \"there are climate sceptics in all parties\", implying that the shadow business secretary was one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/13/japan-economy-recession-earthquake-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T20:19:09Z","webTitle":"Japan's economy heads into freefall after earthquake and tsunami","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-economy-recession-earthquake-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-economy-recession-earthquake-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Japan's economy heads into freefall after earthquake and tsunami","bodyText":"The full extent of the economic impact of Friday's earthquake and tsunami is becoming apparent , with hundreds of factories shut across Japan, warnings of rolling blackouts and predictions from economists that the disaster would push the country into recession. The Bank of Japan is preparing to pump billions of yen into the economy when it announces an emergency \"quake budget\" on Monday to prevent the disaster derailing the country's fragile economic recovery. Toyota and Nissan said they were halting production at all of their 20 factories. Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, evacuated workers from two plants in the worst affected regions and has not been able to reach the sites to inspect the damage. The plants make up to 420,000 small cars each year, mostly for export. Two of Honda's three plants remain closed. Other manufacturers have also reported major damage to their factories, with Kirin Holdings, Fuji Heavy Industries, GlaxoSmithKline and Nestlé among those to halt operations. Sony, the electronics group, has suspended production at eight plants. At one plant, 1,000 workers had to take refuge on the second floor after the tsunami hit. All ports have been closed amid warnings of aftershocks to come. Japan's utilities providers are warning of rolling blackouts across the country in the coming days because they are unable to meet electricity demand. Nuclear power generates about a third of the country's electricity but six reactor units at Fukushima remain offline indefinitely. An estimated 2 million homes are without power and about 1.4 million do not have running water. Equecat, a risk consultancy, estimated over the weekend that the economic losses from this earthquake would total more than $100bn (£62bn). Analysts said one of the Bank of Japan's priorities was to advance \"soft\" loans to commercial banks to make sure they do not run out of cash as customers in the affected areas rush to withdraw savings. The central bank is expected to flood money markets with more cash than usual, partly to stop the yen from rising too much. Japanese firms and investors are racing to repatriate their assets, selling dollars and other foreign currencies, to prepare for the cost of rebuilding their domestic economy, which will push up the yen's value. It is feared this will make exports more expensive and choke off the hoped-for, export-led recovery. David Buik at BGC partners said: \"The Bank of Japan, I am sure, will be on high alert, doing everything in its power to stop the yen becoming too strong, as well as providing the banking sector with all the liquidity it may require. \"Japan's economy is export-led. So with such an inordinately large budget deficit, it will be imperative to get those factories open again.\" The bank has little scope to cut interest rates, as they are almost at zero. Economists said the bank was likely to hold fire on more drastic action while it assesses the economic impact 0f the disaster. Daiwa Capital Markets, the Japanese-owned bank, said it was likely the economy would be pushed into recession, with exports particularly badly hit. Economists had expected growth of 0.3% this quarter but now expect a second successive quarter of negative growth. The huge cost of rebuilding the affected areas will push up Japan's public debt, which is already the largest among advanced economies. The Nikkei index, which fell 1.7% on Friday, is expected to post large falls when it reopens as the scale of the damage becomes clear. Some analysts warned it could tumble below the psychologically important 10,000 mark, which would represent a 2.7% drop from Friday's close, with one analyst at Toyota Asset Management telling Reuters it could fall below 9,000 soon. Oil prices, which fell by 3% on Friday, are likely to continue falling this week. Japan is the one of the world's largest importers of oil but demand is likely to drop as industrial activity falters. Strategists have been analysing the economic impact of Japan's last major earthquake, in 1995 near Kobe, for clues. The Nikkei fell 8% in the first five days after that earthquake but then rose by 5% in the next 10 days. After the initial disruption, the economy grew by more than the trend growth rate at the time for 1995 and 1996."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/sep/25/obama-un-general-assembly-transcript","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-25T15:03:00Z","webTitle":"President Obama's speech to the UN general assembly – full transcript","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/obama-un-general-assembly-transcript","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/sep/25/obama-un-general-assembly-transcript","fields":{"headline":"President Obama's speech to the UN general assembly – full transcript","bodyText":"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman: I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens. Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in Morocco. He came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East, and he would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria; from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked – tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic and listening with a broad smile. Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship. As America's representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for a future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. After the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections, built new institutions, and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship. Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and saw dignity in the people he met. Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That's when America's compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city he helped to save. He was 52 years old. I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but stood up for a set of principles – a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity. The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and the Libyan people. And there should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region – including Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen – have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities, and called for calm. So have religious authorities around the globe. But the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded – the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; and that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens. If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy; or to put out statements of regret, and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of this crisis. Because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart, and the hopes we hold in common. Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations. It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that has taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change. We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspirations of men and women who took to the streets. We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy put us on the side of the people. We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were not being served by a corrupt status quo. We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the U.N. Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents; and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant. And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop, and a new dawn can begin. We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. These are not simply American values or Western values – they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges that come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world. So let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians, and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair. This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab World. Over the past year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society; a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament; and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the right to determine their future. And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said: \"to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\" True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear; on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people. In other words, true democracy – real freedom – is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissent. In hard economic times, countries may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform. Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress – dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend upon the status quo; and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia; from Africa to the Americas; from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we've witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order. At times, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of faith, race or tribe; and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others. That is what we saw play out the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well – for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and religion. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion – we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them. I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. The answer is enshrined in our laws: our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. Moreover, as President of our country, and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so. Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views – even views that we disagree with. We do so not because we support hateful speech, but because our Founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of each individual to express their own views, and practice their own faith, may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can become a tool to silence critics, or oppress minorities. We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech – the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect. I know that not all countries in this body share this understanding of the protection of free speech. Yet in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how we respond. And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence. There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There is no video that justifies an attack on an Embassy. There is no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan. More broadly, the events of the last two weeks speak to the need for all of us to address honestly the tensions between the West and an Arab World moving to democracy. Just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not, and will not, seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad, and we do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue. Nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks, or the hateful speech by some individuals, represents the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims– any more than the views of the people who produced this video represent those of Americans. However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders, in all countries, to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those who – even when not resorting to violence – use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel as a central principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes excuses, for those who resort to violence. That brand of politics – one that pits East against West; South against North; Muslim against Christian, Hindu, and Jew – cannot deliver the promise of freedom. To the youth, it offers only false hope. Burning an American flag will do nothing to educate a child. Smashing apart a restaurant will not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an Embassy won't create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children and creating the opportunities they deserve; protecting human rights, and extending democracy's promise. Understand that America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends. We will stand with our allies and are willing to partner with countries to deepen ties of trade and investment; science and technology; energy and development – efforts that can spark economic growth for all of our people, and stabilize democratic change. But such efforts depend upon a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No government or company; no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnership to be effective, our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed. A politics based only on anger –one based on dividing the world between us and them – not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to these forces. Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than ten Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana'a; and several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul. The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same impulses toward extremism are used to justify war between Sunnis and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. Extremists understand this. And because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They do not build, they only destroy. It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. We cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future. The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt – it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted \"Muslims, Christians, we are one.\" The future must not belong to those who bully women – it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources – it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs; workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the men and women that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support. The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shiite pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of Gandhi: \"Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.\" Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, and that is the vision we will support. Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, and those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard but the destination is clear – a secure, Jewish state of Israel; and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey. In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence. Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision – a Syria that is united and inclusive; where children don't need to fear their own government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed – Sunnis and Alawites; Kurds and Christians. That is what America stands for; that is the outcome that we will work for – with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute; and assistance and support for those who work for this common good. Because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and legitimacy to lead. In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian government props up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful, and to meet its obligations to the United Nations. Let me be clear: America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That is why this institution was established from the rubble of conflict; that is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the Cold War; and that is the lesson of the last two decades as well. History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices. Nations in every part of the world have travelled this hard path. Europe – the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century – is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa; from Turkey to South Korea; from India to Indonesia; people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations. And it is because of the progress I've witnessed that after nearly four years as President, I am hopeful about the world we live in. The war in Iraq is over, and our troops have come home. We have begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. I've seen hard choices made – from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan – to put more power in the hands of citizens. At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G-20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent. New commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking. But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of leaders – it is the people I've seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away. The students in Jakarta and Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit humankind. The faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations. The young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the globe who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity. So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That's what we see on the news, and that consumes our political debates. But when you strip that all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes from faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people – and not the other way around. The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people, and all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. And that is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life. And today I promise you this – long after these killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens' legacy will live on in the lives he touched. In the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook FB 0.00% photo to one of Chris; in the sign that read, simply, \"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.\" They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it justice will be done; that history is on our side; and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed.

The centre-right government wants the new reactors to be built to replace the country's 10 existing stations. The decision reverses a 1980 referendum when the majority of voters backed an end to nuclear expansion and the government pledged to phase out nuclear power plants. But public support has grown since nuclear power has been repositioned as a low carbon energy source and a weapon in the fight against climate change. The decision by Sweden to back nuclear power contrasts with the nation's careful cultivation of its green image. In 2006, Sweden pledged to replace the use of all fossil fuels by 2020, but nuclear was not part of that plan. Finland is currently the only country in the EU building a nuclear reactor. Its new Olkiluoto plant is being built in partnership with a consortium led by France's state-owned energy company, Areva. The project has been beset by delays and cost overuns, however, and is unlikely to be completed until 2012, three years behind schedule. In the UK Gordon Brown's government is enthusiastic about building a new generation of reactors, arguing that both tackling global warming and ensuring security of energy supply are critical. German power giants E.ON and RWE are jointly bidding to build three stations, while EDF's takeover of British Energy has paved the way for it to construct a fleet of new atomic stations in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2011/apr/02/children-light-electricity-gavin-weightman-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T23:05:04Z","webTitle":"Children of Light by Gavin Weightman – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/02/children-light-electricity-gavin-weightman-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/apr/02/children-light-electricity-gavin-weightman-review","fields":{"headline":"Children of Light by Gavin Weightman – review","bodyText":"Regulation 244/2009, a recent EU directive, has determined that the sale of filament light bulbs will be illegal soon after the end of 2012. \"It is fitting,\" Gavin Weightman writes in this illuminating book, \"that the incandescent lamp, among the clutter of electrical appliances now found in nearly every home, should be singled out.\" Why? Because \"it was the proliferation of the filament bulb . . . that created the demand for electricity in large quantities. Though electric lighting is just one demand on modern power stations, which supply current to a huge range of domestic appliances as well as to industry and transport, it remains hugely significant.\" The invention and development of the light bulb, so long a friend and so recently an enemy, dominates the first half of Weightman's electric adventure. Although popular history books still cite the brilliant American, Thomas Alva Edison, as the inventor of the light bulb, its story is much more complex, and enjoyably so. Edison, a natural salesman who enchanted the media, was just one of the many highly charged characters who did their bit to make the light bulb more commonplace than wax candles had ever been before them. Edison also advocated the electric chair for executions; it took eight cruel minutes to kill its first victim – William Kemmler, a New York axe-murderer – in August 1890. The first light bulbs to be switched on, in private and public, were those devised not by Edison, but by Joseph Wilson Swan, the Sunderland-born son of a ship's chandler. Swan developed his bulbs between 1860 and 1880. They first went on sale in 1881 at 25s a pop, or about £60 in today's money. Early electric light was not for the poor. The first electrically lit house in Britain was Cragside, designed by Richard Norman Shaw for Sir William Armstrong, the immensely rich Tyneside engineering magnate and armaments manufacturer. But, as Weightman makes clear, the story of the light bulb that triggered the huge demand for electricity in this country begins with Alessandro Volta, Italian inventor of the battery in 1800. Even then, Volta said his invention was indebted to, among others, Abraham Bennett, the 18th-century English clergyman who invented the gold-leaf electroscope. The way in which the light bulb switched on an entire industry is the stuff of sensation. One day, it seems, Britain was all tallow, town gas, smoke and Stygian gloom; before long it was as bright as Blackpool illuminations. At first, the spread of electricity through Britain was rapid; but, as Weightman explains, the newborn industry was just as quickly troubled by political problems, along with tough competition from the gas industry and the confusion caused by the proliferation of early generating plants. The first of these was in Godalming, Surrey. Powered by the temperamental flow of the River Wey, it provided uncertain electricity. If this seems an unlikely start to what, eventually, was to become the national grid, then what about London's first generating station? With dynamos powered by pounding steam engines, this was in the basement of the Grosvenor Gallery in Bond Street. Cranked up to full power by the young Sebastian Ferranti, its overhead cables strung across West End roof tops brought electric light as far as Regent's Park and Lincoln's Inn Fields. When in 1884 Charles Algernon Parsons, youngest son of the third Earl of Rosse, the distinguished Anglo-Irish astronomer, invented the steam turbine, electricity began to flow as never before. The steam turbine gave us the giant power stations that, whether powered by coal, oil or enriched uranium, provide us with the stupendous flow of electricity we demand to make our supposedly environmentally aware world, and all its gizmos, work for us today. Weightman reminds us that the draconian measures needed to create a harmonised and truly national grid were the work of a Conservative government. Stanley Baldwin's administration drove through the 1926 Electricity (Supply) Act that gave us, within just five and a half years, the basis of today's national grid. And a wincingly bad poem about pylons by Stephen Spender. From then on, Weightman's story courses through nuclear power, undersea power cables, the miners' strike, the privatisation of the grid, to our obsession with electric-powered gadgets and the prohibition of the filament light bulb that sparked his tale. We do tend to take electricity for granted. We should know its story. Gavin Weightman tells it well.

Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to Washington, warned senior Nato military officials that the existence of such a device \"would compel Saudi Arabia … to pursue policies which could lead to untold and possibly dramatic consequences\". He did not state explicitly what these policies would be, but a senior official in Riyadh who is close to the prince said yesterday his message was clear. \"We cannot live in a situation where Iran has nuclear weapons and we don't. It's as simple as that,\" the official said. \"If Iran develops a nuclear weapon, that will be unacceptable to us and we will have to follow suit.\" Officials in Riyadh said that Saudi Arabia would reluctantly push ahead with its own civilian nuclear programme. Peaceful use of nuclear power, Turki said, was the right of all nations. Turki was speaking earlier this month at an unpublicised meeting at RAF Molesworth, the airbase in Cambridgeshire used by Nato as a centre for gathering and collating intelligence on the Middle East and the Mediterranean. According to a transcript of his speech obtained by the Guardian, Turki told his audience that Iran was a \"paper tiger with steel claws\" that was \"meddling and destabilising\" across the region. \"Iran … is very sensitive about other countries meddling in its affairs. But it should treat others like it expects to be treated. The kingdom expects Iran to practise what it preaches,\" Turki said. Turki holds no official post in Saudi Arabia but is seen as an ambassador at large for the kingdom and a potential future foreign minister, Diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks and published by the Guardian last year revealed that King Abdullah, who has ruled Saudi Arabia since 2005, had privately warned Washington in 2008 that if Iran developed nuclear weapons \"everyone in the region would do the same, including Saudi Arabia\". Saudi Arabian diplomats and officials have launched a serious campaign in recent weeks to rally global and regional powers against Iran, fearful that their country's larger but poorer regional rival is exploiting the Arab Spring to gain influence in the region and within the kingdom itself. Turki also accused Iran of interfering in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and in the Gulf state of Bahrain, where Saudi troops were deployed this year as part of a Gulf Co-operation Council force following widespread protests from those calling for greater democratic rights. Though there has previously been little public comment from Riyadh on developments in Syria, Turki told his audience at Molesworth that President Bashar al-Assad \"will cling to power till the last Syrian is killed\". Syria presents a dilemma for Saudi policymakers: although they would prefer not to see popular protest unseat another regime in the region, they view the Damascus regime, which is dominated by members of Syria's Shia minority, as a proxy for Iran. \"The loss of life [in Syria] in the present internal struggle is deplorable. The government is woefully deficient in its handling of the situation,\" Turki said at the Molesworth meeting, which took place on 8 June. Though analysts say demonstrations in Bahrain were not sectarian in nature, two senior Saudi officials in Riyadh said this week that Tehran had mobilised the largely Shia protesters against the Sunni rulers of the Gulf state. Iran has a predominantly Shia population. Around 15% of Saudis are Shia. The officials described this minority, which suffers extensive discrimination despite recent attempts at reform, as \"vulnerable to external influence\". Though there has been negligible unrest internally, Saudi Arabia has been shaken by the events across the Arab world in recent months and has watched anxiously as a number of allies – such as President Hosni Mubarak – have been ousted or have found themselves in grave difficulties. President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen is being treated in a Saudi Arabian hospital for wounds caused by a mysterious blast that forced him to leave his country this month. The former Tunisian ruler Zine al-Abedine ben Ali, whose relations with Riyadh were complex, is reported to have been housed in a luxurious villa in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah after he fled his homeland for Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials admitted that decision-makers in Saudi Arabia were \"not keen\" on demonstrators ousting governments, but said they were \"even less keen on killing and massacres\". Turki also warned that al-Qaida has been able to create \"a sanctuary not unlike Pakistan's tribal areas\" in Yemen. Saudi Arabian foreign policy historically has been pro-western, although differences have emerged with the United States in recent years. The Arab Spring has also caused some tension, with the deployment of troops in Bahrain opposed by Washington. There has also been conflict following western charges that the kingdom has exported radical strands of Islam around the Muslim world.Turki said that \"in all areas, Islam must play a central yet development role\" and insisted that \"closer monitoring\" now ensured that funds raised in the kingdom \"were not misused\". Internally, Saudi Arabia faced problems because of the youthfulness of its population, radicalism and different sectarian identities, Turki said. Senior officials at the ministry of interior in Riyadh said that Iran was using ideology to \"penetrate\" the Arabian peninsula \"in the same way al-Qaida did\". Turki also reiterated a long-standing Saudi call for a nuclear free zone in the Middle East, which would include both Iran and Israel and would be enforced by the United Nations security council. The prince said sanctions against Iran were working. He welcomed the consensus in Washington that military strikes against Tehran would be counterproductive. Analysts said that Turki's words about developing nuclear arms may have been intended to focus western attention on Saudi concerns about their regional rival rather than to indicate any kind of definite decision by Riyadh because the practical and diplomatic obstacles of doing so would be immense. William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary said that Iran has recently conducted covert tests of ballistic missiles as well as at least three secret tests of medium-range ballistic missiles since October. Iran and the west remain in dispute over its nuclear programme. The US and its allies insist Tehran aims to develop atomic weapons, a charge that Iran rejects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/dec/01/kazakhstan-nuclear-future","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-01T15:47:56Z","webTitle":"As memories of Soviet tests fade, Kazakhstan looks to nuclear future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/01/kazakhstan-nuclear-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/01/kazakhstan-nuclear-future","fields":{"headline":"As memories of Soviet tests fade, Kazakhstan looks to nuclear future","bodyText":"More than half a century has passed, but the scene is still etched in her mind. \"I saw it from the street in front of my house,\" said Proskovya Koloskova, 85. \"There was a flash like white lightning, then a great cup of fire rising into the sky with black smoke spilling out from the sides and tongues of red flame.\" The year was 1954 and Koloskova, a farm worker, was witnessing one of the Soviet Union's first detonations of an atomic bomb. Between 1949 and 1989 the Red Army tested more than 450 nuclear weapons here on the vast sun-scorched steppes of eastern Kazakhstan. Erratic winds blew streamers of toxic fallout toward villages on the edge of the test ground, known as the poligon. Even today, the horrors of the Semipalatinsk test site are still palpable. At a small orphanage in nearby Semey, two toddlers lie in cots. Their heads are deformed to enormous size, their eyes flutter upwards into their sockets. Nurses believe they are victims of contamination caused by the nuclear experiments. On a tour of Semey, organised and paid for by the Kazakh government, the Guardian was shown a cancer clinic where a new \"nuclear medicine\" department is soon to be built — and a cabinet of misshapen babies in pickling jars at the city's medical university. The genetic consequences of radiation exposure are disputed but doctors say cancer rates in eastern Kazakhstan are 50% higher than the national average. Koloskova's youngest son died aged 44 after severe kidney problems. \"Maybe the tests were to blame,\" she said. But while Kazakhstan laments its grisly nuclear past, it is rapidly constructing a nuclear future. This week the country has been flaunting its energy wares as leaders from 56 countries – including Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, and the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton – gather in the capital, Astana, for a summit of the regional security organisation, the OSCE. China, Russia and Europe are already jockeying for access to the Central Asian state's huge reserves of oil and natural gas. Now bountiful supplies of uranium to fuel a new generation of nuclear power plants are another energy target. Last year Kazakhstan leapfrogged Australia and Canada to become the world's largest producer of uranium. The metal is extracted by leaching from boreholes, concentrated and then converted into yellowcake. In 2009 the country produced 13,900 tonnes of uranium, more than a quarter of global output. Kazakhstan's rebranding comes at a time of reviving interest in nuclear power worldwide, with even some prominent greens calling it a crucial source of carbon-free energy. At times the sinister legacy of the Semipalatinsk explosions feels like a sideshow. In Kurchatov, the former closed town on the edge of the poligon that was once home to thousands of researchers working on the Soviet bomb, scientists offer visitors an excursion through the former test ground. The spot where blasts were detonated is now a quiet patch of steppe dotted with wormwood, 40 miles west of Kurchatov. Fanning out from the epicentre are disintegrating concrete towers that housed equipment to measure the force of the explosions. Round pebbles of molten rock lie scattered on the ground. A dosimeter shows radiation at the epicentre is 30 times higher than background level. But Yury Strilchuk, a radioecologist who leads the excursions, says there is little danger: \"You could suffer more from the stress of worrying about coming here than from radiation itself.\" Some of the scientists swim and catch fish in a nearby pond called Atomic Lake, claiming they suffer no ill effects. A long-term project to monitor contamination of grasses is largely redundant because herders already graze their animals on the poligon without censure. While the painful nuclear past occupies a hallowed place in national identity, what Kazakhstan really cares about now is its nuclear rebirth. President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered an end to testing in 1991, three years before the country gave up its nuclear weapons arsenal, which was the fourth largest in the world. Kurchatov – named after Igor Kurchatov, the Russian nuclear physicist – was left almost deserted. Today many of the town's apartment blocks are still boarded up, but there are signs of a renaissance. The stuccoed buildings in the central square have been spruced up and work is trickling back. \"Kurchatov is coming alive again,\" says Dzhambulat Gilmanov, the chief specialist at the National Nuclear Centre, which occupies one side of the square. Down the road in a hangar, engineers are testing a Tokamak materials reactor, a bus-sized grey cylinder festooned with pipes and wires. Next door is a sprawling \"nuclear technopark\" where employees irradiate building materials and sterilise medical equipment using an electron accelerator. The uranium business is the real muscle behind the revival. The World Nuclear Association said in a report last year that it expects a global shift to nuclear projects will lead to a 59% increase in demand for uranium by 2030. French, Canadian and Japanese companies have already signed joint ventures to exploit Kazakhstan's reserves. Some investors may yet be cautious of following suit. In March a court in Astana sentenced Mukhtar Dzhakishev, the former head of state nuclear firm Kazatomprom, to 14 years in prison for embezzlement and the illegal sale of assets to foreign companies. Kazakh politics are vapid – President Nazarbayev has preserved his authoritarian rule for 19 years and shows no sign of budging – but observers say Dzhakishev was probably the victim of a clash between factions inside government. The US diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks this week show that the US ambassador to Astana, Richard Hoagland, believes the Kazkah elite is riddled with corruption, as rivals battle for control of the energy spoils. Senior officials \"receive profits from businesses registered in the names of their spouses or other relatives,\" he writes in a cable to Washington. \"In other cases, they're stealing directly from the public trough.\" As for ordinary Kazakhs, many are ambivalent about the nuclear renaissance, which includes plans to store enriched fuel in the east of the country. \"I'm against it,\" said a military officer in Semey. \"We've suffered enough. Please, no more dead fish in our rivers.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/aug/21/greenbelt-threat-permissive-planning-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-20T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"Activists prepare for battle to save countryside from the developers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/21/greenbelt-threat-permissive-planning-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/aug/21/greenbelt-threat-permissive-planning-laws","fields":{"headline":"Activists prepare for battle to save countryside from the developers","bodyText":"Down in the marshlands of Kent, battle lines are being drawn. In Lydd, a historic gateway town near the headland of Dungeness – a desolate moonscape of gravel dunes, bungalows and tundra – the people are angry. They are angry at proposals to build more homes on the edge of town at a time when younger inhabitants are moving away. They are angry at plans to develop a series of quarries that will have conveyor belts running all night. And they are angry about the airport. Local heritage and environmental groups warn that plans to expand Lydd's tiny airport – now used by private jets, cargo planes and Lydd Air, which flies to Le Touquet in France – will dramatically alter the haunting atmosphere of the marshlands, designated an area of outstanding natural beauty. The RSPB claims pollution and the use of bird-strike controls to protect passenger planes carrying between 200,000 and two million people a year will be devastating for the area's wildlife. There are concerns, too, that the flight path poses a security risk to Dungeness nuclear power station and a primary school about 600 metres from where the planes would land. Posters proclaiming \"No big jets\" are displayed in windows around town. But walk past the houses with their \"For Sale\" signs, the closed-down ironmongers, the glassless telephone box and the vandalised memorial garden, and it is clear opposition to airport expansion is far from unanimous. \"We really need the airport to be developed,\" said Jean Jones, who runs the Two Bob Shop on the High Street. \"There's no employment here for the youngsters; they're leaving or causing trouble. The bank's closed down and there are fewer shops. People do their shopping in Romney Marsh now. This town is dying.\" Shepway council agreed and approved plans to develop the airport, owned by a Saudi businessman, Sheikh Fahad al-Athel, but in the face of opposition the government referred it to the planning inspectorate. The ultimate decision will rest with Eric Pickles, secretary of state for communities and local government. Those in favour claim Lydd, also known as London Ashford airport, can already take big jets. Two years ago, 23 jumbos bound for Gatwick landed at the airport due to thick fog. In the 1950s the airport, then known as Silver City, flew tens of thousands of passengers and their cars to mainland Europe. \"This would create up to 1,000 jobs,\" said Jean's husband, Bob, a parish councillor and leading light in the Friends of Lydd Airport Group, who believes that the 200 or so jobs it is claimed would be created at the airport would themselves generate hundreds more. \"The whole marsh is dying. This is the most deprived area in southern England. Folkestone and Ashford are getting money, but there is nothing here.\" But Bob and Jean are optimistic: \"In this economic climate it's got to get the go-ahead.\" It's a view shared by local Conservative MP Damian Collins, whose blog champions the government's plan for growth, which he claims will bring \"radical changes to the planning system to support job creation\". Collins knows which way the wind is blowing. The government is determined that \"sustainable growth\" takes centre stage in the planning process. Its national planning policy framework, unveiled last month, repeatedly confirms that planning must be seen as a tool of economic growth, an emphasis seized on by developers and housing experts. \"It's possibly the most useful thing the coalition government has done,\" said David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, which represents England's social housing providers. \"For too long the scales have been tipped in favour of those opposed [to development].\" Orr knows the figures better than most. Last year about 100,000 homes were built in Britain, but most experts agree there is a need to build about 250,000 homes a year to cater for the country's burgeoning population. The government's new framework recognises this shortfall, instructing local authorities to update their five-year house-building plans and to increase their construction targets by 20%. Although only a draft, it is already governing decisions. Planning officers have been told to recognise that it is of \"material consideration\" when considering applications. Decisions that have been rejected are being reprised as developers anticipate that the coalition's pro-growth development strategy will allow them to override previous objections. This is the concern of locals in Slad Valley, Gloucestershire – Laurie Lee country – close to where Barratt Homes hopes to build 48 houses, 30% of which will be allocated to affordable housing. Stroud council rejected the plan, but the new framework suggests the development could yet see the green light. \"It's almost certain they will appeal,\" said Geoffrey Murray, chairman of the Stroud district branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE). \"They [the developers] know that the council have got to hit these 20% extra targets.\" Crucially, it has been estimated that as few as 5% of councils will have up-to-date development plans by next April when the new framework is due to come into force. This is important. The government has signalled that councils failing to meet the deadline will be assumed to be in favour of a \"permissive planning system\". Or, as John Howell MP, parliamentary private secretary to Greg Clark, the minister of state for decentralisation, explained in January, developers will be able to build \"what they like, where they like and when they like\", provided they meet new planning guidelines. Unsurprisingly, conservation groups have expressed alarm at the \"permissive\" emphasis, which they believe is driven chiefly by the Treasury. The likes of the National Trust and the CPRE are alarmed that the framework dispenses with guidance stressing development of brownfield sites should come before greenfield, and that it contains no commitment to respect the \"intrinsic value\" of the countryside. As a result, they warn developers will \"cherry-pick\" cheaper greenfield sites at the expense of brownfield. Greenery around towns and villages will simply disappear, they say. But it will not happen without a fight. The National Trust is canvassing its 3.7 million members as it prepares its response. Prominent campaigners, such as comedian Griff Rhys Jones, have joined the fray, warning the new framework will \"slash, burn and rampage through current planning laws\". There is talk that the escalating row will go the way of the government's attempts to sell off the nation's forests. So far the government has dismissed the objections, claiming the framework reiterates a commitment to protecting the greenbelt and areas of outstanding natural beauty. Planning minister Bob Neill has gone as far to suggest the objections are the work of a \"carefully choreographed smear campaign by leftwingers based in the national headquarters of pressure groups\" – a charge rejected by those at whom it was targeted. \"We are not against development,\" said Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the CPRE, who is critical of Labour for not providing an \"adequate response\" to the row. \"We accept planning needs to be streamlined. But there's no evidence this framework will kickstart the economy. Where is the advantage in introducing the sort of planning system seen in Portugal, Greece and Ireland?\" Orr rejects the concerns: \"This will not result in a concreting over of the countryside. Period.\" But many Tory backbenchers are aware that the row could affect their core support and it is rumoured that the government will seek an NHS-style \"listening exercise\" in the autumn to try to defuse the situation. The government knows it is not the leftwingers it needs to fear. It is middle England. And it's ready for a fight. • The following correction was published in the Observer on 28 August 2011: \"Activists prepare for battle to save countryside from the developers\" (News) claimed Lydd airport in Kent, \"can already take big jets. Two years ago, 23 jumbos bound for Gatwick landed at the airport due to thick fog\". Lydd's runway does not have that capability.

The congress was on a scale unimaginable anywhere else in the world – thousands crowded into huge white tents to hear lectures by physicists and rocket scientists, while wide-eyed schoolchildren posed for photographs with Nobel prize winners. Enthusiasm wasn't even weakened by the midday heat, which caused some visitors to faint while queueing for a nuclear power and space exhibition. It was there last year that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, made clear India's big plan for its technological future: There's no doubt about it: the country is furiously pursuing development through science and technology. The aim is to more than double investment in research and development, which could put it in the same league as Japan and the US. Most industrialised countries spend around 2% of GDP on research and development. Right now, India spends 0.8%, placing it alongside South Africa and Brazil. By next year it hopes to ramp this up to 1.2%, and in the longer term is determined to reach 2% – well ahead of China, on 1.5%. The UK, which spends around 1.8%, is freezing its science budget in cash terms for the next four years (which means a fall in real terms). So India's trajectory could eventually see it outpace Britain – once the world's science powerhouse. And it's a trajectory reflected in the rise of the world's 11th largest economy, with a GDP growth rate of around 9% – putting India hot on the heels of Russia and Canada, and already wealthier than Australia and Spain. This might sound surprising to some: India has about as many illiterate adults as the entire US population, and even I needed convincing that it really does have the ingredients to become a science superpower. But although it's true that many laboratories are rough and ready, and IT companies tend to focus more on back-office outsourcing for western firms than in-house innovation, India's scientific revolution has already begun. Among the 600,000 engineering graduates produced every year is a growing cohort of innovative geeks. In the months following last year's congress, I travelled the length of India, from the rural cotton belt to slick IT parks. I saw how expertise in western software really is starting to transform into a culture of originality. In Delhi and Bengaluru young entrepreneurs are developing a voice-based internet, which promises to both localise the web to the smallest communities and make it accessible to anyone with a simple mobile phone. Bangaluru has regular meet-ups for design and tech folk, the buzzing environment reminding them of Silicon Valley. This is one of the reasons that India's software industry is set to be worth $12bn by 2015. Though most Indian laboratories struggle for high-quality equipment, hundreds of biomedical scientists are pooling research to develop what may be the first effective cure for tuberculosis (which kills two Indians every three minutes) in 40 years. The Open Source Drug Discovery project, funded by the government on a fraction of what Big Pharma would require, is creating the world's biggest online repository of information about the TB bacterium and how to combat it. The engineering sector saw a growth in job creation of 63% last year, according to India's Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry. And in the coming year, India is expected to create between 10 and 15 million jobs, particularly in biotechnology and IT. As in Japan decades earlier, scientists are creatively overcoming shortfalls in resources to ensure quality of research; and engineers are inventing cheap technologies for the benefit of everyday people. India has become a nation of passionate, hard-working geeks. The focus of last year's congress was India's ambition to send an astronaut into space by 2015. A manned mission may may seem like an extravagance for an emerging economy, but it's just another sign of a nation that can already see the time when states will need a presence in space to assert claims to extraplanetary resources. The west may think India is still in the gutter, but it is looking at the stars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/24/george-osborne-budget-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-24T10:56:23Z","webTitle":"George Osborne's budget is a betrayal of our environment | Caroline Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/24/george-osborne-budget-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/24/george-osborne-budget-environment","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne's budget is a betrayal of our environment","bodyText":"The first full budget from a government claiming to be the \"greenest ever\" is a betrayal of our environment and our future. In his determination to balance the nation's finances, George Osborne has forgotten that living within our means is also about natural resources. This budget is an attempt to return us to the failed policies of the past – unsustainable growth based on dwindling and ever-more expensive resources. The chance to turn environmental necessity to our economic and social advantage has once again gone begging. Overall, Wednesday's budget continues the course charted last June. Repaying debt remains Osborne's prime objective – despite growing evidence that this is draining the life-blood from the economy and risking rises in both unemployment and prices. His methods, too, come straight from the 1920s – across the board cuts in public spending. This is not only bad economics – it is also a huge missed opportunity. Between the extremes of Tory kill-to-be-kind austerity and a return to Labour's debt-fuelled spend-a-thon lies a more subtle alternative: avoiding savage cuts in public spending that could trigger a new recession, but also concentrating that spending where it has the maximum economic, social and environmental benefit. The environment provides the clearest example of how this would work in practice. Even before the current economic crisis had fully developed, the \"green deal\" was showing how money invested in energy-saving measures could sustain far more jobs than other forms of government spending, and also contribute to reducing fuel poverty, improving health and tackling climate change. Today, the arguments in favour are stronger, particularly with hikes in regressive taxes such as VAT and cuts in benefits and services leaving the poorest even more vulnerable. The chancellor had five opportunities to deliver a budget for the future, that could have turned the growing crisis over energy resources and climate change into a catalyst for creating much-needed jobs and wealth in new energy efficiency and renewable industries. They are: • The green investment bank: This should have been the key to unlocking the £450bn in finance for renewable energy needed in the next 15 years. Instead, by creating a bank that cannot borrow, its impact will be limited to the original £3bn funding. • Transport: Taxing the excess profits of North Sea oil companies is welcome; but the revenue should have been used to protect rural bus services, which are even more crucial to isolated communities and the poorest in society than the cost of fuel. • Environmental taxes: Despite pledging more \"green taxes\", scrapping the planned rise in air passenger duty will reduce revenue from environmental taxes by £145m. It will also encourage more people to holiday abroad, hitting UK resorts. • Carbon floor prices: At £30 a tonne, the new levy on carbon will not promote much low-carbon energy, but it will give nuclear power companies a windfall subsidy of between £1.3bn and £3bn – paid for by the \"hard-pressed families\" that Osborne claims he wants to help. • Zero-carbon homes: The chancellor has changed the rules so that supposedly \"zero-carbon\" homes would in fact create carbon emissions for years to come. It will also undermine many community energy schemes. If this wasn't enough bad news for the environment, the chancellor announced changes to the planning system that are likely to weaken the protection for the countryside, putting precious landscapes and habitats at even greater risk. This budget contains nothing to shift us away from our dependency on oil and gas, nothing to take advantage of the potential of new technologies such as wind, wave and tide, and precious little to encourage investment in renewable industries. Instead, he has gone for the populist gesture of 1p off fuel duty. It gives drivers the false comfort that as fuel prices rise, the government will cut fuel duty. The reality is that petrol is a dwindling resource and we need to help people with alternatives, such as public transport. While Osborne could find £2bn for petrol, there was not a penny today for buses or trains. The depressing truth is that, rather than being the greenest government ever, this Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition is less green than John Major's government, which introduced the fuel duty escalator, boosted energy efficiency and protection for threatened habitats. Even Margaret Thatcher accepted the need for action on climate change. Osborne wanted to put fuel in the tank of the British economy. No doubt he will get the headlines he wants. But the reality is that he, like Mr Toad, is speeding down a dead-end road. Oil will not last for ever. The sooner we can reduce our dependence, the better for us all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/sep/18/britain-nuclear-privatised-babcock","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-18T10:04:20Z","webTitle":"Britain's nuclear caretaker privatised in Babcock sale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/18/britain-nuclear-privatised-babcock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/sep/18/britain-nuclear-privatised-babcock","fields":{"headline":"Britain's nuclear caretaker privatised in Babcock sale","bodyText":"The body responsible for decommissioning and cleaning up Britain's fleet of nuclear power stations was sold today in the latest privatisation of part of the UK's nuclear industry. UKAEA, the commercial arm of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, has been bought by Babcock International Group for £50m. Business secretary Lord Mandelson claimed the deal \"generates good value for taxpayers\", but opposition politicians have previously voiced concerns over the sale. UKAEA is currently carrying out decommissioning work at Dounreay in Scotland, Winfrith in Dorset, and Harwell in Oxfordshire. It also operates training programmes, and offers consultancy services to other countries. It has been on the market for almost six months. Babcock, which is listed on the FTSE 250 index, already runs the UK's only nuclear refuelling facilities for its nuclear submarine fleet, at Devonport in Plymouth. \"The high level of skills and expertise in UKAEA will further accelerate the growth of our nuclear business,\" said Babcock's chief executive, Peter Rogers. Back in March, when Mandelson put UKAEA up for sale, the shadow energy secretary, Greg Clark, said it could be a short-term move to bring cash into the government's books. \"The government has awarded contracts worth millions of pounds to UKAEA for decommissioning nuclear power stations and is reliant on the company to deliver them. The government must have cast-iron guarantees that any buyer will not hold the taxpayer to ransom for further payments for decommissioning Dounreay, Harwell and Winfrith,\" Clark warned. The task of cleaning up after more than half a century of nuclear power is expected to cost Britain at least £83bn. The size of the challenge was underlined last year when the firm operating the Sellafield nuclear site appealed for former workers to come forward if they remembered where they had deposited nuclear waste. UKAEA's waste management expertise could also be valuable when the next generation of UK nuclear power stations begins operating, possibly in 2017. British Energy, which runs eight nuclear power stations, was privatised in 1996, but had to be rescued by the taxpayer in 2002. It was taken over in 2008 by France's EDF, which plans to build four new reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2011/jun/01/european-cucumber-wars-shape-things","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-01T11:24:42Z","webTitle":"Are the European cucumber wars the shape of things to come? | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2011/jun/01/european-cucumber-wars-shape-things","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2011/jun/01/european-cucumber-wars-shape-things","fields":{"headline":"Are the European cucumber wars the shape of things to come?","bodyText":"What have dodgy cucumbers with added E coli got to do with the Greek debt crisis? Not much, unless you notice a tendency among irate Germans to lash out and blame their fellow Europeans when something bad happens. There's a lot of it about in these difficult times. Just look at this morning's wonky manufacturing figures. As the Guardian reports, German ministers backed down on Tuesday. \"Spanish cucumbers are not the cause,\" the federal agriculture minister conceded. Too late, alas, to prevent severe damage to Spain's food exports, its farm business and its already-battered labour force (unemployment is 21% and rising). This is another example of the risk that offset the benefits of having a highly integrated European market as part of an increasingly globalised economy. Wednesday's Guardian reported on British firms leading the pack – at last, we're No 1! – in buying up African acreage for biofuel development. Felicity Lawrence's agri report from Guatemala, whose history is more cruel than even Spain's, is another part of the bigger picture in which there are winners – such as British supermarket shoppers (so far) – and losers, although low wages should always be benchmarked against even lower ones, which may previously have existed locally. Let's stick to Europe for now. The Tunisian crisis has triggered a Mediterranean immigration panic (who predicted that?) which has seen Italy and France bickering. The Schengen Agreement on the free movement of EU citizens (Britain did not sign, but messed up in its own way) is also under pressure. In distant Scandinavia, notably within Finland's populist True Finn party but also in Denmark (I read that it takes its name from a Viking prince called Dan) and Sweden, xenophobic politics are resurfacing. France has the National Front, and even the gentle Netherlands is affected. Thank goodness Germany's inoculation against such tendencies still works 65 years after starting the course of treatment. But there are signs of frailty, as the burdens of being the EU's paymaster seem to outweigh the huge benefits that accrue to the thriving German economy. Cucumbers apart, the debt crisis is far from over. The IMF, which is a bit rudderless since Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned as managing director, is insisting the eurozone agrees to new loans to the waterlogged Greek economy in 2012. If not, the IMF won't risk its shareholders' money paying out the next tranche of the old loan, due on 29 June. The EU will probably blink between now and the next summit at the end of this month. But Chancellor Merkel's leadership is timid, and her coalition shaky. What else can explain Germany's fatuous decision to close down all its nuclear plants by 2022, as if buying French, and even Polish, nuclear power to fill gaps will make it either more virtuous or safer? So things could go wrong. That's what happens when systems are under stress, and mere mortals make mistakes. Balkan expert Misha Glenny penned a terrific piece in the FT this week which recalls how proud, imperial Europe collectively killed itself a century ago by error and miscalculation, not design. In the process, he argued how splendid it would be if the EU demonstrated enough statecraft to allow West Balkan states – not just Croatia and post-Mladic Serbia but minnows such as Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia – to join the EU in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the June 1914 shot at Sarajevo. This incident lit the Balkan \"powder keg\" and started the first world war. It is unlikely to happen. Creditor north European countries, and not just Germany, are feeling wary of debtors from the south and do not want to rush to embrace more. If anything, some would like to expel Greece from the eurozone. This is possibly the best answer for Greece, since it could devalue the revived drachma and have a hope of recovery – not currently evident. But it would hugely destabilise the euro at great cost, even in the short term. The evidence so far is that EU strategists will do anything to prevent this if they can. Greek voters may have to accept a loss of economic sovereignty to Brussels and Frankfurt (if not Berlin directly) and German voters' greater costs. Neither will enjoy it, and the EU moved to appease Greek feelings on Tuesday. But the presence of shaky economies inside the eurozone does bestow one benefit on German exports, which its citizens would be wise to remember. The euro may be high against sterling, still quite high against the (deliberately?) low US dollar – $1.42 against $1.60 at its peak – although not against the rock-solid Swiss franc. But in a German-dominated core eurozone, it would be much higher. Lots of good things are still going on in Europe due to the machinery of co-operation and integration painstakingly built up over many decades (even the courts are right sometimes), and it's usually best to look on the brighter side. If you want a spot of gloom, try reading Larry Elliott's Guardian column. With rising oil and commodity prices, an unbalanced UK economy and global warming, it's a miracle any of us can get out of bed in the morning. But most of us do. It's helpful to be realistic, which is something politicians get scolded for when they try. Vince Cable did recently in the Guardian, and Alistair Darling famously did when referring to the \"worst crisis in 60 years\" in August 2008. Balancing realism with long-term optimism is a very hard formulation. Churchill did it in his \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech of May 1940, when we were in REAL trouble. Subsequent prime ministers routinely try to pull off the trick again – \"short-term pain for long-term gain\" – just as David Cameron is doing now. In our pampered world, where we fall out over cucumbers, how well would we respond if our backs were seriously against a tottering wall. Better than we tell each other, I like to think.

Discussion of these parties' policies is often centred around devolution, but how do they perform on science? I also take a brief look at the BNP and the Christian Party towards the end of this article. Plaid Cymru's manifesto shows a business-minded attitude to science and technology, with pledges to upgrade Wales' IT infrastructure. On the environment it calls for nothing less than a 'green revolution', emphasising job creation and initiatives that enable communities to take part in projects suchs as small-scale energy production and community-based farming. Some leaders promise a Ferrari in every garage, Plaid Cymru promises a goat – and I highlight that as a compliment, although given the lack of efficiency of small farms I'm not sure how viable a strategy they are for curbing emissions. The SNP makes little mention of science in its manifesto, but has some interesting ideas on the environment, including a focus on preserving marine ecosystems, and an initiative to become a world leader in carbon storage. Unfortunately, the SNP did not respond to our questions, so where possible its views have been inferred from its manifesto, website and policy statements. Brian Cox: Science funding Do you plan to maintain Britain's science budget below the European average? Plaid Cymru's response continues the business-oriented theme evident in its manifesto, bringing the party surprisingly close to the Conservative and Labour positions, which seem to view science as primarily a tool for innovation in the economy. It's difficult to tell whether the lack of blue-sky thinking has ideological roots, or if it's simply the consequence of dealing with the needs of a much smaller nation with fewer resources to speculate with. The creation of a national academy is an interesting but slightly vague proposal. The centrepiece of the SNP's campaign is a pledge to protect Scotland from cuts to public services, including an attack on wasteful schemes such as ID cards. Having preserved Scotland's budget, it would then invest considerably in research, with the ambitious aim of creating 60,000 green jobs. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? The SNP supported patient access to alternative medicine in its 2007 manifesto. I couldn't find any similar mention in the 2010 campaign, so it's unclear whether the party still supports it. Plaid Cymru, meanwhile, has no specific policies on alternative medicine. Simon Singh: Libel What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Plaid Cymru has joined the cross-party consensus on the need to change libel laws. The Libel Reform campaign is focused on laws that apply in England and Wales, and so the question is less relevant to the SNP. Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? Both Plaid Cymru and the SNP are passionate advocates of action against climate change, and both adopt a range of very similar policies in this area, rejecting the need for nuclear power stations in their countries, preferring to draw on their natural resources to develop renewable energy supplies. Plaid Cymru's objection to nuclear appears slightly more ideological, whereas the SNP points to a lack of any need for it for the relatively small Scottish population. Both parties put a lot of faith in the potential of a green revolution to create jobs, with the SNP aiming for 60,000 new jobs, and Plaid Cymru planning a massive expansion of the renewable energy industry. The differences lie in the details, with the Scottish exploring the possibility of becoming a world-leading carbon importer, and the Welsh seeking to construct local, sustainable communities self-reliant in energy where possible. How feasible these plans are given the investment available is unclear, and it's interesting that the SNP's policies seem more centralised than the local initiatives outlined by Plaid Cymru. But clearly both parties have a very passionate commitment to this area. David Nutt: Drug policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? \"We believe drug policy should be entirely based on scientific evidence.\" It's a bold and welcome statement. Plaid Cymru also clearly sees drug harm as a public health issue rather than a criminal problem, with the party's policies focusing on rehabilitation and education. Its call for \"a public debate over drugs laws\" is admirable, but given the poor state of media reporting on the issue it would probably backfire. Notably, Plaid is the first party responding to these questions to explicitly state that it would decriminalise a drug – cannabis. The SNP adopts a similar public health focus, with an emphasis on treatment and rehabilitation. However, the rhetoric on its website still falls into the trap of suggesting that drug use is automatically a problem. Other parties The BNP bravely joins Ukip in the fight against the fight against climate change, although it does still take environmental protection and green belts seriously. There appears to be a lack of understanding when it comes to climate change, which the party believes to be a theory \"which holds that all western nations need to be stripped of their manufacturing base and pay untold billions to the Third World to build up their industries\". Its ideal of libel reform also bucks the trend, with plans to introduce laws which \"will hold journalists and their media outlets criminally liable for knowingly publishing falsehoods\". From the desk of the party's sci-fi spokesman we have uncosted proposals for a 200mph intercity maglev network. Under the BNP, soil would be \"reinvigorated\", GM produce would be banned, and the family farm would become the basic unit of British agriculture. If you want to keep reading the 84 pages I couldn't be bothered to look at, be my guest. The Christian Party has an innovative approach to policy-making that can be summed up as \"what does the Bible say?\" This is taken to such extremes that all taxes – VAT, income tax, corporation tax, and so on – would be set at 20%, apparently because this is what the pharaohs of Egypt were told to set their taxes at in Genesis. Abortion is obviously a big fat no, while the party adopts a zero-tolerance policy on drug abuse (though not, presumably, on the drug that is in Communion wine). Having teased the Jeremy Clarkson vote with promises of raising the speed limit to 90mph, the Christian Party brushes it aside with a surprising focus on the environment. In terms of education, under the Christian Party children would be taught chastity until marriage, and creationism would be restored to its rightful place in the national curriculum. If that all sounds good to you, then you're probably reading the wrong column. Shoo! Conclusions The less said about the BNP and the Christian Party, the better. One MP from either party would be one too many, and many of their policies fall foul of Poe's Law – so absurd as to be indistinguishable from parody. For Plaid Cymru and the SNP the results are mixed, as you would expect from smaller parties. It's hard not to admire both for their commitment to environmental issues, an area in which they provide glimpses of the sort of thinking that English greens might achieve if they were more willing to engage with real science. That said, while their plans are ambitious, it's difficult to assess how feasible they might be. Both parties take a very practical view of science funding, placing it at the heart of their economic plans, something on which your mileage may vary. Where the regional parties falter is in fringe areas – neither party seems particularly strong on alternative medicine, and little thought has been given to areas like stem cell research or GM crops. Plaid Cymru has an excellent policy on drugs, while the SNP doesn't seem to go far enough, and doesn't appear to quite grasp the root causes of the problems it wants to tackle. In summary, while I wouldn't rush out to cast my vote for these parties on the basis of their science policies, I don't see many problems here either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/17/severn-barrage-plan-sunk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-17T15:44:07Z","webTitle":"Severn barrage plan likely to be sunk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/17/severn-barrage-plan-sunk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/17/severn-barrage-plan-sunk","fields":{"headline":"Severn barrage plan likely to be sunk","bodyText":"Plans for the world's biggest tidal energy project, spanning the Severn estuary between Somerset and Wales, are likely to be dashed tomorrow when the government announces its refusal to back the controversial £21bn project with public finance. The 10-mile-long scheme, which the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) believes could provide 8.6GW of renewable electricity - equivalent to 5% of the UK's needs and two or three nuclear power stations - has long proved controversial. Engineers first proposed plans for a barrage across the Severn in the 1930s. The scheme has divided environmentalists, some of whom say it would destroy an internationally important marsh and mudflat habitat, increase local flooding and reduce fish stocks. The department will publish its decision on whether or not to back the project tomorrow morning, but sources close to the process have told the Guardian they cannot conceive of the government backing it with public finance at a time when it is focused on cutting the budget deficit. The department's own documents state that the Cardiff-Weston barrage could not be built without government funding. The financing and ownership options report, published in December 2008, says: \"A larger scheme would not be constructed without public sector intervention [because] the private sector would not have the capacity to finance or build the scheme without government support.\" Jonathon Porritt oversaw a 2007 report that backed the giant barrage while he was chair of the government advisory body, the Sustainable Development Commission, which was itself abolished last week. Last night he said: \"If the government is not prepared to find any mechanism to put public funds into the pot, it will die.. \"It's a good way to generate a lot of clean energy,\" he said. \"If it is a choice between a [large] barrage on the Severn and two nuclear power stations, then it is clear to me which is better - it is the barrage.\" Last month, the Observer revealed the large barrage was unlikely to go ahead and that ministers were expected to recommend that further feasibility studies be carried out on one of four much smaller projects, which would cost about £3bn and have a capacity between 0.6GW and 1.4GW. But ministers are not expected to give any guarantee that the selected option will go ahead. \"It will make pretty depressing reading,\" according to a source who had seen the report. The four smaller options include two shorter barrages further upstream from the Cardiff-Weston barrage, and two lagoon proposals, which capture water in an artificial lake and do not block the entire estuary. • Shoots barrage: would generate about 1GW, equivalent to a large fossil fuel plant. • Beachley barrage: further upstream again, just above the Wye river, would generate about 0.6GW. • Bridgewater Bay lagoon: would impound a section of the estuary on the coast between east of Hinkley Point and Weston-super-Mare, would generate 1.36GW. • Fleming lagoon: a similar scheme which would generate the same power from a section of the Welsh shore between Newport and the Severn road crossings. Roger Hull, spokesman for the Severn Tidal Power Group, a consortium of engineering and construction companies that has supported plans for Severn tidal projects for over 20 years, said that even these smaller-scale projects would require considerable government funding. \"The renewable energy available from the tides in the Severn estuary are enormous and we as a nation should be making use of them,\" he said. The government is committed to generating 20% of the UK's energy from renewable sources by 2020 in order to cut the nation's greenhouse gas emissions and limit the impact of climate change. Days after becoming prime minister, David Cameron said he wanted his government to be the \"greenest ever\"; ruling out the largest Severn barrage would mean that more of the other low-carbon sources of energy, such as wind, solar and nuclear, will have to be developed. Nik Shelton, of the RSPB, which opposes the Cardiff-Weston barrage, said: \"We want the Cardiff-Weston barrage turned down for ecological reasons, not economic ones, as the latter leaves the door open for this destructive scheme to be resurrected at a later date.\" Steph Merry, head of marine renewables at the Renewable Energy Association, said last year that only the giant barrage made sense. \"You need something that is a large-scale project on the same scale as a power station in order to meet the renewables targets. The Severn barrage, or something similar, is the only way of achieving that. It's much bigger than any other marine renewable or solar or wind.\" The 2007 SDC report controversially suggested the wetlands lost under a Cardiff-Weston barrage could be compensated for by the sacrifice of low-grade farmland in East Anglia, Wales and elsewhere, which was already proving impractical to defend against sea level rises. It also argued the large barrage could provide a much-needed additional river crossing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/sep/21/lib-dems-chris-huhne","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-21T15:20:22Z","webTitle":"Lib Dems will not be reassured by Chris Huhne's speech | James Randerson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/21/lib-dems-chris-huhne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/sep/21/lib-dems-chris-huhne","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dems will not be reassured by Chris Huhne's speech","bodyText":"In the early days of the coalition there was a fair amount of cautious goodwill from environmentalists. The coalition agreement appeared to include some of the best of both the Tory and Lib Dem environmental policies, and having the greenest mainstream party (the Lib Dems) at the heart of government could only be a good thing, many reasoned. When Chris Huhne landed the top job in the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the green mood only improved. And David Cameron courted green opinion by promising to be the \"greenest government ever\". That phrase, which Huhne repeated in his speech to the Lib Dem conference in Liverpool today, may come back to haunt them both as the department struggles to make sharp cuts and deliver what Huhne described as the \"third industrial revolution\" — the low-carbon economy. Already, the government has rowed back on promises to clamp down on the illegal timber trade and on extending green electricity subsidies to early adopters of small-scale solar generation. They have also decided to shut down the totemic Sustainable Development Commission in the first round of cuts this year. So many activists will have been listening to Huhne's speech – like Clegg's yesterday – wanting to be reassured that the party's principles are not being swallowed up by the Tory beast and the Treasury's ravenous appetite for cuts. Will they have been reassured? Huhne's big pitch was that the government is serious about climate change and low-carbon energy. He trumpeted the \"green deal\" to refit 26m homes around the UK as \"the first scheme of its kind in the developed world, the most ambitious energy-saving plan every put forward\", later saying that it posed \"the greatest challenge across Whitehall in peacetime\". The plan would create 250,000 jobs, he said, and mean that Britain will no longer be using more energy to heat its houses than Sweden – which is 7 degrees colder in January. \"[At present] we might as well be standing outside burning £50 notes,\" he added. This was a hard-headed, pragmatic speech which will not have gone down well with the more idealistic and hair-shirted fringe of green opinion. But what Huhne had to say on nuclear power may have been too pragmatic even for his own party, which has grave doubts about the technology. Huhne himself has previously argued that \"outdated\" nuclear power is not needed to meet the UK's climate targets. \"Nuclear is a tried, tested and failed technology,\" he said in November 2007. The coalition document itself included the phrase, \"Liberal Democrats have long opposed any new nuclear construction.\" Today's message was rather different. \"There is an important place for new nuclear stations in our energy mix as long as there is no public subsidy ... I'm fed up with the stand-off between renewable and nuclear which means we have neither – we will have both. We will have low-carbon energy, and security of supply.\" Many Lib Dem supporters will feel misled by this significant softening of his stance on nuclear. There were some new announcements in the speech – a government-wide plan for carbon cuts (no detail), more oversight from the Department of Energy and Climate Change of energy price transparency – but both were pretty small beer. There was also a promise (heard many times from governments past) to do better on rolling out renewable energy. The real proof though – as with the whole low-carbon agenda – will be in the delivery. His final pitch was to those party members worried that the Lib Dems would lose their identity while in government. \"We've been crying in the wilderness for far too long,\" he said. At the next election the coalition will not be on the ballot paper so \"we must show – and tell and convince – the country why we, the Liberal Democrats, not the coalition deserve more votes, more seats, and above all more power.\" The Lib Dems' emphasis on green policies in opposition means that Huhne's achievements or otherwise will be key to how that judgment is made."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/audio/2010/sep/28/facebook-film-social-network-acs-law","type":"audio","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-28T17:41:03Z","webTitle":"Tech Weekly podcast: The Social Network - our verdict on the Facebook film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/audio/2010/sep/28/facebook-film-social-network-acs-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/audio/2010/sep/28/facebook-film-social-network-acs-law","fields":{"headline":"Tech Weekly: The Social Network - our verdict on the Facebook film","bodyText":"Join Aleks Krotoski, Jemima Kiss, Gia Milinovich and Charles Arthur for the latest technology news.

The move has triggered a swath of applications around the country from big corporations trying to cash in on this potential new business, but infuriated local councils and campaign groups. The issue of waste is critical to the government as the stockpile is potentially much greater than previously thought and ministers are keen to encourage the power industry to build a new generation of reactors. Actions being considered by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and its Nuclear Decommissioning Authority include: • Allowing the nuclear industry to use ordinary landfill sites for disposing of radioactive waste in a more extensive way. • Allowing the main independent nuclear waste dump at Drigg in Cumbria to reduce its costs by scaling back the level of containment. • Building a £1.5bn radioactive liquid-waste processing plant at Sellafield, Britain's biggest atomic site, despite a history of project cost overruns and wider safety concerns there. • Extending a blueprint for dealing with existing high-level waste to cover that created by future nuclear stations – an \"unjustifiable\" step, according to the chair of the committee that created the blueprint. Cumbria county council, regarded as the most pro-nuclear authority in the country, is among those trying to stop at least two landfill sites from being used for dumping radioactive waste. The council's frustration threatens to undermine the government's attempts to persuade it to host the country's first high-level radioactive waste repository. Tim Knowles, cabinet member for the environment on the council, said: \"A tiny amount of nuclear waste went into the Lillyhall landfill site in the past but now they are trying to vastly expand that and use a former open-cast mine at Keekle Head. \"We are talking about moving from a few tons to hundreds of thousands of tons,\" he said. The cost of dealing with existing waste has risen to £73bn and been made worse by the discovery that there is 13m cubic metres of \"potentially contaminated land\" around sites such as Sellafield. This is as well as the existing 3.2m cubic metres of low-level waste and a smaller amount of more radioactive, high-level waste. A report seen by the Guardian, dated October 2008, from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), says: \"In a worst-case scenario, this supplementary volume could increase the volume of land as waste to the point that it dwarfs the current baseline for UK low-level waste. This uncertainty presents significant challenges to the development of a national low-level waste strategy.\" The NDA recently completed a 14-week consultation on low-level waste and said it was close to finalising a new strategy. Extending landfill is clearly part of that. Martin Forwood, of Cumbrians Opposed to a Nuclear Environment, said he was \"appalled\" by moves to spread the waste around the county. \"This is all being done because the Treasury wants to cut the cost, while the one proper licensed waste site at Drigg is almost full up. People seem willing to bend over backwards to help nuclear in a way they don't for anyone else.\" Waste management firms have moved swiftly to apply for permission to dispose of nuclear material. A French-owned company, Sita (through its Endecom subsidiary), is applying to the Environment Agency for authorisation for a Radioactive Substances Act disposal unit for its Clifton Marsh landfill site near Preston. Sita has also presented local councillors and industry professionals with plans to convert a former open-cast mine at Keekle Head, near Whitehaven, Cumbria. A rival waste company, Augean, is trying to convince locals it should be allowed to dump nuclear waste at the East Northants Management Facility at Kings Cliffe village, near Peterborough. And EnergySolutions, a firm with deep roots in the nuclear industry, wants to extend the use of a landfill site at Lillyhall in Cumbria. Rob Scott, from Sita's nuclear consultants, Nuvia, said: \"Planned decommissioning of nuclear installations will generate significant quantities of low-level waste and very low-level waste, such as building rubble and soil. \"It is now clear that the continued disposal of this low-level waste to the highly engineered national Low-Level Waste Repository, near Drigg in west Cumbria, is not sustainable and is very expensive for the taxpayer. This means alternative solutions have to be found.\" The energy department said last night it expected a decision on low-level waste from the NDA within \"months\" but said this would not affect the timing of its wider nuclear programme. It said a policy dating back to 2007 allowed landfill to be used for the disposal of very low-level waste \"subject to appropriate regulatory authorisations\" though it is unclear if any waste has been disposed of in this way. But Melanie McCall, one of the campaigners opposing the Augean move near Peterborough, said: \"People don't want to be guinea pigs. The dump is completely inappropriate for this waste.\" Augean said it was satisfied there would be no \"harm to our employees, the public or the environment\". Low-level waste is made up of a wide range of materials used in the atomic industry, including plastic and clothing as well as metal and building rubble. It makes up approximately 90% of the total volume of the UK's radioactive waste but, the NDA argues, it contains \"less than 0.0003%\" of the total radioactivity. The government expects high-level waste to be buried in a deep repository and two local councils in Cumbria have made \"expressions of interest\" about housing the dump, although discussions remain at a very early stage. The waste from future reactors will be lower in volume but highly radioactive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/aug/20/ahmadinejad-iran-uranium-enriching","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-20T18:23:11Z","webTitle":"Ahmadinejad: give Iran uranium supplies and we'll stop enriching","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/20/ahmadinejad-iran-uranium-enriching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/aug/20/ahmadinejad-iran-uranium-enriching","fields":{"headline":"Ahmadinejad: give Iran uranium supplies and we'll stop enriching","bodyText":"Iran would stop enriching uranium to a high grade if it was assured of the supplies it needed for a research reactor, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on the eve of the inauguration of the country's first nuclear power plant. His remarks came as the US reportedly told Israel it believes Iran is still a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon – probably lessening the chances of a pre-emptive military strike that could ignite war across the Middle East. Ahmadinejad's comments to a Japanese newspaper appeared designed to deflect international pressure over Iran's nuclear programme. \"We promise to stop enriching uranium to 20% purity if we are ensured fuel supply,\" he was quoted as saying by the Yomiuri Shimbun. But he rejected calls by the UN security council for Iran to halt all enrichment, not just to the higher level required to build weapons. \"We have a right to enrich uranium,\" he said. \"We have never initiated war or wanted nuclear bombs.\" Earlier this week Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that his country would not engage in nuclear talks with the US unless sanctions were lifted and military threats ended. Israel, an undeclared atomic power which has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), has often warned that it cannot live with a nuclear-armed Iran and hinted it may attack it, as it did Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. The US has forcefully backed tougher sanctions and there have been signs that Iran has experienced technical problems with its nuclear programme, either because of the difficulties in obtaining parts or as a result of deliberate sabotage. The New York Times quoted Israeli officials as saying that their assessments were coming into line with the US view, but they remain suspicious that Iran has a secret enrichment site yet to be discovered. Fierce debate has been raging in the US media about this in recent weeks. US officials told the paper they believed the mounting cost of sanctions – especially those affecting Iran's ability to import petrol and develop its oil fields – had created fissures with the country's political elite and has forced a debate about the costs of developing nuclear weapons. British officials also point to divisions in Tehran about the risks of proceeding. \"The argument is over how far to push the programme, how close to a weapon they can get without paying an even higher price,\" said a senior US official. This year Iran has added only a few centrifuges, the machines that spin uranium at supersonic speed to enrich it, to its main plant at Natanz. Only about half of those installed are operating, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog. So far Iran has produced enough, with considerable additional enrichment, for about two nuclear weapons. Iran will mark a significant advance today when it inaugurates the Bushehr nuclear power station on the Gulf coast. The plant poses little proliferation risk since Russia is supplying the enriched uranium for the reactor and will take away spent fuel that could be used to make weapons-grade plutonium. The US, Britain and other western countries all insist Iran has the right to generate nuclear energy under the NPT and hope to use that to coax it away from any non-peaceful work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/21/ofgem-energy-firms-gas-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-21T20:40:26Z","webTitle":"Ofgem tells energy firms: 'one last chance'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/21/ofgem-energy-firms-gas-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/21/ofgem-energy-firms-gas-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Ofgem tells energy firms: 'one last chance'","bodyText":"Energy companies have been given \"one last chance\" to stop customers from being ripped off or face a full-scale Competition Commission inquiry. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it had found evidence that the 'big six' suppliers – EDF, British Gas, E.ON, RWE npower, Scottish and Southern and Scottish Power – increase customers' bills more quickly when wholesale energy costs go up than they cut them when costs fall. Alistair Buchanan, chief executive of Ofgem, has also ordered the power companies to simplify the bewildering array of 350 different tariffs available. He said there was still not enough competition in the market. He was speaking as Ofgem announced the results of a four-month investigation into the energy market. Buchanan said he was giving the industry just two months to fall into line before deciding whether to recommend a full-scale two-year competition investigation. He said the companies would be \"on the canvas\" after Ofgem had delivered a \"left hook\" with its new set of demands. But industry executives said they thought the likelihood of a full investigation was now remote and dismissed his comments as rhetoric. The main new demand is for energy companies to auction on the open market about 15% of the power they generate, to make it easier for small independent suppliers to compete. The big six enjoy a virtual monopoly as they are all vertically integrated – they have their own power stations to supply their customers. Small suppliers struggle to purchase electricity on the open market. However, at least two of the big six have already proposed making these changes. Energy experts said the changes would not radically boost competition because only companies with large balance sheets can take the risk of energy prices slumping. Ofgem also said it would require companies to reduce the complexity of tariffs on offer which make it hard for customers to compare prices and switch supplier. The number of tariffs for customers to choose from has increased by more than 70% since 2008 to almost 350. More deals are likely in the future under the government's Green Deal energy efficiency programme. Under Ofgem's proposals, companies will only be able to offer a single tariff for each payment method for customers who are not bound by fixed contracts. Ofgem has also proposed making clearer the requirements it introduced after its last market investigation in 2008 to increase transparency. Since then, companies have had to publish a breakdown of their energy costs and their retail margins every year – but they use different accounting methods. They also have to provide annual energy statements to customers showing how much electricity and gas they use, although many consumers find them confusing. The regulator also launched an investigation into Scottish Power and why dual fuel customers paying by cheque are charged much more than those on direct debit. Ofgem's investigation is the 18th inquiry into the energy market by politicians and regulators. With energy companies increasing bills last winter to near-record highs, Ofgem came under pressure again to investigate whether companies were making excessive profits. The industry has been lobbying politicians and the media, warning that if there were a Competition Commission referral, they would delay spending billions of pounds on nuclear power and wind farms until the outcome was clear. Energy minister Charles Hendry appeared to back the industry last month when he said the big six could be scared off from investing in the UK. The government is also considering whether to withdraw the regulator's consumer powers. It will announce its decision within weeks of the conclusion of the two-month deadline. Buchanan denied he had come under political pressure but admitted there was \"creative tension\" between the government and the regulator: \"The government will have its views on certain things. But we will have our own view and will express it.\" Dieter Helm, an economist specialising in energy regulation and a former government adviser, criticised the Ofgem demands as little more than a \"sticking plaster\". He said: \"I would have thought there was a prima facie case for investigation. They should say 'fair enough let's bring in a third party'. A more substantial investigation would be sensible and clear the air. This continuous set of interventions is hardly helpful from a company point of view.\" He claimed Ofgem wanted to avoid a Competition Commission referral because it would examine the regulator's role in setting up the current system. \"It looks like they were desperate to avoid going to the Competition Commission. It's more sticking plaster.

Indeed, mention the word \"Icesave\" to Icelanders, and most want to run for cover. Which is why the matter of the \"golden geese\" last week provided something of a welcome respite. The story took most everyone by surprise. Ten mega-rich investors from the US and Canada had contacted Icelandic authorities and were pledging to invest up to $15bn into our cash-strapped economy. All they wanted was a teeny-weeny favour in return: Icelandic citizenship for themselves and their children. To the glib observer, the deal certainly sounded attractive. The tycoons' Canadian attorney, one David Lesperance, gushed to Iceland's national public-service broadcaster RÚV that the group had been so taken with the country that they wanted to \"join team Iceland\". They were, he said, \"motivated beyond money\" and were primarily looking to invest in the country for political and philanthropic reasons. When the reporter sounded doubtful, he quickly added that they were also concerned about the number of nuclear power plants being built where they lived, and about their children being drafted into the military. Neither of which would happen if they lived in Iceland. Icelandic citizenship, like citizenship in most countries, is usually not up for sale. Potential candidates have had to fulfil stringent requirements, including having lived in the country for a number of years. Currently there are two high-profile cases pending, involving women who have had applications for residency in Iceland denied. Both have widespread support among the general public and are currently awaiting the outcome of an appeal. That the head of the Icelandic parliament's general committee seemed to support the tycoons' application – or at least not to outright reject it – has caused massive indignation. In conversation with RÚV he said that it should at least be given due consideration, stated (wrongly) that other countries, such as Canada and Australia, offered citizenship to solvent, wealthy investors, and reminded viewers that Icelandic citizenship had been granted under exceptional circumstances in the past – most famously in the case of former chess champion Bobby Fischer. The outrage within Iceland was immediate. Blogs and social media sites seethed with disapproval. The general sentiment was that we'd been sold down the river before … we were duped by the bankers and \"Viking raiders\", and have recently seen a large swath of land, rich in geothermal energy, taken over by a Canadian company – a deal that has been met with vehement opposition, most notably from Icelandic singer Björk. We would not be duped again. And anyway, why the emphasis on citizenship? If these people simply wanted to \"join team Iceland\", they were free to invest in most sectors. No one was rejecting their money. Mind you, they could not legally gain access to Icelandic resources (although the aforementioned Canadian deal proved that with a few hat tricks even that was possible) – and anyway, their attorney emphasised that this was by no means their intention. Some light was soon shed on that particular matter with the discovery of a website run by Lesperance, entitled Flight of the Golden Geese – a bizarre conception that at first looks as if it was made for Old MacDonald and his farm. Prominently displayed on the page is a helpful video that can only be interpreted as propaganda for tax exile, and which in a mildly creepy fashion seems designed for a child. In another location on the site, we came rather more directly to the point: \"David Lesperance specializes in providing tax-efficient global multi-jurisdiction residence/citizenship and domicile solutions which enable his clients to maintain or improve their current personal and business lifestyles.\" A-ha. Could it be that the golden geese are flying away from US authorities, who are currently cracking down on citizens with offshore bank accounts? Those citizens will face hefty fines unless they come forward and declare their accounts. Something that could likely be avoided with new citizenship. I find it highly unlikely that the 10 golden geese represented by Lesperance will be successful in their bid for instant citizenship in the Land of Fire and Ice. However, the whole affair has highlighted a number of issues that it is no doubt healthy for citizens of all nations to consider. Issues such as: how valuable is citizenship and national identity? How ethical is it for economically vulnerable countries to \"sell\" citizenship in return for a financial injection into their economy? And are the golden eggs laid by golden geese really made of gold – or only fool's gold? And once the Icesave dispute has been settled – one way or the other – the Icelanders may just have some time to devote to such questions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2011/apr/28/alternative-vote-referendum-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-27T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Letter: Our only chance to achieve fairer votes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/28/alternative-vote-referendum-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/apr/28/alternative-vote-referendum-environment","fields":{"headline":"Our only chance to achieve fairer votes","bodyText":"One week today we will be asked if we want to move to a fairer voting system or stick with the status quo (Comment, 27 April). Our current rules for electing MPs to parliament were designed for a different age, when 95% of us voted for the two main parties; at the last election this fell to 65%. Man-made climate change, nuclear power and food waste are environmental problems which don't break down into the age-old two-party structure. They cut across ideology and partisan interests and can slip through the cracks when the big parties fixate on the preoccupations of the floating voters in marginal seats who currently decide elections. The alternative vote will allow voters to rank candidates and mean MPs need the support of 50% of their constituents to get elected, a test currently met only by one in three members of parliament. MPs will have to reach further and speak to people who are not their natural supporters, opening the door to environmentalists to put their concerns on the map. The Australian Greens have benefitted from the alternative vote, as voters can support them without fear of letting an unpopular candidate in. But this is bigger than the interests of any one party. The alternative vote makes it easier for independent-minded people, inside and outside political parties, to be vocal about the environment and for single-issue parties to spring up in support of change. If our voting system cannot cope with the most pressing challenge of our times then it must be reformed and 5 May is our one and only chance to do so. • Regarding the letter above, which appeared in the paper of 28 April, a version of the following item was due for publication on 29 April 2011 in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column: A 50-signature letter was submitted for publication by the campaign group Yes to Fairer Votes.

The figures came as emergency workers were evacuated from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after smoke or steam was seen rising from one of its reactor units. The smoke raised concerns that water in the spent fuel pools at the No 3 unit was running low, but officials said there was no immediate spike in radiation levels. \"We are checking the cause of the smoke,\" Hidehiko Nishiyama, a nuclear safety agency official, told reporters. Earlier, engineers finally succeeded in connecting power cables to three of the plant's reactors and said they planned to test the pumps soon. Engineers hope to connect those power supplies to the No 3 and No 4 units on Tuesday, the public broadcaster NHK said. The nuclear emergency is far from over, however. On Monday, it was reported that the No 3 reactor had experienced a surge in pressure that may require workers to vent radioactive steam, a tactic that set off hydrogen gas explosions at the facility last week. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, conceded that the buildup of pressure was unsettling. \"We knew that even if things went smoothly, there would be twists and turns,\" he told reporters. \"At the moment, we are not so optimistic that there will be a breakthrough.\" That is causing concern because the reactor is the only one of the six that contains plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel – or MOX – and would release highly toxic plutonium in the event of a meltdown. The fuel in the other reactors is uranium. The country's self-defence forces resumed work on Monday to cool down the No 4 and No 3 reactors with seawater. Japan's nuclear safety agency said it did not believe much water from the two reactors had seeped underground. Radiation leaks from stricken reactors continued to spread through the region's food supply, though at levels too low to endanger health. The agency acknowledged that workers at the site risked inhaling radioactive dust, but said it had so far found no evidence of that happening. Radiation in excess of government standards was found in canola and chrysanthemum greens grown in the Fukushima area, a day after authorities reported that milk and spinach had been contaminated, as well as tap water in Tokyo, 150 miles away. The health ministry advised 6,000 villagers in Iitate, 19 miles from the power plant, not to drink tap water after tests revealed it contained abnormal, though not harmful, amounts of iodine-131, a radioactive substance. \"We think we have arrived at the point where we are very close to getting the situation under control,\" the deputy cabinet secretary, Tetsuro Fukuyama, said. Graham Andrew, a senior official of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said: \"There have been some positive developments in the last 24 hours but overall the situation remains very serious.\" The US energy secretary, Steven Chu, told CNN that he believed the worst of the nuclear crisis was over, but added: \"I don't want to make a blanket statement.\" Attention is turning to the humanitarian crisis on Japan's north-east coast and the cost of the cleanup and reconstruction operations. The World Bank said that it could take Japan five years, and cost between £75bn and £145bn – equivalent to 4% of Japan's GDP – to overcome the catastrophe, while private insurers face a combined bill of up to $33bn. \"Damage to housing and infrastructure has been unprecedented,\" the bank said. \"Growth should pick up though in subsequent quarters as reconstruction efforts, which could last five years, accelerate.\" The bank said damage from the tsunami could also affect trade in the region. The price of some Japanese-made memory chips have risen 20% because of disruption to production lines, while car plants in Asia face shortages of auto parts. \"Disruption to production networks, especially in automotive and electronics industries, could continue to pose problems,\" the World Bank said. \"Japan is a major producer of parts, components and capital goods which supply east Asia's production chains.\" While hundreds of workers battle to render the nuclear plant safe, Japan continues to count its dead. Police estimates show more than about 18,400 died – 10,500 in Miyagi prefecture alone. A further 452,000 people are living in shelters. \"It is very distressing as we recover more bodies day after day,\" said police spokesman Hitoshi Sugawara."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2010/nov/02/channel-4-green-documentary","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-02T15:50:13Z","webTitle":"Channel 4 accused of misleading contributors to green documentary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/02/channel-4-green-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2010/nov/02/channel-4-green-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Channel 4 accused of misleading contributors to green documentary","bodyText":"An environmental documentary due to be broadcast on Channel 4 on Thursday evening has come under attack from a leading American environmentalist who was interviewed for the programme, as well as a coalition of anti-GM campaigners based in the developing world. Adam Werbach, a California-based sustainability consultant and former president of the Sierra Club conservation group, told the Guardian that the makers of What the Green Movement Got Wrong did not inform him about the programme's polemical nature when they first approached him to contribute. He says that the final version, which he has seen, does not accurately represent his opinions and that he wants his contribution edited out of the programme. He is now considering making a formal complaint to Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, once the programme has aired. Greenpeace said it also had \"major issues\" with how the film was explained to potential contributors and considered it was \"lied to\" about the film's focus when asked by the film-makers to provide archive footage of environmental protests from the 1960s. Channel 4 and the production company, Darlow Smithson, denied they had misled contributors. The documentary is described by Channel 4 as a film in which \"life-long diehard greens advocate radical solutions to climate change, which include GM crops and nuclear energy\". Contributors such as Mark Lynas, author of Six Degrees, and Stewart Brand, author of The Whole Earth Catalog, are, say the channel, now part of a \"a group of environmentalists across the world [who] believe that, in order to save the planet, humanity must embrace the very science and technology they once so stridently opposed … They argue that by clinging to an ideology formed more than 40 years ago, the traditional green lobby has failed in its aims and is ultimately harming its own environmental cause.\" The 75-minute documentary will be followed by a live studio debate chaired by news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy and will feature \"leading policy makers, commentators, scientists, entrepreneurs and economists\". Guardian columnist George Monbiot is scheduled to be among the 12 panellists taking part in the debate. In a letter sent today to Channel 4's head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, a coalition of anti-GM campaigners based in the developing world led by India's Vandana Shiva accused the filmmakers of using only two \"southern-based commentators\", both of whom are \"funded by major GMO [genetically modified organisms] companies\". The letter states: \"We are tired of the corporate campaigns which claim to speak for the global south and allege that western-based non-governmental organisations are imposing their beliefs about genetically modified food on our countries.\" Adam Werbach said the film \"misrepresents who is to blame for many of our social and environmental problems\". He added: \"Blaming environmentalists for starvation and lack of energy [in developing nations] is like blaming weathermen for the weather.\" More specifically, Werbach said Darlow Smithson did not \"accurately share with me the editorial basis of the documentary when they asked me to contribute\". \"They told me they were doing a documentary about the ideas of Stewart Brand, who is a friend of mine, and looking at other inspiring ideas and new ways to protect the planet,\" he said. \"They didn't tell me that it was basically about nuclear reactors and genetically modified foods. They first referred to the film as the 'Stewart Brand documentary' and then they called it the 'New Environmentalists'.\"He added: \"I don't feel the film accurately represents my opinions, which leaves me uncomfortable. I'd rather not be part of it. Being critical of the environmental movement is important to make the environmental movement better. But to attack the environmental movement for thousands or millions of deaths in Africa is far beyond anything I believe. I'm upset that I was not told the proper title of this film. I would rather my contribution was edited out of the programme.\" Werbach says there are \"four or five, one or two-sentence quotes\" from him in the final film, but that such editing has decontextualised his views: \"For example, a lot of what I was talking about was the American environmental movement and in the interviews I had made it very clear that I was talking about the US but that things are different globally. But that was never made clear in the film.\" \"Nuclear power and GM foods are portrayed as the hallmark issues of 'New Environmentalists'. But these have never been issues for me. The opening and closing packages of the film start with a description of these New Environmentalists who believe that the environmental movement has done damage by blocking GM foods and nuclear power. But it would be a real strain to look at my interview and believe that was my opinion..\" Werbach said he now intends to study section seven of Ofcom's broadcast code to see whether he has grounds for an official complaint. The section covers \"fairness\" and, in particular, when a \"person is invited to make a contribution to a programme\". Section 7.3 states that a contributor \"should normally, at an appropriate stage, be told the nature and purpose of the programme, what the programme is about and be given a clear explanation of why they were asked to contribute\". In 2008, Ofcom ruled that Channel 4 had been in breach of section seven of the code when it aired the highly controversial film The Great Global Warming Swindle during the previous year. In particular, Ofcom upheld a complaint made by Prof Carl Wunsch, an oceanographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that the programme-makers had failed to properly inform him that the programme was polemic. Doug Parr, Greenpeace's chief scientist, said: \"Like the film itself, the email we were sent by the producers was almost comically misleading. You would have thought Channel 4 would have learned its lesson after the previous controversies, but judging from this latest attempt to set us up, they haven't. \"We've now seen the documentary. It's a slick, expensive piece of film-making, but gets basic stuff flat-out wrong and misrepresents the green movement from start to finish, such as claiming that we told Zambia to reject GM food aid when in reality we recommended that they accept it if that was the only option. After Against Nature [a 1997 documentary about environmentalism that was found by the Independent Television Commission to have misled interviewees about \"the content and purpose of the programmes\" and to have distorted their views \"through selective editing\"] and the Great Global Warming Swindle it's a case of 'here we go again'\" A Channel 4 spokesperson said: \"The green movement is not united by one orthodoxy – this is demonstrated by the range of views within the film. All the contributors were briefed extensively on the overarching narrative of the film, which is led by the views of our main interviewees, Stewart Brand and Mark Lynas.\" The spokesperson rejected the idea that Werbach had been deliberately misled over the nature of the film and said that the clips of his interview accurately represented his opinions. \"The correspondence with Adam Werbach clearly and accurately describes the basis for the film as the eco-pragmatist thesis of environmentalist Stewart Brand.\" She said that he had signed a contributor release for which described the film as examining \"recent revisionist trends in thinking about some key environmental issues including climate change, nuclear power, genetically modified food and pollution.\" She said Channel 4 refuted Greenpeace's accusations of inaccuracy. \"Their responses are represented fairly and accurately in a programme that has been meticulously researched over a six-month period.\" \"Channel 4's coverage of environmental issues should not be characterised by singling out two programmes which aired in 1997 and 2007. In the past two years alone we have broadcast series such as Man on Earth, feature-length films such as The 11th Hour, The End of the Line, The Cove and An Inconvenient Truth as well as numerous Unreported World investigations and True Stories documentaries on environmental issues.\" \"It was made clear that the different titles for the project at the outset were working titles. There was no intention to deceive him, the final title was only chosen and confirmed at the time of billing [two weeks ago].\" Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: \"We're always up for having a debate – but we've seen this documentary, and it is a blatant piece of misinformation based largely on the views of paid lobbyists and journalists with books to sell.\" Mark Lynas said, \"With the eruption of all this controversy before the film has even been screened, I hear the ominous sound of wagons being circled and minds being closed. The green movement needs to learn to deal with criticism constructively rather than just seeing every difficult issue as a conspiracy of evil corporations and profiteering commercial interests.\" \"This is a real debate and the environmental movement needs to tackle it head on rather than asserting that all challengers are part of some imagined evil conspiracy,\" he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/aug/20/obama-administration-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-20T15:23:49Z","webTitle":"Iran's reactor and the US response | Michael Tomasky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/aug/20/obama-administration-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/aug/20/obama-administration-iran","fields":{"headline":"Iran's reactor and the US response","bodyText":"There's been a lot of talk around Washington this week involving Iran, Israel and the new nuclear power facility Iran is about to put on line. According to John Bolton, Israel now has, what, three days left to strike the facility, after which it will be too late. Bolton is also no doubt busy writing his speech for the big 9-11 Stop the Islamization of America rally, which will also feature that man of peace Geert Wilders. At any rate, it seems fairly clear that Israel is not going to bomb Iran this weekend. I think. So Iran will have a nuclear power facility - overseen by Russia, open to international inspections, whatever assurances those two factors provide. I should say here that I don't like the idea of a nuclear Iran (not in the sense of power plants, but in the warhead sense) any more than Bolton does. But what can we do about it? Marc Ambinder of the Atlantic describes the problems well: Meanwhile, what (and who) would the targets of a U.S. strike be? And why should we suppose that Iran -- now seen as irrational and millennialist -- would suddenly become rational and incentive-oriented after an attack? The only thing that might work to stop such a putatively irrational regime is a massive decapitation campaign involving special forces insertions; thousands of missiles; hundreds of U.S. war planes, equipped with next-generation jamming technology; a major campaign to own the airspace; denying Iran the sea (because they'd immediately try to shut down the Gulf); the transfer of thousands of troops from South Korea and Afghanistan -- and more. A few F-22 passes and a B-2 sortie aren't going to do the job. That sounds a lot like full-blown war. And what happens in Afghanistan, and on the Korean peninsula, if thousands of troops are transferred away from there? These are the people who told us Iraq would be a relative cakewalk, and here we are, seven years later, completing a withdrawal of combat forces from Iraq, but still in an extremely precarious situation there, pending the ability of Iraqi political leaders and security forces to maintain the degree of stability they now have with a smaller US presence. And now they, or some of them, want to start another war, with a country far more powerful than Iraq ever was. So what can we do? Ambinder: We tend to forget that there is an option that the administration is no doubt already exploiting -- one that lies about halfway in between a military strike and sanctions: clandestine activity by U.S. and Western intelligence agencies. What can we do overtly? We can buy up all the loose fissile material on the market. We can trick Iran into buying faulty centrifuges. And we can conduct surgical, targeted direct-action strikes against members of the Iranian military and intelligence establishment. (I'd be genuinely surprised if Israel, in particular, weren't already doing this.) One legacy of Iraq: it reminded people that war is hard and ugly and difficult. A memory that should last, one would hope, a good five years or so. If we're lucky, a full generation. Except with the neocons, for whom the legacy is always that more shooting is better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/aug/20/church-scotland-coal-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-20T14:16:46Z","webTitle":"Church of Scotland makes stand against coal power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/20/church-scotland-coal-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/aug/20/church-scotland-coal-power","fields":{"headline":"Church of Scotland makes stand against coal power station","bodyText":"The Church of Scotland claims a new coal-fired power station planned in Ayrshire could seriously jeopardise attempts to combat climate change, despite its claims to use the latest clean-coal technology. The church has joined a coalition of environment groups opposing plans to construct the 1852MW station at Hunterston on the west coast of Scotland, which has seen about 14,000 objections submitted from across the UK and beyond. The Ayrshire Power plan, which would replace the nearby nuclear power station if it goes ahead, is the only active proposal for a coal-fuelled plant in Britain since the UK and Scottish governments legislated to make deep cuts in CO2 emissions of at least 34% by 2020. The firm promises to fit carbon-capture and storage (CCS) technology from the outset to capture about 22% of its emissions, as a pilot project. It promises to capture 90% of its emissions within five years of the technique being proven, and the plan has so far been supported by Alex Salmond, the first minister, and the Scottish TUC. His Scottish National party government opposes nuclear power, and is blocking any attempts to build new plant in Scotland. While agreeing to a 42% cut in CO2 emissions by 2020, it supports the coal industry, pressing for \"clean coal\" technology, and has authorised a sharp increase in opencast coal mining. Public consultation on the Hunterston plans closed today, and in a rare move one of the church's most influential committees, the church and society council, has written formally to oppose the plan with the approval of the church's elected head, moderator the Right Rev John Christie. It has joined forces with the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Christian Aid, the World Development Movement, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF and Friends of the Earth Scotland in objecting. The church council's convenor, Rev Ian Galloway, said: \"The carbon emissions from this proposal could wipe out all the savings achieved by eco-congregations and other community groups across Scotland and jeopardise any attempt to inspire community engagement in climate change.\" Ayrshire Power, which is wholly owned by the Manchester-based airports and property company Peel Holdings after the Danish energy giant Dong pulled out last year, said the protesters were actually undermining efforts to cut carbon emissions by opposing the scheme. Muir Miller, the project director, said: \"The irony is that these groups are opposing, however sincerely, the very technology that can do most to tackle global warming. Since coal will continue to be the dominant global fossil fuel for power generation for the medium to long term, we must find ways to generate low-carbon electricity from it.\" ScottishPower's existing power station, Longannet, is on a short list of power stations around the UK to test retro-fitted CCS (carbon capture and storage) technology on part of its emissions. Both the UK and Scottish governments have pledged to force any new coal-fired station to fit the technology from the start of operations. The development came as climate camp protesters gathered near the Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters in Edinburgh for a weekend of action. Climate activists are threatening a day of disruption and direct action against the bank and Edinburgh festival events sponsored by RBS on Monday. Tomorrow, activists are expected to join a protest march against plans by Scottish Coal to dig 2m tonnes of coal from a 154-hectare open cast site at Airfield Farm in Midlothian, east of Edinburgh and close to former deep mines once operated by British Coal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jan/05/greenest-government-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-05T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"How to judge the 'greenest government ever' | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jan/05/greenest-government-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/jan/05/greenest-government-ever","fields":{"headline":"How to judge the 'greenest government ever'","bodyText":"David Cameron's statement that the coalition would be the \"greenest government ever\" should be a gift for journalists like me, who aim to play a part in holding politicians to account.

How can it be measured? Our green-o-meter below, launched today, is a bit of fun aimed at illuminating a serious issue. I'll need your help - more below - but let's start with what Cameron himself said. The prime minister picked out three issues for special attention: the green economy, climate change and energy security. His argument for action is a straightforward economic one. \"We've got a real opportunity to drive the green economy to have green jobs and make sure we have our share of the industries of the future.\" Next let's take the government's climate change advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. Its chief executive, David Kennedy, was more specific, telling me there were three green challenges on which the government should be judged: vastly improving the UK's woeful energy efficiency, complete reform of the energy industry to allow low-carbon technologies to flourish and (of course) passing the CCC's carbon budgets into law, the latest of which sets a 60% cut in the UK's emissions by 2030. The government is in the process of tackling the first two. Its \"green deal\" to improve the insulation of homes is now before parliament and it is consulting on changes to the UK's free market in electricity. On the third - the carbon budget - I'd be astonished if the government does not accept it. So far, so good? The coalition has largely started off in the right direction on the issues above, but warning lights have flashed about the ambition of the green investment bank and the emissions performance standards that should prevent dirty fossil fuel power stations being built. We'll be watching to see if the government keeps on track. But there's a whole lot more to being green than jobs, energy and emissions. And that's where the government starts to look pretty pale green. While the department for energy and climate change did relatively well when the axe was wielded in the comprehensive spending review, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was savaged. Defra took the biggest cut in Whitehall. The price of that is beginning to emerge: cuts to flood defence spending in the face of rising risk, proposals to sell off the national forests and proposals for DIY badger culls that fly in the face of the science. There is proposed legislation due this spring in a Defra white paper on the natural environment, so we will be watching that closely too. And this is where you come in. How should we judge the coalition on its pledge to be the \"greenest government ever\"? Is action on climate change the most important issue? What about the controversial issues of nuclear power and high-speed rail? Please tell us how you think the coalition's green credentials should be assessed in the comments below."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/oct/20/nuclear-inspectors-energy-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-19T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Shortage of safety inspectors threatens nuclear power plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/20/nuclear-inspectors-energy-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/oct/20/nuclear-inspectors-energy-power","fields":{"headline":"Shortage of safety inspectors threatens nuclear power plans","bodyText":"Britain's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is battling to recruit up to 50 inspectors to cope with its existing workload in the nuclear industry and the vital assessment of the reactors being put forward to meet government plans for a new generation of nuclear power stations. HSE said its nuclear arm had some 160 inspectors but needed another 30 to bring it up to full complement to meet the workload on existing nuclear sites. It also needs a further 20 inspectors for the teams working on the generic design assessments of the next generation of nuclear reactors. A recruitment drive for inspectors is under way but it is facing fierce competition for scarce skills. The main source of staff with the necessary skills is the industry itself or former naval personnel who have worked on Britain's nuclear-powered submarines. Industry sources said people with nuclear skills were being offered signing-on fees or pay rises of up to £20,000 a year to switch employers. Mike Graham, national secretary of the Prospect trade union, warned that the government would have to be more competitive in terms of inspectors' salaries. \"They are basically going to have to breach public-sector pay restraint or else nuclear new build will be threatened,\" he said The government wants to have the first of a new generation of nuclear power stations on line by 2017 as Britain seeks to replace its existing and ageing nuclear fleet as well as several coal-fired stations and there are concerns that the shortage of inspectors could threaten the timetable. A report for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) by the National Metals Technology Centre (Namtec) says there are serious problems to overcome. \"Delays in the completion of the process and the possible knock-on effects of delays in the planning and licensing processes would affect confidence throughout the supply chain,\" says the report by Stephen Court. An HSE spokesman said that while it wanted to recruit more inspectors to assess the new reactor designs, they were needed on a progressive basis. The shortage of inspectors is only one of a series of issues facing the new-build programme. The Namtec report, The Supply Chain for a UK Nuclear New Build Programme, identifies a range of weaknesses in Britain, including the lack of UK-based engineering firms with atomic experience. There are none here that can produce the forgings needed to manufacture reactor pressure vessels, it warns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/17/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-seawater-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-17T14:04:00Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear reactor water-bombing has little effect","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-seawater-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/17/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-seawater-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear reactor water-bombing has little effect","bodyText":"Attempts to cool down a stricken reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan have suffered a further setback with radiation levels rising rather than falling after attempts to douse it with high-pressure hoses. Six fire engines and a police water cannon were sent in on Thursday evening to spray the plant's No 3 reactor. But afterwards radiation emissions rose from 3,700 microsieverts per hour to 4,000 per hour, the Kyodo news agency quoted Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) as saying. An earlier attempt in which military helicopters dropped thousands of litres of water on the plant also appeared to have failed. As part of the desperate new tactics to avert nuclear meltdown, Chinook helicopters targeted the No 3 reactor's spent fuel rod pool, which is overheating and at risk of releasing dangerous radioactive steam. Two helicopters flying at less than 300 feet dumped four loads of water. Footage suggested much of it missed the target. Emergency crews and the military are trying to cool the reactor and replenish a pool containing spent fuel rods. Tepco has been unable to take precise measurements but the pool at No 3 is feared to be almost empty, raising the risk that the rods will overheat and melt, releasing dangerous levels of radiation. Steam believed to have been caused by water boiling in the pool has been seen rising from it since Wednesday. Officials are also worried that the No 4 reactor's spent fuel pool might be running low. '\"The highest priority now is to pour adequate water onto the No 3 and No 4 reactors, especially in their spent fuel pools,'' said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the government's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency who was quoted by the Kyodo agency. Gregory Jackzo, the chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission, has told a congressional hearing in Washington that the storage pool at No 4 was in danger of giving off more radioactive material. Hikaru Kuroda, a Tepco official, said: \"We are afraid that the water level at [the No 4 reactor] is the lowest. Because we cannot get near it, the only way to monitor the situation is visually from far away.\" Tepco said a military helicopter crew had seen some water in the No 4 pool but this could not be confirmed. Hydrogen explosions on Monday and Tuesday blew the roofs off the No 3 and No 4 reactors, removing the last line of defence against radiation leaks. Tepco has said it is attempting to open a temporary power line to the plant so it can pump water directly into the storage pools and reactor cores. Japan's nuclear safety agency has said it hopes the power supply will be partially operational within hours. \"Once we establish the temporary power supply we will be able to pump seawater into the reactors,\" a Tepco spokesman said. \"We believe the operation will help cool down the fuel pools,\" the defence minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, told reporters. Each helicopter can carry 7.5 tonnes of water per load but the pools each hold 2,000 tonnes, an expert has told public broadcaster NHK. \"It will be possible as long as the rods are fully submerged. That means the storage pool would need to be about a third full. But the dousing has to be done repeatedly.\" About 70,000 people have been evacuated from a 12-mile (20km) radius around Fukushima Daiichi. Another 140,000 living outside 12 miles but within 18 miles (30km) have been told to stay indoors. Japan's cabinet spokesman, Yukio Edano, said there was no need to widen the exclusion zone but signs were emerging that other countries were taking a more cautious approach. The worsening situation prompted the US to ask citizens living within 80km to evacuate. ''We are recommending, as a precaution, that American citizens who live within 50 miles of the Fukushima nuclear power plant evacuate the area or to take shelter indoors if safe evacuation is not practical,'' the US embassy said in a statement. The British embassy has since issued similar advice and asked citizens living in Tokyo and northern Japan to consider leaving. Elevated but not hazardous levels of radiation have been detected well outside the Fukushima evacuation zone. In Ibaraki prefecture to the south, officials said radiation levels were about 300 times normal levels by late Wednesday morning. It would take three years of constant exposure to these higher levels to raise a person's risk of cancer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/15/gkn-warns-japan-car-parts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T12:29:43Z","webTitle":"GKN warns on car part sales to Japan, as FTSE loses 2.5%","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/15/gkn-warns-japan-car-parts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/mar/15/gkn-warns-japan-car-parts","fields":{"headline":"GKN warns on car part sales to Japan, as FTSE loses 2.5%","bodyText":"And the repercussions of the Japanese disaster continue, as falls pretty much across the board keep the FTSE 100 deep in negative territory. GKN, the car parts maker, is the latest to comment, warning it may have to cut the number of components it makes because of falling demand from Japanese auto makers. Around 7% of its revenues come from Japan, and of course a number of the country's car companies including Honda and Nissan have closed down plants in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami damage and power blackouts. GKN shares are down 5.9p at 188.3p. Still with cars, distributor Inchcape is down 20.8p at 346p. Nick Bubb at Arden said: We spoke to the company about Japanese car production, given its reliance on Toyota etc…Toyota has three plants in the earthquake zone, but they are largely for domestic/North American supply and there has basically been no direct impact on the export plants that supply Inchcape for their Asian markets. But Toyota has suspended all production until tomorrow for health and safety reviews. The other manufacturer Subaru (big for Inchcape in Australia) has no plants in the earthquake zone. Given six weeks stock cover, Inchcape does not think first quarter trading in Asia will be affected (group sales to be reported on 12 May), but it is too early to tell about the second quarter, given the threat of power cuts because of the loss of so much nuclear power supply. Overall the FTSE 100 is off its worst levels but still down 133.10 points at 5642.14. Miners dominate the fallers of fears of a slowdown in global economic growth as Japan's economy struggles with the disaster. So Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation is down 57p at 847p and Fresnillo is off 84p at £14.15. Burberry has declined 50p to £10.73 on concerns about the luxury goods market in Asia in any severe downturn - Japanese sales account for around 5% of revenues, according to analysts. But RBS reckons the fall in its shares might be overdone and added: Burberry has a legal provision in place to enforce a minimum guarantee payment from its Japanese licence partner of around £50m. At this juncture, it is unclear as to whether Burberry will go ahead and enforce this payment under the circumstances and we would question the impact on the brand and future sales should Burberry enforce the provision if the status quo in Japan deteriorates over the coming months. Brent crude - pushed high recently by supply concerns given events in Libya and the Middle East - has fallen more than 4% on the concerns about a global slowdown, so BP is 17.45p lower at 441.85p. International Airlines Group - formed from the merger of British Airways and Spain's Iberia - is down 8p at 221.8p, on the basis of cancelled flights to Japan and consumer reluctance to carry on flying at the moment. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index, said: The markets are now in correction mode and enduring some of the worst sessions seen for some time. To see the Nikkei lose as much as 14% this morning at one point has sent a shiver down the spines of European traders who were already concerned with the tensions in North Africa and the Middle East whilst European debt problems remain on the horizons. We have the huge costs of the tsunami in Japan to consider whilst the potential nuclear ramifications are developing with each hour. We also have continuing tensions in Libya and the Middle East and let's not forget traders are still uneasy about the implications of sovereign debt on nations such as Spain and Portugal. It's the perfect storm of negative sentiment and has all come to a head this week. This fact is further typified by the FTSE Volatility index, a market gauge of trader fear or pessimism, which has rallied 30% to its highest point since June last year. The FTSE 100 is now trading 8% off its February highs and with the near term momentum gaining towards the downside, traders could be waiting for the UK index to hit the 5500 level before being enticed back into the market. But with tensions remaining on several fronts, sentiment in the market remains particularly fragile. Apart from Next, up 30p at £18.98 on the back of falling cotton prices and a recommendation from Credit Suisse, the only other riser in the leading index is Scottish and Southern Energy. It has climbed 4p to £11.88 on the thought that any changes to nuclear programmes in the wake of the Japanese meltdown could benefit the company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2011/apr/06/king-olav-norway-selhurst-park","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-05T23:07:00Z","webTitle":"Did King Olav V of Norway really take a trip to Selhurst Park?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/06/king-olav-norway-selhurst-park","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2011/apr/06/king-olav-norway-selhurst-park","fields":{"headline":"Did King Olav V of Norway really take a trip to Selhurst Park?","bodyText":"\"Last week, the prime minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, visited Belgrade,\" wrote Vedrana Nikolic. \"After meetings with our officials he showed up at a football game between two youth teams: Belgrade's Red Star and St Petersburg's Zenit. Many of my colleagues claimed it was the first time in history that one foreign high official visited any football game which wasn't the finale of some big competition. I am pretty sure they are wrong, but I hope that you could help me prove it to them.\" Putin's visit to the Red Star Stadium is an interesting one. The club report that 25,000 fans turned up to watch the game between the two youth teams (a decent gate, and possibly a record for a youth team friendly, although not quite matching some of the crowds at senior level), while the Russian PM watched the game in the company of some unusual acquaintances – a group of Macedonian and Serbian bikers. \"Having met each other for the first time at a bike show in Sevastopol last year,\" records the Russian government's website, \"Putin and the bikers exchanged cordial greetings and went to watch the football game. \"The fans at the stadium greeted the Russian prime minister with a storm of applause, waving Russian flags and chanting 'Russia.' Some fans even held Putin's portrait. After the announcement that Putin was in the stadium, the fans began singing Katyusha, a popular Soviet wartime song, while setting off flares.\" And, as this footage shows, that's not spin … Speaking of spin, here's Alister Campbell (no, not that one), with another football-loving Russian: \"The Russian prime minister, Alexander Kosygin, was visiting Scotland in 1967, and on 11 February, he was presented to the players on the pitch pre-match at Kilmarnock v Rangers before watching the game.\" To be fair to Kosygin, he probably needed to unwind. As the Guardian reported before his visit: \"He will have five rounds of talks with Harold Wilson before leaving on Friday evening for a brief visit to Scotland where he will see the Hunsterson nuclear power station and watch the Kilmarnock versus Rangers football match.\" Talks with the PM, visit to nuclear power station, trip to Rugby Park – all in a weekend's work. But it's not just the big men from Moscow who have enjoyed the beautiful game on foreign shores. \"King Alphonso XIII of Spain was at Stamford Bridge on 1 November 1919 to watch Chelsea beat Bradford Park Avenue 4-0 in a run of the mill Division One match,\" writes Warren Lyons. \"It was perhaps not all that bizarre given his fondness for football. It was his patronage that led to the \"Real\" in the names of Real Madrid, Real Betis and Real Sociedad.\" More recently, Bertie Ahern was a regular visitor to Old Trafford while Taoiseach of Ireland, while mystery surrounds an intriguing visit by King Olav V of Norway to Selhurst Park. Kevin Burgess reports that: \"It was in the 1970s, we were in the old third division,\" but the club's press office could find no reference of the Nordic visitor and even the mighty tool that is Twitter struggled to stir up anything other than vague recollections (thanks to @mikesinnerton and @ChristopherHarv). There's even some doubt as to whether he visited Britain at all in the 70s.

APRIL FOOLS (2) Last week we looked at some of the 'best' April Fools' Day japes from the world of football. And, yes, we all had a good laugh. But, as Gretna discovered in 2007, not everyone can see the funny side. The club sent out a press release reporting that striker Kenny Deuchar, a qualified doctor, had landed a part on Holby City. The Carlisle News &amp; Star ran the false story on page four, while the Cumbrian Gazette splashed the news on their front page. \"Kenny Deuchar is a real character – there are not many doctors who are also professional footballers, and him landing a bit-part in Holby City was completely believable,\" fumed News &amp; Star deputy editor Richard Eccles after the hoax had been exposed. \"We couldn't believe it actually got printed,\" replied Gretna. Another creative effort came in Denmark in 1997. \"Following this late equaliser, which Brian Laudrup had scored a few days before in a very windy stadium in a World Cup qualifying match against Croatia,\" begins Henrik Nielsen, \"It was explained in the news that the Croatian FA had complained to the Uefa, claiming that the seldom used 'following wind clause' in the Uefa rules should be applied, as the goal was scored with a following wind of more than 15 metres per second, and would otherwise not have been possible. The 1-1 result of the match was therefore likely to be reconsidered, and the Danish qualification for the tournament was in jeopardy.\" More conventional that wind clauses and bit-parts in BBC dramas are the false transfer stories. Several Icelanders fell for the Bylgjan radio station's \"Diego Maradona to FC Fram\" story in 1991 (one, as Stefan Palsson recounts, involving a drugs ban loophole and the promise of playing for free for the club), Shoot magazine's front cover carried a picture of Ian Rush in an Everton shirt in the late 1980s, while Michael Deegan recalls the moment in 1995 when an Irish tabloid revealed that Shelbourne were set to sign a female player. \"Supposedly signed from Arsenal Ladies, this 'current Dutch International' was going to be seen as a watershed in talent acquisition. And the name of the footballer in question? 'Avril De Foyst.'\" 0-0 MARATHONS \"My team, Charlton Athletic, are currently on a run of 73 games without a goalless draw,\" wrote Jon Laysell last week. \"Is this a record?\" Sadly Addicks fans, it is not. Welsh Premier League side Cefn Druids went without a 0-0 from March 2006 to March 2010. \"Their run came to a rather unlikely end when they held eventual champions The New Saints to a goalless draw at Plas Kynaston,\" writes Seiriol Hughes. \"The Druids were relegated at the end of the season, but the oldest club in Wales are having a better time of it this season at their new home, The Rock, and have a good chance of promotion back to the Welsh top flight this year.\" But the Druids' record is under threat. \"A quick peak at the back of a Ladbrokes coupon (they show all manner of stats there) shows that Elgin City are currently on a run of 102 matches without a 0-0,\" writes Mark Wilson. Keep an eye on those Badgers. TEAMS GO DOWN, GATES GO UP (2) Controversy abounds after last week's look at record third tier attendances. \"I think that Alex Hannick was wrong to say that the Sheffield Boxing Day Massacre had the record attendance for a third tier league match in England,\" writes Jim Nicholson. \"Hull City's home match at Boothferry Park against Rotherham United, on Christmas Day 1948, in the Third Division (North) had an attendance of 49,655 – which is 346 more than the match in Sheffield. Not as many as the matches in Dusseldorf, Naples and Brazil mentioned – but it is one of the few English football records that the mighty Tigers can lay claim to.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Is Bhaichung Bhutia's six-month ban for joining India's version of Strictly Come Dancing the strangest reason for a suspension in football history?\" mused Ben Peters back in the sepia-tinged days of 2009. \"While the list of footballers suspended due to incidents involving drinking is not a short one, I think the one involving Saudi footballer Saeed al-Owairan is one of the more extreme,\" writes Tom McGovern. And he's not wrong. Al-Owairan, who scored the goal of the tournament during the 1994 World Cup against Belgium, would be punished for a decadent Western lifestyle which contravened the strict Islamic law of Saudi Arabia. First up, he left his club, Al Shabab, without permission for a two-week holiday in Morocco in 1995. Then, early the following year, he was spotted by the Saudi police cavorting with a group of women – including some non-Saudis – and flung in jail. \"It wasn't like a jail, jail,\" said a surprisingly chipper Al-Owairan at a later date. \"It was a detention centre, and I was held for questioning for several weeks.\" Other reports claimed Al-Owairan was undercooking the story slightly, and that his incarceration lasted for \"a little longer than six months\". The player was eventually released, and though he would be banned from football for a year, he did represent Saudi Arabia again, at the 1998 World Cup.

The price of gold – up 27% in the past 12 months and 50% in more than three years – is expected to continue to rise for at least another year to 18 months, as investors carry on shunning risk in favour of so-called safe haven assets. Gold is not the only precious metal on the up. Silver has hit a 31-year high, after jumping by more than 1% and breaching $44 an ounce. Its price has more than doubled in the past year, with one analyst, Brian Ostroff of Windermere Capital, describing it as \"gold on steroids\". However, while experts believe the rise in silver could end soon, many think the gold bull run has some way to go. Gold has benefited as rising inflation and historically low interest rates mean real interest rates are negative, making saving unattractive, while yields on competing safe haven assets such as US treasury bonds remain very low. Furthermore, escalating concerns about US debt – following the threat by Standard &amp; Poor's this week of a possible downgrade – and, in turn, the outlook for the US economy are pushing down the dollar, in which gold is priced. This means that, in addition to being seen as an increasingly risk-free and effective \"store of value\", gold's appeal as an alternative currency is also rising. Fears that unrest in the Middle East could spread and push the price of oil even higher, combined with uncertainty about the pace of the recovery in Japan following the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power crisis, have increased concerns about the global economy, again favouring the relative safety of gold. David Jollie, strategic analyst at Mitsui Precious Metals, said: \"The three biggest currencies – the US dollar, the euro and the yen – are all from regions with debt issues and we can see the potential for them to come under pressure from inflation and devaluation. Gold will benefit in its capacity as an alternative currency.\" Jollie predicts that gold could hit $1,610 by the end of the year and may well continue rising in the first half of 2012. City consultants Capital Economics forecasts the price could breach $2,000 by the end of next year. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we see a hiatus in the next month or two, as the markets take time to digest the recent increases, but the strength will return,\" said Neil Meander, research director of the GFMS metals consultancy. Analysts expect the inflationary pressure on gold to reduce in the coming months, since rising energy and other commodity prices are likely to hit demand and bring down their cost. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will complete its quantitative easing programme at the end of June, by which time it will have contributed significantly to US inflation by printing about $800bn (£500bn) of new money and spending it on government debt. However, slowing economic growth and lower inflation mean that interest rates are likely to remain low in the US and other major developed economies, meaning gold should remain relatively attractive, says John Higgins, of Capital Economics. \"Furthermore, there are plenty of candidates that could cause a fresh bout of risk aversion, including an escalation of the financial crisis in the eurozone,\" he added. Mitsui's Jollie says that a number of factors could put a stop to the seemingly inexorable rise in the price of gold, but regards a rise in US interest rates as the most likely trigger: \"Given the current economic situation, it doesn't seem likely that the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates sufficiently quickly within the next 12 months to prevent gold going higher. Beyond that, it becomes more likely and gold may run out of momentum.\" An increase in US interest rates would hit gold as it pushed down inflation – reducing the real interest rate – and increased the value of the dollar. The recent surge in the cost of silver – which soared by an astounding 80% last year, increased another 9.3% in January and February – is unlikely to continue. Speculators have piled into the metal, prompting a price increase that is unsustainable, analysts warned. Like gold, silver can be used for jewellery and as a safe haven, though to a lesser extent than its more expensive metal relative. But it is also widely used in industry, for example in connectors and switches in electronics, increasingly in photovoltaic solar-power cells and, decreasingly, in photographic film, making it more closely linked to industrial output. \"While investment and industrial purchasing have been important in driving the silver price higher, we believe rising prices have driven futures speculation. Although some of the strength in silver prices seems reasonable, it seems increasingly likely that there is some speculative froth in the price,\" said Jollie. Jollie believes the silver price is unsustainable in the longer term, but says it's possible the price could first exceed $50 if the speculation continues. The gold/silver ratio, traditionally about 50, has fallen to about 34.0, its lowest level since 1983.??"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/mar/28/counci-tax-bedroom-tax-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-28T15:50:53Z","webTitle":"Cameron moves John Hayes in mini reshuffle: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/mar/28/counci-tax-bedroom-tax-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/mar/28/counci-tax-bedroom-tax-live","fields":{"headline":"Cameron moves John Hayes in mini reshuffle: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• YouGov have released a poll suggesting that, if Boris Johnson were to replace David Cameron as their leader, the Conservatives would be neck and neck with Labour in the polls. • Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has welcomed the fact that Michael Fallon is replacing John Hayes as an energy minister in his department.

Both departments share a strong focus on business and the economy and I am delighted to be given the opportunity to build on their cross cutting work on this agenda. • New evidence has emerged showing that the Department for Work and Pensions produces a national sanctions \"scorecard\" that contains precise information about how jobcentre districts are performing on stopping people's benefits. As Patrick Wintour reports, the scorecard for January 2013 was sent to the Guardian after ministers and senior management denied that its information collection could be described as a \"league table\". It breaks down the sanctions performance by district, and includes a column headed \"direction of travel\", with red and green arrows showing whether a district is up or down on the previous month's performance. • The government has published figures showing that emissions of greenhouse gases went up by 3.5% in 2012. The document with the full details is available here (pdf). That's all from me for today. I'm off tomorrow and all next week. But I'm pleased to say we will be running the readers' edition while I'm away. Happy Easter everyone. Here's the Guardian's Politics Weekly podcast, with Rafael Behr, Andrew Gimson, Toby Helm and Hugh Muir discussing David Miliband, Boris Johnson and food stamps. Here's an afternooon reading list. • James Kirkup at the Telegraph says John Hayes’ appointment looks like an attempt by David Cameron to see off trouble from the backbenches. Removing the grandiloquent Mr Hayes from DECC may bring some peace to the quiet civil war taking place there over renewable energy policy: his promise to protect England’s green and pleasant land from wind farms may have pleased campaigners, but it has rattled potential investors in the UK, in a sector that the Government believes could play a key role in a UK economic recovery. Replacing him with the strongly pro-business Michael Fallon should reassure those investors without upsetting anti-wind Tories too much: Mr Fallon is rarely accused of not being Right-wing or robust enough. But what about Mr Hayes’ new job? He’s to be a minister without portfolio and senior parliamentary adviser to David Cameron, apparently, a job that was last occupied by Andrew MacKay in opposition and which has been vacant since his expenses-based downfall. Essentially, the job boils down to being the prime ministerial envoy and commissar to the increasingly restive Right of the Conservative Party. • Mark Ferguson at Labour List interviews Owen Smith, the shadow Welsh secretary. It’s then that Smith comes out with something that genuinely surprised me. I’ve been talking for months about Labour’s “F-word” – full employment – which the Resolution Foundation have been doing some very interesting work on, so it was heartening to hear that Smith believes that this is one of the “things we need to rediscover anew”: “In an era in which wages are being squeezed – have been squeezed – how many people are in work and how long people are in work for and how much money they earn, such that they are able to pay for the basics of a civilised lives. Traditional debates in the Labour movement are – I think – ripe for reconsideration. Shorthand for that, I think there’s a real debate to be had around what sort of a solution high employment – they used to call it full employment – might achieve for us.” “In an era in which the great ogre we face is lack of productivity, underemployment, unemployment and what the economists call hysterisis – which is permenant loss of capacity in the economy as a result of underemployment and unemployment of people who gradually lose skills and as they lose skills because they’re out of the workforce, that you gradually deplete the core skills base of your economy – and therefore you lock in a greater degree of unproductivity over the long run.” • Patrick Hennessy at the Telegraph says Damian McBride’s book will be the first from a member of Gordon Brown’s inner circle. What particularly intrigues me is that Damian is the first true inner-circle Brownite to go public in this way. Dan Hodges, my fellow Telegraph blogger, points out that Geoffrey Robinson wrote his memoirs – but that was in 2001 and Robinson’s role was, as the title of his book suggests, more paymaster than plotter. Since then, we have nothing from any of them: not from Ed Balls, Charlie Whelan, Ian Austin, Douglas Alexander, Nick Brown, Michael Dugher or Tom Watson (not forgetting, of course, Ed Miliband). Some of those will at some stage have been tempted to write a book but held back, at least partly through loyalty to Gordon. • Jonny Medland at Shifting Grounds says Labour needs a clearer policy on low pay. While the Conservatives still lack a plan for tackling the problem of low pay, and of living standards for those at the bottom of the income spectrum, our previous method of seeking to combat low pay via tax credits will likely be unavailable to us in 2015. The opportunity cost &amp; distributional implications of further raising the personal allowance makes that a poor idea. Instead we need to look deeper – at why it is so many people in the UK are forced to live on inadequate wages, and what sort of jobs can be created which offer the realistic prospect of sustainable, decent pay. The National Housing Federaton, which represents housing associations, has published a short report (pdf) strongly criticising the \"bedroom tax\". Here are the key arguments from the news release explaining why the federation is so opposed. In the north of England families with a spare room outnumber overcrowded families by three to one so thousands will be hit by the bedroom tax despite there being no local need for them to move. The mismatch between people living in overcrowded homes who need to swap with those who have a spare room works only on paper and nationally. In reality, to make it work you would have to move thousands of families thousands of miles. If those people do choose to move there are simply not enough smaller social homes available for all 660,000 households affected by the bedroom tax to move to, and If everyone affected did decide to move, many would have to go into the more expensive private rented sector, which would mean in some cases housing benefit claims could actually increase. Meanwhile, if disabled people in adapted properties moved into smaller homes this could also cost the taxpayer millions more in costly home adaptations. Some 77 per cent of people on Disability Living Allowance live in the social housing sector and two thirds of the people hit by the bedroom tax are disabled. Around 100,000 households live in properties adapted for their needs, some through local authority grants at an average cost of £6,000. The Press Gazette has published an interesting interview that four journalism students have conducted with the BBC's Eddie Mair. It covers the art of interviewing generally, but also Mair's showdown on Sunday with Boris Johnson. Mair said that he thought Johnson interview was a success. We achieved what we wanted out of it, which was to look in detail at some of the stuff that appeared in the documentary that is a less cuddly picture of Boris than the public know, and to get him to talk about that ... In terms of interviews I suppose as a journalist you want to get people to say things that haven’t been said before or ideally I want to make an interviewee think in an interview. Because often politicians have got their brief, their notes and have a message they want to stick to ... To be honest this is one of the things with Boris today. I think we made him think a little, or at least slightly unsettled him from his usual, very measured and very confident performance – it was about trying to examine other aspects of his past and his character. Let's go back to the welfare cuts (which were going to be the focus of the blog today - see 9.10am - until the mini reshuffle came along). The Unite union is launching a new advertising campaign against the cuts. And it has set up a website which it says will promote the truth about welfare. Here's a comment from Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey. The welfare changes coming in from 1 April are no joke for the millions of households who will be made poorer and the hundreds of thousands of kids who face being plunged into poverty. While the government unleashes misery and demonises those struggling to get by, millionaires will be laughing as they pocket tax breaks averaging £100,000 a year. We are saying ‘enough’. Unite will not let the truth be a casualty of this government's war on the poor. We will not allow the government to get away with conning the British public. • David Cameron has moved his controversial minister John Hayes from the department of energy and climate change, bringing him to No 10 to help improve the frayed links between the prime minister and his Tory MPs. As Patrick Wintour reports, Michael Fallon, recently installed as business minister, will take the place of Hayes, in a move that should improve damaged coalition relations within the department. There had been a running war between the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, and Hayes over renewable energy, especially policy on wind farms. A new permanent secretary may have realised that the department was becoming dysfunctional, and those in the energy business said it was increasingly difficult to understand the direction of government policy, including on subsidies, prices and targets. Hayes will be Cameron's senior parliamentary adviser, based in the Cabinet Office as a minister without portfolio. But Labour and the TaxPayers' Alliance have both criticised Cameron for allowing Hayes to collect a ministerial salary for doing what seems to be a party job. This is from Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary. It is worrying that, at a time when the energy bill is still going through parliament, crucial negotiations for nuclear power are ongoing and investors are losing confidence with this government, David Cameron has chosen to appoint a part-time energy minister. In the next decade Britain needs to attract over £100bn of investment to keep the lights on. But David Cameron appears to think that keeping tabs on his unruly Tory backbenchers is more important than the country's energy policy. David Cameron now has four ministers without portfolio, paid for by the taxpayer, but only one part-time energy minister. And this Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance. Since the prime minister is on record as wanting to cut back 'big government', taxpayers have every right to ask why he hasn't made any attempt to reduce the number of ministers on the payroll. What's more, people will be increasingly concerned that he is using taxpayers' money for party management purposes now that there are no fewer than three people holding the title 'minister without portfolio'. • The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has published a report saying more than 2m of the poorest households in England will pay more council tax from next week because of benefit changes coming into force. Sir Merrick Cockell, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, said that councils were not to blame the fact that so many people will lose out when local authorities take responsibility for paying council tax benefit from next month. The problem with all this is it’s a new responsibility passed to local councils by government but when they did that they cut £400m from the budget at the same time. And of course, that money has to come from somewhere. It’s either passed on to people, many of whom in the past haven’t paid any council tax, or you have to find some other way of meeting that reduction in your budget. • Nick Clegg has said that councils should not encourage people to become foster parents simply as a means of avoiding the \"bedroom tax\". on his LBC phone-in, he took a call from a woman in Ealing who said the council had suggested that she take up fostering to avoid the \"tax\". Clegg condemned this. I think it is not right for Ealing council to take what was an exemption that we announced a couple of weeks ago when we said foster families will not be covered by this and then to use that locally to say 'why don't you turn yourself into a foster family?' Ealing Council later said today that foster care applicants would not be approved if their \"sole motivation\" was financial gain. • Three Lib Dem ministers have said the oil and gas industry will play a vital role in British energy needs for decades to come. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, Vince Cable, the business secretary, and Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, made the pledge on a visit to Aberdeen where they published the government's oil and gas sector strategy. • Damian McBride, Gordon Brown's former spin doctor, has announced that he is publishing his memoirs. His book, Power Trip: A Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin, will be published on September 23 - during Labour's autumn conference - and will cover his 10 years working for Brown, including the feud with Tony Blair at the top of New Labour. Biteback have paid a \"five-figure advance\" for the book, and royalties will be split between the Catholic aid agency Cafod, where McBride now works, and the appeal by his former employers Finchley Catholic High School to build a new sixth-form centre. Iain Dale, who runs Biteback, has written a blog about how he came to be publishing the book. (As regular readers of this blog will know, I regularly link to McBride's blog because he writes exceptionally well and candidly about his time in government. The book should be a corker.) • Lord Ahmed has apologised for his comments blaming Jewish-owned news organisations for the fact that he was jailed in 2009 for dangerous driving. (See 12.03pm.) • Eric Joyce has been told he will not MP will not face charges following his arrest over an alleged brawl in a House of Commons bar. Scotland Yard said it would be taking no further action against the MP for Falkirk, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent, following the incident earlier this month. \"A man aged in his 50s, arrested on Thursday 14 March on suspicion of assault and ABH in connection with a disturbance in a bar within the House of Commons, and bailed to a central London police station has been released with no further action today,\" the Yard said in a statement. • Cameron has visited the Nissan car plant in Sunderland to mark the start of production of the new, 100% electric Nissan LEAF. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has been talking about the loss of John Hayes. As Damian Carrington reports, that's not the way most people saw it. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories published yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories, and here's the the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. And here are two articles I found particularly interesting. • Philip Collins at the Times (paywall) says that there is a straightforward reason for David Miliband's departure from British politics. The truth lies deeper than that and much closer to home. I think the former Foreign Secretary reacted with maturity and decorum to losing the Labour leadership to his brother, the most disappointing moment of his life. He grew as a politician by the loss and, strangely, became a much better potential leader of the Labour Party once it was clear that it wasn’t going to happen. But it is in the void of what happened between two brothers, in the strangest episode I can recall in politics, that we find the truth. Ed won a victory from which David never really recovered. You would have to be hard of heart not to understand this and wish this capable, kind and good man well in what he does next ... I used to collect declarations of the end of new Labour and it is a delight to see the idea exhumed for the pleasure of being able to declare it dead again. In the sense that a lot of political success is just turning up, this is clearly true. New Labour is not so much dead as doing other jobs. Blair, Mandelson, Reid, Milburn, Hutton, Purnell and now Miliband senior have all left. But it’s quite wrong to couple David Miliband’s departure with the demise of Blairism, whatever that is, as though one embodies the other. • Peter Oborne in the Daily Telegraph says he won't miss David Miliband. Mr Miliband – and this is the essential point – set the pattern that so many others, including his brother Ed, have followed. Obsessed by politics at university (like Ed and David Cameron, he read PPE at Oxford), he has never had even the faintest connection with the real world. From life in think tanks he became a Labour Party researcher and special adviser, before being parachuted into the north-eastern constituency of South Shields as an MP ... Like his mentors Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson, Mr Miliband is one of that unappetising breed of modern politician that has chosen to profiteer out of public service. It is a pity that the BBC did not ask him whether his sudden decision to abandon his constituents was not informed by a desire to keep his huge earnings out of the public eye. During his short, undistinguished career, Mr Miliband has done grave damage to British politics. He is part of the new governing elite which is sucking the heart out of our representative democracy while enriching itself in the process. He may be mourned in the BBC and in north London, but the rest of us are entitled to form a more realistic view. David Miliband has belittled our politics and he will not be missed. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Lord Ahmed has issued an unreserved apology for his comments blaming Jewish-owned news organisations for the fact that he was jailed in 2009 for dangerous driving. Here's an extract. In an exclusive interview with the Huffington Post UK, the peer - who has been suspended from the Labour Party pending an investigation - said he had \"the greatest respect\" for the Jewish community and could not \"believe [the video] when I saw it\". He said his comments were \"completely wrong\", \"unacceptable\" and the product of a \"twisted mind\" - but took \"full responsibility\" for them. Ahmed said he is \"not anti-Semitic\" and pointed out that, since entering the House of Lords in 1998, he has had \"the honour of addressing the World Jewish Congress in 2000... working with the Maimonides Foundation, One Voice, the Joseph Interfaith Foundation, going to Israel and synagogues here in the UK.\" Asked why he had made such offensive and conspiratorial remarks, Ahmed replied: \"I don’t really have any explanation or excuse.\" And here is what two of the main environment charities are saying about the reshuffle. This is from Doug Parr, director of policy at Greenpeace. Britain is at a crossroads, with decisions being made now that will define how we get and use energy for the next 30-40 years. As such, Michael Fallon has a real opportunity to clean up our power sector, capitalise on clean, home-grown energy and properly open Britain for green business. In opposition he authored a law to drive investment in renewable energy, and as deputy chairman of the Conservatives he described the renewables sector as “the work force of tomorrow\". We look forward to him putting this vision into practice and safeguarding green jobs and growth. And this is from Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth. The development of a safe, clean and affordable energy system must be a top priority for Michael Fallon. It’s time to stop tilting at windmills - the new Minister must recognise the potential of developing Britain’s substantial renewable energy resources and harvest the huge economic and environmental benefits this will bring. The nation’s headlong dash for gas is speeding UK energy policy in the wrong direction – we need a 2030 clean power target in the Energy Bill to put it on the right track. My colleague Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, has sent me this on the decision to replace John Hayes with Michael Fallon. The department charged with keeping the lights on, stopping energy bills payers getting fleeced and fighting the greatest challenge to civilisation we face – climate change – has been a very unhappy happy place. John Hayes, today moved out after just seven months as a minister and in the middle of the flagship energy bill, provoked extraordinary rows with this nominal boss, the LibDem secretary of state Ed Davey, defying him to give a speech lambasting wind farms and leading Davey to take legal advice about whether his rogue minister was opening up the department to judicial challenge on its renewable energy policies. The reason for the seething tension is that the green agenda is one of the bitterest coalition crunch points. The Lib Dems are desperate to hang onto their green credentials, one of the few areas in which they lead all the main parties in public opinion, while a significant section of backbench Tory MPs loathe what they see as ludicrously expensive environmental fripperies. Hayes is now off to tackle the more general discontent among the troublesome backbenchers but had been brought in, it was said, to “duff up” Daveyand get a win for those shire Tories terrified of losing votes over wind farms. He replaced Charles Hendry, who had been well regarded by most in the energy industry, but perhaps not by Lord John Browne, who he had taken to task over problems at the shale gas company Lord Browne chairs. Adding to the turbulence at the department of energy and climate change was the loss of Chris Huhne, now in jail, and the ousting of permanent secretary Moira Wallace, who had rowed with ministers. Even the replacement of Wallace caused waves, with the candidate selected by the recruitment process then blackballed by prime minister David Cameron. The turmoil reflects the high political stakes in the arena of energy and climate change, and it remains to be seen whether Hayes's part-time replacement Michael Fallon can work better with Davey. The ongoing row between DECC and George Osborne's Treasury makes its vital that it does, if Decc is to win sufficient funding for its work. But the fallout of all this is significant for everyone in the UK: we all pay energy bills and we all suffer when floods and droughts hit. Renewing our creaking energy system and curbing global warming are both very long games, involving complex policies costing hundreds of billions of pounds. That requires continuity between governments over decades, yet the coalition has failed to maintain continuity over months. And Damian has posted this on Twitter. John Hayes is a relatively obscure minister, but he's interesting for various reasons. Partly because, as energy minister, he seemed to joyfully embrace the role of the bête noire of the environmentalist lobby. Party because it's a Conservative from a working class background. And partly because his beliefs are relatively unusual; he's a Tory communitarian, with even faith in the \"Big Society\" than David Cameron. This came out well in an interview that Hayes did with the House magazine earlier this year. This is what he said about being a working class Tory. I am the personification of Blue Collar Conservatism. My childhood was idyllic because it was the perfect childhood, in a secure, loving home, a secure, loving working class home. I grew up on a council estate in south east London, a council maisonette, with my parents. I adored my father, I loved my mother. I had all that I desired. They made me feel like the most special boy in the world. It was a golden age. I’m very proud of my working class roots and I’m very proud of working class culture. I’m a trade union member, my father was a shop steward, my grandfather was chairman of his branch. My friends in the TUC tell me I romanticise the working class too much. But I have a romantic view of working class culture. I loved that world. This is what he said about civil society. Society has a duty to create the circumstances in which those civil institutions [family] can flourish. Civil institutions that comprise a kind of reasonable society are what makes life tolerable. If you take the Tory view, and I do regard it as a Tory view, which of course springs from the Christian understanding that man is fallen, [to be] freed from all of that, life would be nasty, brutish and short. Freed from all the obligations, the social norms, the civil institutions, the habits, the purpose and the vocation that springs from all of that, we would be living in a state of nature, which would be awful. You have to believe in all those great institutions like the law, and Parliament and the church and monarchy, and the small institutions like the Burkean little platoons, you have to believe in those if you believe that the alternative would be chaos. And this is what he said about \"Tory toff\". I appreciate that not everyone starts with the advantage of a working class background and so I try to be benevolent towards those that don’t. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative backbencher, has an interesting line on the Hayes/Fallon reshuffle. Goldsmith is referring to the fact that Hayes was dealing with the energy bill, which is mid way through its passage through the House of Commons. Tory sources are defending the decision to pay John Hayes a ministerial salary for what looks like a party job. (See 10.45am). Hayes and Fallon are being paid the same as they were, so there is no extra costs to the taxpayer, they say. And he will be a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, working on a range of government issues and liaising with parliament. They are certainly talking up Hayes' job. \"This is a big step up for him,\" I was told. He will have the title \"senior parliamentary adviser\" to Cameron and he will attend the daily Number 10 strategy meetings at 8.30am and 4pm. He has been given the job because he is seen as someone with \"a good relationship with the parliamentary party\". What's not clear, though, is whether he will do as much media as Michael Fallon did when he was playing the \"greybeard\" role as Conservative deputy chairman. Asked if Hayes would be doing the \"minister for the Today programme role\", I was told that would depend what the issue of the day was. Downing Street sources are saying that John Hayes, as David Cameron's new adviser, will be taking the senior \"greybeard\" role that Michael Fallon used to play before he became a business minister last year. Fallon, you will remember, frequently appeared on the media defending the Conservatives. He was also in the Downing Street loop. But he was doing that role as a Conservative deputy chairman. As Patrick Wintour points out (see 10.34am), it is not entirely clear why the taxpayer needs to fund Hayes in his new role. Here's some more Twitter comment on the reshuffle. From the Financial Times's Jim Pickard From the BBC's Norman Smith From the Sun's Tom Newton Dunn From the Independent's Oliver Wright From Labour MP Jon Ashworth From the Guardian's Patrick Wintour From Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary From the Conservative MP Dan Byles David Cameron has been tweeting about the reshuffle. To me that sounds as if Cameron thinks Hayes needs rather more consoling this morning than Fallon. Fallon has had his role beefed up. Hayes seems to be doing what is effectively a glorified PPS's job. James Bloodworth at Left Foot Forward says that Michael Fallon, the new energy minister, is on record as questioning whether climate change targets are sensible. \"Fallon’s predecessor was criticised by green activists for his views on wind farms, but going by statements like this, Fallon may be even worse,\" Bloodworth says. Apparently that's not Ed Davey's view. The energy secretary is in Aberdeeon launching the government's oil and gas sector strategy, and he is due to give interviews later. One source said that he will be pleased about the mini reshuffle because he gets on well with Michael Fallon and thinks he will be a good person to finish taking the energy bill through parliament. It's no secret that Davey's relationship with Hayes was strained. Here's the formal announcement from Downing Street. The Queen has been pleased to approve the following ministerial appointments: John Hayes MP to become a Minister without Portfolio (Minister of State); Rt Hon Michael Fallon MP to become a Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change in addition to his current role as a Minister of State at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Hayes will be based in the Cabinet Office, and he will also become a privy councillor. Depending on how you look at it, that's either a signal of the high regard in which David Cameron holds him, or a consolation prize to make up for the fact he will no longer have a proper ministerial job. And Tim Montgomerie has a useful take on the reshuffle too, at ConservativeHome. Here's an extract. Hayes will be acting as a political and parliamentary adviser to the PM and will, I hope, be doing a lot more media. His non-southern, non-posh voice is one the Conservatives lack. He is a curious mix of Right-wing and One Nation. He signs up to nearly all traditional Tory positions on immigration, Europe, crime and the family (especially the family) but he's not much of a liberal when it comes to economic matters. Although a businessman before entering politics he's never been much of a fan of free trade. He sees a large role for the state in providing a social safety-net and underpinning UK manufacturing. Cameron's decision to bring Hayes into his inner team - a team that doesn't understand working class Conservatives - is a very good one. Hayes recently claimed to be the personification of blue collar conservatism. Benedict Brogan, who I think was the first to break the Hayes/Fallon news on Twitter, has posted an instant analysis on his Telegraph blog which is well worth reading. Here's an extract. The appointment of Michael Fallon to the energy brief will delight everyone. He is one of the proper grown-ups in the Government, economically dry as a bone, ambitious in policy, open to radical ideas, and as a Scot and a former Northern MP who has made a great success in business, he is miles away from the metropolitan gilded smugness that some find too apparent in government these days. His job will be to bring some hard-nosed economics to DECC, while managing the politics of a Lib Dem controlled department, which Mr Hayes signally failed to do. Mr Fallon is happy to advertise his contempt for the yellow peril, but he is also politically smart and has been able to forge a working relationship with Vince Cable that has been surprisingly productive. To recap, here's what we know about today's mini reshuffle. • John Hayes is being replaced as an energy minister. After less than seven months at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, he has been appointed as David Cameron's senior parliamentary adviser. • Michael Fallon, the business minister, will take over Hayes' duties at DECC. He will also remain a minister in the Department for Business. Here's some instant Twitter reaction to the Hayes/Fallon reshuffle. From the Telegraph's Benedict Brogan From the Times's Michael Savage From PoliticsHome's Paul Waugh From ConservativeHome's Tim Montgomerie From ConservativeHome's Paul Goodman There's a mini government reshuffle underway. John Hayes was made energy minister last year, but it was not a happy appointment. A sceptic about wind farms, Hayes and his boss, the Lib Dem energy secretary Ed Davey, almost seemed to be at war with each other. On his LBC, a woman called Lisa from Ealing has just been asking Nick Clegg about the \"bedroom tax\". She said she had two boys under 16 and that she was unhappy about the fact that they were both expected to share a bedroom. She was also particularly unhappy that Ealing had suggested to her that she should become a foster parent to get an exemption from the \"bedroom tax\". Clegg said that the rules about when children were expected to share a room were inherited from Labour. But he said he was \"not happy at all\" about a council like Ealing encouraging people to go into fostering just to evade the \"bedroom tax\". Westminster is sliding into holiday mode. The Commons and the Lords are now in recess, the government news grid is starting to look very thin and the Easter bank holiday weekend is almost here. In conventional news terms, it’s pretty bleak. But actually, beneath the headlines, some big stuff is happening. A raft of benefit cuts are going to come into force next week and, collectively, they are going to make millions of people poorer. There are two developments today that highlight some of these changes. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has published a report saying that 2.m low-income families will pay on average £138 more in council tax next year as a result of the way council tax benefit is being cut. Here’s an extract from its news release. The findings from the New Policy Institute (NPI) are the first, full assessment of Council Tax Benefit (CTB) reform. From next Monday (April 1), CTB will be abolished and replaced by Council Tax Support. England’s 326 local councils have had to devise their own local CTS schemes, but with 10% less funding. Pensioners are protected - meaning larger proportional cuts are passed onto working-age recipients. Fifty-eight councils have decided on schemes that will retain current levels of support for families, but the majority (232) will demand council tax from everyone regardless of income. In-work families will pay £132 more on average compared to £140 for those not working. 150,000 families will pay on average £300 more a year; one million will pay less than £100 on average. 1.9 million claimants who currently do not pay any council tax will have to start paying on average £140 per year. There is a detailed summary of the findings here (pdf). And, in the Independent, the Labour former welfare minister Frank Field has been speaking out about the bedroom cuts. He is calling for direct action. Mr Field said he had never witnessed a measure as “grossly unfair” as the bedroom tax in his 30 years of dealing with welfare reforms as the MP for Birkenhead. He said: “I feel so strongly about what the Government are doing to my constituents and similarly placed constituents around the country that I call on both social housing and housing association landlords to defy the measures, not by not operating them, but by doing what landlords did after the Nine Years’ War, when a Government similarly stretched for money imposed a window tax. “In many instances – we see it in older properties in our constituencies – landlords bricked up windows. I hope landlords will brick up the doors to spare bedrooms and, where appropriate, knock down the walls, so that the properties can safely fit the tenants. I have never before asked for direct action. I do so now because I feel the measures are grossly unfair.” Throughout the day I will be reporting more on reaction to next week’s benefit cuts. Here’s the agenda for the day. 9am: Nick Clegg takes part in his LBC phone-in. 10am: The London assembly questions Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner. At some point today Ed Davey, the energy secretary, Vince Cable, the business secretary, and Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, are publishing an oil and gas sector strategy.

Olson, Ambassador, State, US Embassy Abu Dhabi, UAE; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 1. (S/NF) Summary: During a December 9 meeting in Abu Dhabi (other meetings reported septel), Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman told Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) that the USG shared many energy policy priorities with the UAE, including renewable energy development and the importance of critical energy infrastructure protection. Poneman briefed MbZ on the Teheran Research Reactor (TRR) proposal and Vienna talks. MbZ said he would be surprised if Iran accepted the P5+1/IAEA proposal and warned that Iran was already acting like a nuclear power. Further, and more dangerously, Iran is establishing \"emirates\" across the Muslim world, including South Lebanon and Gaza, sleeper \"emirates\" in Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, the mother of all \"emirates\" in Southern Iraq, and now Saada in Yemen. MbZ suggested that the U.S. is misreading the situation in Yemen and failing to recognize strong evidence of Iranian support. End Summary. POTENTIAL COOPERATION: RENEWABLES, INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION ------------------------------------- 2. (SBU) The Crown Prince asked DepSec Poneman several questions about U.S. energy development plans, including the outlook for the next 25 years. Poneman explained President Obama and Secretary Chu have a strategic vision of a new energy economy with a low carbon profile. In the short term, Poneman said DOE is investing Recovery Act funds to improve efficiency and support new technologies, but that the USG seeks to facilitate energy development through a portfolio approach, not dictate what the market should pursue. On nuclear, MbZ specifically asked what progress could be expected within the next three years. Poneman said there are a number of active deals under development, and strong public support for nuclear power, but that capital costs continue to be a challenge. (Comment: MbZ pressed hard on US plans for a nuclear renaissance, suggesting to us that he is worried we may compete with his program in the hunt for nuclear engineering and technical talent. End Comment.) Turning to renewable energy and efficiency, the DepSec noted that USG goals are very much in line with Abu Dhabi's own Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company) and that he looked forward to greater DOE-Masdar cooperation (septel). 3. (SBU) Poneman also told MbZ that the USG is interested in supporting Abu Dhabi's critical energy infrastructure protection (CEIP) plans and said a DOE team was discussing cooperation potential with the Critical National Infrastructure Authority (CNIA, reported septel). Learning from Hurricane Katrina, DOE was focused on survivability of assets, resiliency and recovery. MbZ said he was personally very interested in greater cooperation with the U.S. on CEIP, through DOE, other USG entities and/or the private sector. He stressed that citizens' confidence in their government was very important, noting \"We're doing our best to make them feel secure.\" MbZ added that while UAE is a small country, it has the resources to protect itself, and is willing to invest in top-quality infrastructure protection. IRAN ---- 4. (S/NF) DepSec Poneman briefed MbZ on the international proposal for Iran to ship 1,200 kg of Low Enriched Uranium produced at Natanz to a location outside Iran and where it would be enriched to 20 percent for use to produce medical radioisotopes at the Tehran Research Reactor. Poneman stressed that the IAEA, the Russians, and the U.S. had all taken every possible step to address stated Iranian concerns, including a first-ever official USG statement of support for the proposal. He stressed that the offer would not remain open indefinitely; as DG El Baradei had said, this is a \"fleeting\" opportunity. He also explained that the extra effort had strengthened international cooperation, with Russia and China supportive of the recent IAEA Board of Governors resolution. Poneman stressed that the deal was not offered out of naivete, but rather out of the view that if Iran agreed it would remove a significant amount of LEU from Natanz and if Iran refused it would help build international support - beginning with Russia and China - for tougher sanctions. 5. (S/NF) The Crown Prince said he would be \"very surprised\" if a deal was possible, as Iran's nuclear program is not an issue of internal conflict but rather one of national pride for the vast majority of Iranians. He stressed that Iran is not North Korea, because 1) it is looking to reestablish a Persian empire in the 21st century, 2) Iran has resources and lacks neighbors, including the UAE, who can pressure it, 3) the leadership has not changed (it is the same people who seized Embassy Tehran in 1979) , and 4) Iran believes itself to be a superpower. Poneman said the USG does not disagree with MbZ's analysis, but believes pride makes the Iranian leadership more susceptible to the pressure of the world community uniting against them, whereas North Korea revels in its own isolation. MbZ agreed, and emphasized the strategic importance of creating a Palestinian State (i.e., resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) as the way to create genuine Middle Eastern unity on the question of Iran's nuclear program and regional ambitions. YEMEN ----- 6. (S/NF) MbZ said Iran already acts like a superpower and explained that, while the UAE is a federation of emirates, Iran's \"emirates\" have a larger army and budget that the UAE. In addition to Iran's established emirates in South Lebanon and Gaza, sleeper emirates in Kuwait, Bahrain, the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and the mother of all emirates in Southern Iraq. Now Iran has an emirate in Saada. MbZ told Poneman, \"We believe you don't want us to believe\" the mounting evidence of Iranian involvement in Yemen. He stressed that he doesn't believe Ali Abdullah Saleh either, but this is \"not like cracking the enigma code\" (in World War II), there are Iranian ships unloading weapons for the Houthis, and \"you have the capability to track this.\" He warned, \"We know your priority is Al-Qaeda, but don't forget Iran. Al-Qaeda is not going to get a nuclear bomb; Iran is a matter of time.\" 7. (SBU) DepSec Poneman has cleared this cable.

Well, nearly perfect. Some time in the mid-1960s, James Lovelock, a scientist of international distinction, and his friend William Golding, destined to win the Nobel prize for literature, were taking a walk near the Wiltshire village of Bowerchalke, to which they had both retreated to escape the conventions of gainful employment. Lovelock expounded his almost mystical idea that the Earth and all the plants and animals that inhabit it are a massive, self-regulating entity. Life and Earth are one. All that Lovelock lacked was a name for his hypothesis. Golding, master of literature, had the answer: Gaia, mythological goddess of the Earth. The problem was that Lovelock thought Golding was suggesting \"gyre\", a sort of giant whirlpool in the ocean. \"They're not self regulating,\" he laughs. \"We walked on for 20 minutes talking at complete cross purposes.\" If it had ended up as the Gyre hypothesis, Lovelock may have suffered less flak from evolutionary and mathematical biologists as eminent as Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould and John Maynard Smith. They all sniped at the new-ageist notion of a self-regulating living Earth in which the evolution of all species is coupled through their shared environment. Lovelock protests that Gaia, the goddess, is just a metaphor. The name has stuck. And he says, most opponents \"in private\" now admit he's right. It's paradoxical that Lovelock, the futurist, lives more like an 18th-century scientist, pottering in a barn that doubles as his lab. He was born in Letchworth in 1919, son of Nell, who worked in a pickle factory, and Tom, who had done six months' hard labour for poaching. They moved to London and James had to take a job at a photography company to help support his ageing parents. \"I learned more science there than I did at university,\" says Lovelock. \"The most important thing they taught me is never, ever to cheat.\" The owner recognised his talents and paid for him to attend evening classes at Birkbeck College, and he won a place to study chemistry at Manchester, worked for a while on a Quaker farm, and then, in 1941, went to the Medical Research Council's National Institute in Hampstead as a research student. He \"wandered around the institute\" asking people for problems to solve – \"a wonderful way of getting around,\" he says. \"As soon as they hear you can invent something they come with their problems – a great way of making friends.\" He tells the story of making a device to measure mercury vapour and discovering that a pressure chamber designed to study the physiological reactions of divers was so saturated with mercury it would have killed anyone who used it. Early in the second world war he registered as a conscientious objector. His views changed as news of Nazi atrocities emerged, but when he tried to enlist he was turned down because his research on ways of shielding soldiers from burns was considered more important. In 1961, after 20 years at the National Institute, just as he was beginning to feel that his work was \"dotting Is and crossing Ts\", Lovelock got a letter from Nasa inviting him to join the team working on the Viking programme, which hoped to detect life on Mars. Lovelock's job was to design sensors to measure the composition of the planet's atmosphere and soil. He recalls a pivotal event in 1965, in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. He was writing a paper with the astronomer Carl Sagan when a colleague burst in with news that French scientists, using equipment on Earth, had found that Mars is wrapped in a cloak of carbon dioxide. Lovelock immediately saw that this said more about the Earth than about Mars: our atmosphere is far from an inert equilibrium. It has changed dramatically through the 4.5bn years of its existence, and some of that change was undoubtedly caused by living things. His advice that the Viking probe was \"a waste of time\" fell on deaf ears. The mission went on, and two of Lovelock's instruments are still up there on the surface of Mars. \"I can look in the sky when Mars is visible and get a bit of pleasure from it,\" he says. After his return to Britain and self-exile to Wiltshire, he invented a device capable of detecting tiny concentrations of substances in the atmosphere, including the CFCs then used as refrigerants and aerosol propellants. A grant application to support the research failed but, in 1972, the Natural Environment Research Council offered him free passage on their research ship, the Shackleton. His measurements, compared with data from the manufacturer DuPont, produced the scary conclusion that most of the CFCs ever manufactured were still up there in the atmosphere. That was the start of the realisation that the ozone layer was being destroyed by our fridges and deodorants. It was a piece of practical environmental science that set standards for international co-operation and global action. It's hard to avoid the impression that Lovelock relishes his maverick image. He has been at the forefront of dire predictions about the consequences of global warming. \"Before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate is tolerable,\" he wrote in 2006. Yet he is vilified by the green movement for his enthusiasm for nuclear power. \"The public perception of the danger of the nuclear is that it's possibly the greatest danger there is,\" he responds. \"But the greatest danger is climate change itself.\" He is withering in his criticism of the \"scam\" of commercial exploitation of renewable technology – \"to produce solar voltaic energy in Britain does nothing except benefit German industry\" – and is still seen as an outsider by the stuffier cliques of academe. Yet, despite his gloomy prognostications – \"I think we expect too much of our scientists,\" he warns – he still bubbles with excitement at the possibility that cataclysmic disaster might be prevented by ocean pumps, or nanoparticles injected into the high atmosphere. Ever the inventor. • You can read all about the Observer Ethical Awards in a special edition of the Observer magazine this Sunday Observer Ethical Awards full winners list Local retailer: The People's Supermarket Online retailer: Riverford Organic Vegetables Campaigner sponsored by B&amp;Q: Compassion in World Farming Global campaigner: Greg Valerio Ecover ethical kids: Savy B.O.B Box Fashion and accessories sponsored by Vogue.com: Pachacuti Big idea sponsored by National Grid: Pavegan Grassroots sponsored by Timberland: The Bristol Bike Project Business sponsored by Jupiter Asset Management: The Co-operative Group Conservation: Thameside Nature Park Blog: Shirahime The Observer lifetime achievement award: James Lovelock"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/13/japan-nuclear-plants-fukushima-earthquake","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T19:39:29Z","webTitle":"Japan's nuclear fears intensify at two Fukushima power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-nuclear-plants-fukushima-earthquake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-nuclear-plants-fukushima-earthquake","fields":{"headline":"Japan's nuclear fears intensify at two Fukushima power stations","bodyText":"Fears of a major nuclear accident in Japan have intensified as authorities scramble to bring under control several overheating reactors at one power station, and declared a state of emergency at another, where radiation levels soared above normal limits. Workers at the Fukushima 1 power plant in the north-east pumped seawater into three reactors in a last-ditch attempt to make them safe, after emergency cooling systems failed to stabilise the radioactive cores. More than 200,000 people were evacuated as officials imposed a 20km exclusion zone around the power station and a 10km zone surrounding the Fukushima 2 power plant nearby. Officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency they would distribute potassium iodide pills as a precaution against an increased risk of thyroid cancer from radiation. The most urgent crisis was at Fukushima 1, where officials were braced for an explosion similar to one which blew the roof off the building housing reactor 1 on Saturday morning, after hydrogen escaped from the reactor as engineers vented steam from the pressurised vessel. The failure of the cooling system caused uranium fuel rods to overheat and split the cooling water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen exploded, devastating the building, but the containment vessel around the reactor was undamaged, said the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano. Desperate engineers were forced to vent steam from two other reactors at the power station before pumping in seawater, despite the risk of triggering further explosions. Edano said a partial meltdown of fuel rods in reactor 1 was possible, and engineers were pumping seawater into the others to stop the same happening there. He said the fuel rods in reactor 3 might be deformed, but a meltdown was unlikely. Reactor 3 uses a mixed-oxide fuel that contains plutonium, but the plant's operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said this did not present unusual problems. \"The use of seawater means they have run out of options,\" said David Lochbaum, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists nuclear safety project. Two of three diesel generators used to drive cooling pumps stopped working at the Tokai 2 nuclear plant, 75 miles north of Tokyo in Ibaraki prefecture. The intentional release of steam from reactors caused levels of radiation to rise around the Fukushima 1 power station. Levels at the station boundary reached 500 microsieverts an hour, a quarter of the annual dose the general population receives from natural background radiation. Tepco officials said radiation around the Fukushima 1 station had risen above the safety limit, but it did not mean an \"immediate threat\" to health. The radioactive substances released suggest at least part of the core in reactor 1 has broken down. Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency confirmed that caesium-137 and iodine-131 had been detected in the vicinity of the Fukushima power station. These radioactive isotopes are produced by fission reactions inside the core, and can only have contaminated the cooling water if fuel rods overheated and melted the cladding surrounding them. A state of emergency was declared at the Onagawa nuclear plant north of Sendai after radiation rose to 400 times the usual level, but officials said the increase was due to the Fukushima plant and was not a risk to health. The reactors at Onagawa were said to be under control, and officials later said that radioactivity levels \"at the site boundary\" of the plant had returned to normal. Paddy Regan, a nuclear physicist at Surrey University, said it could take several days to cool the reactors and make them safe. If any of the reactors continued to heat up, the core could go into complete meltdown. This raises the danger of a major release of radiation if the molten core breaches the containment vessel. The sheer scale of the crisis in Japan has stretched emergency services to breaking point and prompted criticism that authorities were ill-prepared for a natural disaster that struck first with an earthquake and next with a devastating tsunami. The power stations shut down automatically when Friday's earthquake rocked the region, but emergency generators crucial for cooling the reactors were knocked out in the following tsunami. Waiting until Sunday before filling two of the reactors with seawater has been criticised as a potentially serious delay. An anti-nuclear group in Japan said the danger should have been foreseen. \"A disaster that promoters of nuclear power said wouldn't happen is in progress,\" said Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre. \"It is occurring as a result of an earthquake that they said would not happen.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/01/david-cameron-ef-schumacher-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T17:01:35Z","webTitle":"Does David Cameron really follow this green guru? | Andrew Simms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/01/david-cameron-ef-schumacher-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/01/david-cameron-ef-schumacher-environment","fields":{"headline":"Does David Cameron really follow this green guru?","bodyText":"It was a surprise to read in the Observer that the late economist EF Schumacher, author of the seminal 1973 book Small is Beautiful, was not only back in fashion, but apparently also a guru for those within Downing Street. For many, myself included, Schumacher never went out of fashion. His ideas inform several prominent organisations and movements active in creating better, more climate-friendly food and energy systems. His understanding that the economy must know its junior place next to the biosphere, dependent not dominant, has gained influence over decades. It's a paradigm-shifting insight with profound implications for economics and other disciplines. Which is why, leaving aside a little political mood music, it is hard to believe that he is a guru to the current government. The coalition is rushing to restore a very old-style deregulated market economy, where finance comes first and making it easier for the already rich to get richer is meant to benefit all. Schumacher's impressive eyebrows would have shot skyward at this thought, so very far from his \"economics as if people mattered\". Similarly, he would have been horrified to see the proceeds of taxing big oil companies, being used to subsidise consumption of their product, oil, a nonrenewable resource. He would also have dismissed Downing Street's enthusiasm for nuclear power and other big, centralised, capital intensive technologies that lack human scale, or fight against nature rather than co-operate with it. Schumacher was full of ideas on rethinking both work itself and the places where we do it. He advocated \"trusteeship\" as a radical form of economic governance, something also directly applicable to our management of natural resources. In particular he praised the model adopted by a manufacturing company called Scott Bader Commonwealth that still operates successfully today. Once it was a conventionally run, profit-maximising business. Now it has no shareholders and the maximum differential between highest and lowest paid is 1:7. A democratic members assembly made up of staff committed to the firms ethos holds the board to account, in line with their founding principles. The company is immune to takeover and has long-term planning horizons. Sixty per cent of profits are reinvested and each generation at the company is obliged to work to ensure the long-term sustainability of the firm, in order that future generations may benefit. Godric Bader, descended from the firm's founder, says this has \"a direct parallel as to how we now urgently have to look at our earthly home\". Schumacher thought the key to success was developing \"responsibility for a bundle of assets – not ownership\". The approach, he wrote, overcame \"the reductionism of the private ownership system and uses industrial organisations as a servant of man, instead of allowing it to use men simply as means to the enrichment of the owners of capital\". The current rush to re-privatise Britain's bailed-out banks and privatise afresh everything from the blood donation service to, well, almost everything, would have left Schumacher exercising the most vividly colourful corners of his vocabulary. The transformation of ownership into a sense of long-term trusteeship over common assets, rather than its mere changing of hands from company founder to workers was, he thought a \"necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the achievement of higher aims\". Explicit tasks that are useful in economic, but also social and environmental ways, need to be written into the principles of \"commonwealth\". News that the UK's greenhouse gas emissions rose by nearly 3% last year would have presented Schumacher with just such an explicit task. For the UK to play its part in preventing dangerous climate-change emissions, cuts of around 10% per year are needed. Just as the 10:10 campaign is trying to do, Schumacher would have written this goal into the principles of commonwealth in such a way that it became an economic purpose of the company to achieve it. Ironically, the title that helped make the book successful, Small is Beautiful, was forced on to a reluctant Schumacher by his publisher Anthony Blond. Schumacher didn't think everything should be small, but of an appropriate scale. But he thought: \"There is wisdom in smallness if only on account of the smallness and patchiness of human knowledge, which relies on experiment far more than on understanding. The greatest danger invariably arises from the ruthless application, on a vast scale, of partial knowledge such as we are currently witnessing in the application of nuclear energy, of the new chemistry in agriculture, of transportation technology, and countless other things.\" \"Ruthless application on a vast scale\" accurately describes the current government's programme of cuts, and the use of a narrow, failed and discredited version of market economics. If that message creeps from the pages of the copies of Small is Beautiful allegedly to be found in Downing Street, the guru can take a bow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/13/japan-crisis-worst-since-second-world-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T16:59:00Z","webTitle":"Earthquake and tsunami 'Japan's worst crisis since second world war'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-crisis-worst-since-second-world-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-crisis-worst-since-second-world-war","fields":{"headline":"Earthquake and tsunami 'Japan's worst crisis since second world war'","bodyText":"Japan is facing its biggest crisis since the second world war, the prime minister Naoto Kan has said, as the country battled to avert a nuclear disaster after the devastasting earthquake and tsunami. Police have warned that the death toll could rise to 10,000 in one prefecture alone and national broadcaster NHK reported that more than 1,100 people were now confirmed dead. Most are thought to have drowned. Authorities were fighting to keep temperatures down in multiple reactors at two plants in Fukushima prefecture, warning that a partial meltdown was possible in one and that there was a risk of a second hydrogen explosion in another. Neither would necessarily breach the reactor's containment vessel, and authorities played down the likelihood of a substantial release of radiation. As many as 190 people had already been exposed, a Japanese official told Reuters, with 22 confirmed to have suffered contamination. \"The earthquake, tsunami and the nuclear incident have been the biggest crisis Japan has encountered in the 65 years since the end of world war two,\" Kan told a news conference. \"We're under scrutiny on whether we, the Japanese people, can overcome this crisis.\" Friday's 8.9 magnitude earthquake - the worst in Japan's recorded history and the fifth worst worldwide in the last century - caused a tsunami up to 10 metres high. As aftershocks continued to shake the north-east region, the Japanese meteorological agency warned that there was a 70% possibility of a magnitude seven or greater tremor in the next three days. There was some relief for the battered coast as the agency lifted the tsunami warning, although it said aftershocks could cause further waves. Tokyo has doubled the number of troops in its rescue and relief team to 100,000, but damage to roads and bridges has hampered their efforts. Survivors in the disaster zone huddled in public shelters for a third night in near freezing temperatures. About 300,000 people have been displaced or evacuated due to the tsunami and radiation fears. At least 10,000 people were feared killed by the earthquake in Miyagi prefecture alone, its police chief told NHK. The broadcaster said 550 people were confirmed dead there, 335 in Iwate and 285 in Fukushima. With phone services still down in many areas, survivors made their way to civic centres to check boards with names of others known to have survived and those who had died. Etsuko Oyama, who was rescued by a neighbour after the wave swept her 400 metres from her home, struggled to hold back tears as she spoke to NHK. \"I grabbed my daughter's hand but I lost my grip when I was swept away by the debris and water,\" she said. \"I managed to survive but my daughter was washed away ... I hope she is still alive somewhere.\" There were welcome moments of celebration as survivors were reunited, but no good news was unalloyed by grief. Japanese troops rescued a 60-year-old man found 10 miles out to sea on the roof of his home. But Hiromitsu Shinkawa said his wife had been swept away when the tsunami hit as they returned home to gather possessions after the quake. International relief teams from countries including China, the US and the UK are arriving to help Japanese troops. Almost 70 countries have offered anything from sending nuclear experts and sniffer dog squads to shipping in food and blankets. Donors included the city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. \"I know $50,000 is not a lot of money for a country like Japan, but it is a show of appreciation from the Kandahar people,\" mayor Ghulam Haidar Hamidi told Reuters. News agency Kyodo reported that more than 20,000 buildings nationwide were either destroyed or badly damaged. Some 2 million households were without power, and 1.4 million without drinking water, Japan's ministry of health, labour and welfare said - although electricity was restored to some parts of Sendai city. Power generation has fallen sharply due to the closure of nuclear plants and officials have ordered rolling three-hour blackouts across Tokyo and the surrounding area from tomorrow. Demand is substantially higher during the week than at weekends. \"We have to avoid at all costs a sudden power shortage whose scale could have devastating consequences for the economy and people's lives,\" Kan told a press conference. NHK reported that the blackouts could last until the end of next month. The nuclear crisis has prompted many to reassess the use of nuclear power in other parts of the world. Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, said he had asked British regulators to study the Japanese situation to \"learn any lessons\" for UK power stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/feb/22/bradwell-oldbury-reactors-opposition","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-22T21:12:10Z","webTitle":"Bradwell and Oldbury reactors face opposition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/22/bradwell-oldbury-reactors-opposition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/feb/22/bradwell-oldbury-reactors-opposition","fields":{"headline":"Bradwell and Oldbury reactors face opposition","bodyText":"Local councils have opposed two of the 10 proposed new nuclear reactor sites in England and Wales, accusing the government of trying to railroad them through under its new planning regime. The councils will make the first challenge to the controversial new Infrastructure Planning Commission, which was established to speed up the planning process for large projects and starts handling planning applications next month. Bob Neill, shadow minister for planning, told the Guardian the government's national policy statements, which shape the IPC's decisions on questions such as the proposed reactor sites, amounted to a \"diktat\". The Conservatives have pledged to abolish the planning quango. The government closed its consultation on the planning statements yesterday. In its submission, South Gloucestershire council, which is opposing the planned E.ON and RWE reactor at Oldbury, said the risk of flooding had been underestimated. It also said councils did not have the resources to fully assess the applications for nuclear companies. It added: \"The draft [national planning statement] effectively confers a presumption in favour of development.\" The Guardian has also learned that Colchester borough council and West Mersea town council are objecting to the nomination of Bradwell, which is owned by EDF, as a new reactor site. Essex county council has yet to make a decision. Professor Andy Blowers, a former government adviser on nuclear waste, said: \"What is the point of the IPC or any consultation if you are going to have the nomination rammed down your throat?\" A planning officer involved said: \"I do not believe either the energy companies or the government have engaged with the general public that are the most affected by new energy infrastructure as much as they could. There is a moral duty to provide a more personal and embracing form of engagement.\" The objections of the local authorities are unlikely to block the nominations, but they underline the strength of feeling against the new planning regime. The IPC rather than the government will have the final say on any large infrastructure project, and it is guided by national rather than local considerations. Under the Conservatives, the secretary of state would make the decision. The party claims this is more democratic. \"Labour's national policy statements will not be ratified by parliament, but merely issued by diktat of the secretary of state,\" Neill said. \"Our proposals will strengthen the role of parliament and ensure a vital democratic check and balance on controversial matters of national energy policy.\" A government spokesman insisted that the IPC would take into account local objections. \"The new system will be faster and fairer with fuller public scrutiny. \"Local authorities will set out the effects of proposed infrastructure on the local area, and people will be able to make their case at every stage of the application and decision making process and speak at open-floor hearings.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2011/jan/07/students-opt-out-academic-education-14","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-07T13:30:00Z","webTitle":"Students could end academic education at 14 under coalition plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/07/students-opt-out-academic-education-14","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2011/jan/07/students-opt-out-academic-education-14","fields":{"headline":"Students could end academic education at 14 under coalition plans","bodyText":"Students will be able to leave academic education at 14 in favour of vocational training at specialist colleges under coalition plans.

Baker said the schools were not a small experiment but a movement designed to tackle a shortage of young people with vocational skills. \"If we are going to have high-speed rail, the fastest broadband in the world, new nuclear power stations, we are going to need technicians,\" he told the Times. \"We simply don't have enough technically orientated people coming through.\" Critics fear it would create a two-tier system, with less able students at risk of being pushed into vocational courses and pupils forced to make important decisions about their future at too young an age. Christine Blower, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"It is not acceptable that at the age of 14 pupils may be forced into specific learning routes which could restrict their future education or career choices. Attempting to separate technical or vocational education from mainstream schools is socially divisive and will lead to a two-tier system with technical schools being seen as the poor cousin. \"The government needs to revisit the proposals put forward by Tomlinson and the NUT which call for a single overarching qualification that embraces all young people and does not label them as one thing or another at such a young age.\" Baker insisted that 14 was a reasonable age to make choices about a career path. \"Eleven is too soon to choose that, 16 is too late; 14 is the right age of transfer,\" he said. The coalition has pledged to open technical schools, with links to employers, in at least 12 cities across the country. Plans were under way for five to open by next autumn, and between 12 and 20 by September next year, Baker said. One, sponsored by the plant machinery company JCB, had already opened in Staffordshire. Areas in which colleges are planned include Walsall, Hackney, Southwark, central Bedfordshire, Luton, Norwich, Wigan, Sheffield, Warrington, Daventry and Knowsley. By 2013 all pupils in England will have to stay in education or training until the end of the school year in which they turn 17. By 2015 they will have to stay on until they are 18. Baker's plans come after the former education secretary Estelle Morris said thousands more pupils would stay in school past the age of 16 if they took GCSEs at 14, with those more suited to practical courses starting to study them at that point. They would be less likely to drop out of school or college, Morris told the North of England education conference in Blackpool yesterday. The Labour peer, who was a teacher herself, joins a growing number of educationalists calling for GCSEs at 16 to be abolished. In November Professor Alan Smithers, the director of Buckingham University's centre for education and employment research, argued in a paper for the Sutton Trust that taking the exams at 14 and then choosing between academic, vocational or technical training routes would give pupils a better chance of a good job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-miyagi-tsunami-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-11T09:11:00Z","webTitle":"Powerful earthquakes hit Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-miyagi-tsunami-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-miyagi-tsunami-warning","fields":{"headline":"Powerful earthquakes hit Japan","bodyText":"A series of massive earthquakes have struck north-east Japan, unleashing a 10-metre tsunami that swept buildings, vehicles, crops and debris across swaths of farmland. The first 8.9 magnitude shock is said to be the biggest to have hit Japan in 140 years, rocking buildings 235 miles (380km) away in Tokyo and sparking fires. At least five people are known to have died, but amid widespread reports of landslides, floods, collapsed buildings and fires, the death toll is expected to rise. The quake hit at 2.46pm (5.45am GMT), about 6 miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast. It was swiftly followed by five powerful aftershocks of up to 7.1 magnitude. In Tokyo people screamed and grabbed each other's hands as the quake struck. The shock was so powerful it was felt as far away as Beijing. Television footage showed a 4-metre tsunami sweeping over embankments in Sendai city, bearing cars and houses – some on fire – across farmland, before reversing course and carrying them out to sea. Public broadcaster NHK showed images of a large ship ramming into a breakwater in Kennuma city, Miyagi prefecture. The quake and tsunami halted air and rail services across large parts of the country. Eight military planes were scrambled to survey the damage as areas along Japan's entire Pacific coast braced for aftershocks and the possibility of more tsunami. The Pacific tsunami warning centre in Hawaii said a warning was in effect for Japan, Russia, Marcus Island and the Northern Marianas. Tsunami watches have been issued for Guam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii and the entire western coast of the US and Canada, from the Mexican border to Chignik Bay in Alaska. The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, promised a quick response as he called an emergency cabinet meeting. \"The earthquake has caused major damage in broad areas in northern Japan,\" Kan said during an emergency news conference. \"Some of the nuclear power plant in the region have automatically shut down, but there is no leakage of radioactive materials to the environment.\" The shutdown left 4m homes in and around Tokyo without power. Kan said he had set up an emergency taskforce to co-ordinate the rescue effort. \"The government will make an all-out effort to ensure the safety of all the people and contain the damage to the minimum,\" he said. Junichi Sawada, an official with Japan's fire and disaster management agency, said: \"This is a rare, major quake, and damages could quickly rise by the minute.\" Fire department officials in Osaki, Miyagi prefecture, said at least 20 people had been injured by falling objects, with some reportedly trapped under debris. At least 10 people were injured when part of a hall roof collapsed in Tokyo, the metropolitan police department said. All flights were grounded immediately after the quake while officials checked for runway damage. Strong tremors were felt in Tokyo about 30 minutes after the quake. Newsreaders in the capital wore helmets as they gave updates, while office workers rushed out of buildings and on to the streets for safety. Osamu Akiya, 46, was working at his Tokyo office when the quake hit, sending bookshelves and other items flying and opening up cracks in the wall. \"I've been through many earthquakes, but I've never felt anything like this,\" he said. \"I don't know if we'll be able to get home tonight.\" Television footage showed a building on fire in the Odaiba district of Tokyo, although it was not immediately clear if the blaze was connected to the earthquake. Another fire was seen burning out of control at the at Cosmo oil refinery in Ichihara, in Chiba prefecture near Tokyo. Water levels rose quickly in the coastal town of Miyako in Iwate prefecture, while vehicles, houses and buildings were swept away by the tsunami in Onahama city, Fukushima prefecture. TV news presenters repeatedly warned people along the Pacific coast to head for higher ground. The quake is one of several to have struck north-east Japan this week, including one of magnitude 7.3 on Wednesday. In 1933, a magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 3,000 people. Last year fishing facilities were damaged by a tsunami caused by a strong quake in Chile. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, accounting for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/29/japan-nuclear-plant-us-robots","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T19:04:48Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear plant gets help from US robots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-nuclear-plant-us-robots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-nuclear-plant-us-robots","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear plant gets help from US robots","bodyText":"The Obama administration is sending a squad of robots to Japan to help efforts to regain control over the Fukushima nuclear plant, it has emerged. \"A shipment is being readied,\" Peter Lyons, who oversees nuclear power in the department of energy, told a Senate committee. \"The government of Japan is very, very interested in the capabilities that could be brought to bear from this country.\" The news came amid growing fears about the status of the plant's No2 reactor, one of three which workers have been pumping water into in an effort to keep the fuel rods from melting down. Richard Lahey, who worked as a safety research officer at General Electric when it installed the plant's units, said part of the molten core seemed to have sunk through the steel 'lower head' of the pressure vessel and on to the concrete floor below. Officials seemed to have \"lost the race\" to save the reactor, said Lahey, a professor at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the US, who based his conclusion on analysis of radiation levels. The Japanese government said yesterday that it was considering nationalising the operator of the crippled power plant at the centre of the worst nuclear accident in the country's history, amid mounting criticism of its handling of the crisis. \"Our preparedness was not sufficient,\" government spokesman Yukio Edano said. He said that when the current crisis was over they would examine the accident closely and thoroughly review safety standards. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, fought off criticism of his role, insisting to MPs that a state of \"maximum alert\" would be maintained until the power plant had been made safe. According to Lyons, engineers were making progress in resolving the emergency at Fukushima. \"Current information suggests the plants are in a slow recovery from the accident,\" he told senators in Washington. But he and Bill Borchardt, director of operations for the US nuclear regulatory commission, would not predict when the crisis might be over. \"I really can't even hazard a guess on how long that will be,\" Borchardt said. The advantage of deploying robots at Fukushima was underlined last week when two workers were exposed to high levels of radiation and burned. The workers were standing in pools of extremely radioactive water in a reactor turbine room without adequate protective gear. Robots, with electronics built to withstand radiation, can work in areas of Fukushima where radiation levels would soon kill a human engineer. They can also help experts get a view on damage to the reactor core. Lyons said the robots would be equipped with cameras as well as devices to measure radiation. \"They could go places where you certainly wouldn't send a person,\" he said. The department of energy has developed a number of remotely operated robots designed to clear up radioactive waste from department of energy test weapons sites, Lyons said. The earliest versions were developed in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 when robots were sent in to get a view of the damaged reactor, and to suck up radioactive water and partially melted fuel. In addition to the robots, which will be accompanied by trainers to instruct Japanese workers in their operation, the department of energy earlier sent nearly 40 people and almost 8 tonnes of equipment, including devices that measure radiation from aircraft. Lyons said US flights were only going within 2.5 miles of the plant, because of the elevated radiation levels. News that the Japanese government could take a majority stake in the Tokyo Electric Power company (Tepco) came as the government admitted that its nuclear safety standards had been insufficient to protect the plant against the 11 March tsunami. Authorities vowed to overhaul regulations once the radiation leak is under control. The struggle to contain radiation at the complex has been hit by near-daily mistakes, including two workers being drenched with radioactive water on Tuesday despite wearing supposedly waterproof suits. Doubts over the future of Tepco, the largest power company in Asia, has coincided with anger towards its president, Masataka Shimizu, who has not been seen in public for several days. Tepco officials said Shimizu, 66, had been ill, but said he had resumed work directing emergency operations at the company's headquarters in Tokyo. Shimizu has not appeared before the media since 13 March; for six days from 16 March, as his employees battled to prevent stricken reactors from going into full meltdown, he reportedly did not attend crisis meetings or visit Tepco's HQ. On 15 March Shimizu was on the receiving end of an outburst from Kan, who said the firm had been too slow to inform him of an explosion at the plant. Reporters overheard Kan demanding of Shimizu and other Tepco executives: \"What the hell is going on?\" Japan's government is likely to compile a first emergency budget of 2tn yen (£15.2bn) for disaster relief and will aim to submit it to parliament in April, the Nikkei newspaper reported this morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/jun/04/energy-bill-amendment-climate-goals","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-04T17:10:15Z","webTitle":"Can the UK meet its climate goals without the energy bill amendment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jun/04/energy-bill-amendment-climate-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/jun/04/energy-bill-amendment-climate-goals","fields":{"headline":"Can the UK meet its climate goals without the energy bill amendment?","bodyText":"Hampered by the messy, murky internal politics of coalition government, it was always going to be a long shot for Tim Yeo and Barry Gardiner to secure victory today in their proposed decarbonisation amendment to the energy bill. That they were only narrowly defeated is a victory of sorts, given the odds against them. In fact, they ended up forcing one of the narrowest victories for the government in a whipped vote during this parliament. But the cold reality is that the energy bill moves forward to the upper house without a firm commitment to ensuring the UK's electricity is generated with next-to-no carbon emissions by 2030. That will clearly make it even harder for the nation to meet its legal-binding 80% reduction target by 2050. The nation is fast running out of wiggle room. This government clearly likes to gamble. It is gambling that its beloved \"dash for gas\" will have its emissions abated in the mid-term with as-yet-unproven carbon capture and storage technology. It is gambling that, as a result of fracking, gas prices will be lower than they are today in the decades ahead. Similarly, it is gambling that the \"whole life costs\" of nuclear power will be kept to a minimum in the decades ahead. It is gambling that gas will only replace coal and not, in addition, stifle investment in low-carbon energy sources, thereby potentially undoing the gains any coal-to-gas transition achieves in terms of net emissions reductions. With the stakes so high, the government appears to favour high-risk bets on the future as opposed to guaranteeing a more risk-free landscape for those seeking to invest in next-generation, low-carbon power supplies. As a result, the odds of meeting our 2050 climate targets, let alone any early commitments, appear to have lengthened today. Fiona Harvey's news story is now live on the Guardian website: Several potential rebels, including the Lib Dem president Tim Farron, were persuaded by a promise by the coalition to allow the secretary of state to consider a 2030 decarbonisation target in 2016. But before then, the government will review the fourth carbon budget, which sets out how much carbon dioxide the UK can produce each year to 2027. David Cameron, under pressure from greens, agreed early in the coalition to set a stiff carbon budget that would require roughly halving the UK's carbon output by the late 2020s. However, he bowed to George Osborne, the chancellor, who opposes green regulation, in allowing a review of that target next year, in 2014. The fight over the fourth carbon budget looks set to be intense, as the close nature of Tuesday's vote shows. Many Tories back Osborne's call for a new \"dash for gas\", which they say will be cheaper than renewable power, and are concerned that the UK is taking on more than its share of emissions cuts. The Committee on Climate Change recently produced a report rebutting those arguments, and showing that the UK could benefit from cheaper energy if more renewable generation is built sooner rather than later. More reaction to the vote... Prof Tim Dixon, chair in sustainable futures in the built environment at the University of Reading’s School of Construction Management and Engineering:The omission of a clear decarbonisation target for energy supply from the energy bill will create even greater uncertainty over the UK meeting its longer term 2050 carbon emissions targets and space for a sustainable and diverse array of energy sources to plug the gaps. Energy policy needs to be reconnected with energy efficiency measures in an integrated way, and within a coherent low carbon strategy to create greater certainty for investors. Much of the expected energy efficiency take-up measures are tied into a successful implementation of the green deal, and this will require further incentivisation and reconfiguration if it is to succeed. A binding decarbonisation target for 2030 should be introduced in line with the Committee on Climate Change recommendations, and this should be part of a strategic approach to a Low Carbon UK economy by 2050. Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change: If we are serious about tackling spiralling energy bills, improving our country’s energy security and stopping dangerous climate change, Britain must decarbonise its power sector. The government’s failure to back a decarbonisation target will leave households vulnerable to completely unnecessary increases to their energy bills and cause Britain to miss out on vital new clean energy jobs. The transition to a low-carbon economy has the potential to be a major source of growth and prosperity, but the government’s failure to back a decarbonisation target means businesses will choose to invest and create jobs elsewhere. This is a humiliating failure by the Liberal Democrats and a betrayal of David Cameron’s promise to be the greenest government ever. Dr Alison Doig, Christian Aid’s senior climate Change adviser: By voting to omit a decarbonisation target for our electricity sector MPs have increased confusion for the industry, destabilised investment across our energy sector and put into question the government’s commitment to the UK’s climate change target. There are no winners, just continued uncertainty. Christian Aid is part of a wide coalition of 55 organisations, including major trade associations, industry, investors, church groups and NGOs calling for MPs to act to put the UK on track to become a world leading low-carbon economy. We believe this is too important to give up on. There is time for this decision to be put right and for clear signals to industry to be put in place. The impacts of climate change and our unsustainable thirst for fossil fuels is already threatening some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people through increasing drought, floods and climate disasters. John Alker, director of policy and communications at the UK Green Building Council: There was a remarkable degree of consensus, from both private sector and NGOs, about the importance of a decarbonisation target in the bill. Some coalition MPs chose to listen to the evidence and stand up and be counted this afternoon – sadly, not quite enough. The real danger is that this sends another signal to business that government isn’t serious enough about the future direction of travel on carbon, when progressive businesses are crying out for political leadership and policy certainty. On a more positive note, it’s encouraging to see energy demand reduction getting the attention it deserves. There is still an enormous, and largely untapped potential to reduce energy use cost-effectively across the entire UK building stock, not only reducing pressure on new generating capacity, but getting the construction industry moving again. Reaction to the vote already starting to arrive... Andy Atkins, Friends of the Earth’s executive director: The Liberal Democrat leadership’s green credibility has been left in tatters after siding with the Conservatives to back a headlong dash for gas – this would send fuel bills rocketing and jobs overseas, and punch a gaping hole in our climate targets. With significant numbers of MPs defying the party whip to join the Opposition by voting for clean power, this issue will not go away. The fight now moves to the Lords, where peers from all parties, cross benchers and bishops are expected to back power sector decarbonisation, because they know it’s essential for safeguarding our economy and environment. Elizabeth Ziga of Fuel Poverty Action: In failing to set a target on clean energy, the government has yet again let down hard-up UK households. The government's own advisers have shown that a clean power target could have saved households up to £1,600 on our bills. Instead, the door has been opened for a new generation of gas power stations, which will mean sky-rocketing fuel bills and more extreme weather due to climate change. The time has come for civil disobedience and direct action - the fight for a clean, cheap energy future isn't over James Murray, BusinessGreen: The move will be seen as a major blow to green businesses, many of which have argued that a decarbonisation target would help to mobilise billions of pounds of investment in the clean energy supply chain... The relatively close nature of the vote means attention will now turn to the Lords where green campaigners are confident the amendment could still pass. Lib Dem and Conservative peers have shown themselves to be more rebellious than their Commons colleagues in recent years, while a number of bishops and cross bench peers are expected to support the adoption of a decarbonisation target. \"The House of Lords has been very rebellious of late,\" observed one green campaigner. \"There was always a greater chance of the amendment passing in the Lords than the Commons.\" If the amendment is adopted by the House of Lords it is likely to result in the bill being shuttled back and forth between the two houses, requiring the government to make some form of concession in the bill or, in extreme circumstances, force the legislation through using the Parliament Act. However, if it is defeated for again in the Lords the focus will shift towards whether the government can deliver on its promise that the other main elements of the energy bill - the contract for difference support scheme, capacity mechanism, and emissions performance standard - will mobilise an estimated £110bn of clean energy investment by 2020. Gaynor Hartnell, Renewable Energy Association's chief executive: Today’s vote is disappointing. It makes an EU-level renewables target for 2030 even more important, something the ‘greenest government ever’ is also opposing in Europe. Failing to decarbonise our electricity supply industry will have long term consequences both environmentally and economically. The government’s own advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, state that relying on gas will only save the country money in a scenario of low gas prices, whereas switching to renewables would save the country £25bn-45bn by the 2020s. Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK: It’s really disappointing that the decarbonisation target was rejected so narrowly. However with the government scraping by with only 23 votes, MPs from all parties have sent a powerful signal that they are not convinced that the coalition’s crude compromise is best for Britain. This issue is sure to return in the House of Lords where parliament will have another opportunity to put it right. The coalition’s mixed messages have undermined confidence in the low carbon energy market and sent damaging signals about the UK’s commitment to our legally binding climate goals. Debate has centred on the decarbonisation target – which would give a much-needed boost to investor confidence – but the mixed messages about the gas strategy, the fourth carbon budget, and the hype around shale gas are also cause for concern. Making a decisive call now to move towards a low-carbon power sector would prevent delaying investments in the low-carbon projects we urgently need to keep the lights on and reduce our emissions. It would also help trigger long-term investments in developing a UK supply chain that will help reduce the costs of the new low-carbon technologies like offshore wind and CCS and boost economic growth. Tim Yeo's amendment has been defeated - more narrowly than was predicted. The government majority was only 23. There was 267 Ayes supporting the amendment and 290 Noes. Yeo has just put out this statement: The Commons has missed an opportunity today to provide more clarity for investors on the future direction of energy policy. Unfortunately this could mean that urgently needed investment in our energy infrastructure will be slower and the risk of a capacity crisis greater.” The continuing uncertainty that will result increases the perceived risk of investment and will therefore raise capital costs, meaning that consumers may ultimately pay more for the new power plants that need to be built.” Perhaps more worryingly, failure to introduce a clean energy target now could make it harder for the UK to meet its long-term carbon reduction targets, forcing future governments to take more costly action to curb emissions later when the impacts of a changing climate become more acute. Fortunately, the House of Lords still has a chance to amend the energy bill to ensure the government takes the advice of its statutory independent climate advisors for decarbonising the electricity generation industry. I urge my colleagues in the other House to continue the fight. Following the question earlier about whether the UK was on course to meet its carbon target for 2020, I have received this email from Roger Pielke Jr, professor of environmental studies at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado at Boulder: I have looked at updated decarbonization data for the UK using data from: 1) on GDP from ONS (in 2009 values): http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-284969 2) On CO2 emissions from DECC: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/provisional-uk-emissions-estimates Here is what I have found, building upon the peer-reviewed paper I did in 2009 here: http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/4/2/024010/fulltext/ [Note that because I am using different data sources, the numbers I present below a a bit of apples and oranges as compared to the numbers in the paper - so caution is urged in any direct comparison.] Since the Climate Change Act was passed in 2008 (so from 2009 to 2012), the UK economy decarbonized (that is, the rate of reduction in CO2/GDP, a necessary condition for emissions reductions when GDP is constant or growing) at a rate of 1.1% per year. CO2 emissions changed little, going from 480.7 MMT (million metric tonnes) in 2009 to 479.1 MMT in 2012. Over that same period GDP increased by 3.1% (but remains below 2007 values). From 2011 to 2012 CO2 emissions actually increased by 4.5%, In order to achieve the goal of a 34% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2022 as specified in the CC Act will require a rate of decarbonization of 3.0% per year (assuming a 1% annual rate of GDP growth) to a rate of 4.9% per year (assuming a 3% rate of GDP growth). Such rates have not been achieved historically over such a long period and imply a substantial acceleration of recent decarbonization (i.e., since the passage of the CC Act) by ~3-5 times as compared to recent years. Decarbonization of the UK economy has actually slowed significantly since the passage of the CCA (it was ~3% per year in the 3 years prior to the passage of the Act). In short, it seems that the provisions of the UK Climate Change Act can only be met by non-CO2 accounting measures, such as the use of offsets or accounting of non-CO2 GHGs/land use or perhaps other mechanisms of accounting (I note that DECC's official projections are based on erroneous assumptions about the price of oil, the price of EU ETS allowances and exchange rates, suggesting that even accounting mechanisms may not be enough to hide the failure of the UK economy to decarbonize at a rate necessary to hit a 34% reduction target). Such measures may (or may not) fulfill the statutory legal requirements. However, it seems clear that at present -- at least with respect to carbon dioxide -- the UK is not on track to meet emissions reduction targets. Assumptions of rapid increases in decarbonization yet to come remain exactly that until actions are taken and evidence shows such acceleration. In short, the analysis and conclusions that I presented in my 2009 paper remain solid. With respect to carbon dioxide, under positive economic growth it will be very difficult and likely impossible for the UK to meet its mandated targets for emissions reductions. Accounting mechanisms can help with perceptions, but will not alter the underlying dynamics. I have asked Pielke to expand on what he means by Decc's \"erroneous assumptions\". I will post any answer I receive here. UPDATE: Pielke has just emailed me this: *ETS carbon price assumed currently to be 7.2 Euros and rising, presently about half that *Oil price assumed to be &gt;$115, currently about $100 How much will these matter? Not clear, but as assumptions that go into the analysis they are clearly off by a significant amount. The European edition of the Wall Street Journal, in an editorial headlined, \"Britain's No-Energy Bill\", says \"Cameron government puts 'decarbonization' above growth\": The UK's 2013 energy bill is up for a key vote Tuesday, and even the best-case outcome is likely to hurt an already weak British economy. Three years into David Cameron's five-year term as prime minister, growth is at a standstill, government deficits remain stubbornly high, and Mr Cameron's Conservatives are on track for a stinging defeat at the polls. Yet Mr Cameron and his Liberal Democrat coalition partners seem intent on pursuing the economic folly of total \"decarbonization\" of the British economy. Voters could be forgiven if they haven't noticed how crazy this policy is. Friends of the Earth took out an ad in yesterday's Times arguing that if MPs didn't vote for the amendment \"we risk losing these clean energy industries to countries like Germany\"... Natan Doron, a senior researcher at the Fabian Society, has posted this article on the thinktank's website: Politicians of all parties should certainly be supporting a target to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. There is a long list of reasons for doing so – these include emissions targets but also a chance to support a key and growing sector in our economy. But the simple fact is that targets create clarity. They signal where a government wants to go. They provide direction for public, private and third sector actors working in different industries and services... This energy bill should have been a time to focus on implementation. The details on contracts for difference, the levy control framework and the capacity mechanism will have a huge impact on how we can get the best investment to fund our low-carbon transition. But David Cameron’s lack of leadership means that we are now debating a target. The focus is on our political will to tackle climate change, not the necessarily technical and complicated detail of how. As Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, sits in the Commons for the energy bill debate, he has also released a written ministerial statement on the UK's negotiating position on the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Framework: We strongly support EU action to tackle climate change and to help deliver the EU’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees. We remain committed to an increase in the EU climate target for 2020 to 30% and are pushing strongly for urgent structural reform of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to ensure it continues to incentivise investment in low carbon. We must celebrate the success of the 2020 Climate and Energy Package. By 2011 EU emissions were already down 17.6% on 1990 levels (Reference: European Environment Agency). But we should also learn the lessons from 2008 package - the EU climate deal for 2020 was not sufficiently ambitious, and the renewables target was the product of a time when renewables badly needed a catalyst. The EU has moved on since then; we need to see a new deal on greenhouse gas targets that is ambitious, but which has flexibility to let countries follow their most cost effective decarbonisation approach. Looking to 2030, the EU should adopt a unilateral EU target for 2030 of a 40% reduction on 1990 levels. In the context of an ambitious global climate agreement for the period beyond 2020, the EU’s target should increase to up to a 50% reduction on 1990 levels. Carbon Brief's Mat Hope is currently live-tweeting the energy bill debate in the Commons. Carbon Brief has produced a Storify of his tweets. Here's a selection of tweets from other interested observers... Leonie Greene, head of external affairs at Renewable Energy Association and Solar Trade Association, has concerns about the ability of independent renewable power generators to sell their power at a \"decent price\" under the contract-for-difference (CfD) model proposed in the energy bill: Parliament must today recognise how vital independent generators are to securing the massive renewable power generation investment the UK needs. Nearly all solar schemes are independent, but there is potentially a serious problem for independent generators securing a decent price for their electricity under the CfD proposals. DECC recognise this, so we are on tenterhooks today to hear how they propose to tackle this. What we need is a solution that the solar industry and investors can have real confidence in, and quickly. The UK solar industry installed over 0.5GW of solar in first three months of this year. Solar has demonstrated the fastest cost reduction of all technologies so we are confident, with the right energy bill framework, solar will make a massive contribution to delivering clean energy for the UK, and cost-effectively. Solar also opens up the electricity sector to everyday ownership by businesses, local government and communities. It really is power to the people, so parliament should be right behind us. Labour's Barry Gardiner, co-sponsor of the amendment, has now taken to the floor. Here's a short extract of his speech: The Lib Dems have not learned the Lady Bracknell rule of politics – to break one pledge may be regarded as a misfortune; to break two looks like contempt for the electorate...The secretary of state calls it his Grand Bargain with the chancellor. It is more like a Faustian pact. Old coal will be allowed to provide baseload beyond 2023, gas will be encouraged to provide baseload up until 2045 and the UK will lose the jobs and growth in low carbon technologies that we need for economic renewal. Not since Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage has a worse deal been struck. Tim Yeo is now introducing his amendment in the Commons. Here is a draft of the speech... Simon Moore, a research fellow at Policy Exchange, a right-leaning thinktank, has sent me this: Evidence of the supposed cost-effectiveness of the 50g target is based on highly speculative assumptions about the costs of different energy technologies in 2030, and in the assumed inability of a market to reduce its use of gas if faced with high gas and/or carbon prices. The assertion that it could save money compared with an alternative relies on the idea that a team of civil servants can consistently beat the market over a period of almost two decades, which, if true, might lead these people to stop being civil servants and make some money with their incredible powers of foresight. A second argument made in favour of the target, that it will improve confidence among investors in low-carbon technologies, is even less persuasive. These investors are already being given a huge chunk of their longed-for certainty. First, they have the Climate Change Act which gives those legally binding 2050 commitments, which no other country has matched. Secondly, the energy bill itself is going to provide low carbon generators with decades-long guaranteed prices. Thirdly, the treasury has agreed to provide around £9bn of support for low carbon generation in 2020 or, more accurately, it has made the commitment on behalf of electricity billpayers as these tariffs will be collected through bills. How much more certainty do they need? Do the amendment’s backers really think that an airy commitment to electricity decarbonisation will entice investors presently unconvinced by the impending cash bonanza? A more useful debate is whether the target is necessary to meet carbon budgets and the 2050 carbon target established in the Climate Change Act, and whether, even if it costs more than not trying to get it done by 2030, it is still worth doing. This argument can be narrowed down considerably. Emissions from the electricity generation sector are covered by the EU’s Emissions Trading System. While that remains in force, any savings from the UK electricity system the cap might create would be cancelled out by higher emissions elsewhere in Europe. The only place that genuine savings are plausible is in parts of the economy not presently covered by the ETS (such as transport and heating). If the only plausible way to decarbonise these is through electrification (which is a big if) then a less carbon-intensive electricity system will help with that. However, a more expensive electricity system will hinder that, which is another reason to be cautious about the proclaimed benefits of the target. Earlier this week, the former energy minister Charles Hendry wrote a comment piece for Conservative Home entitled, \"Why we shouldn't put a decarbonisation target in the Energy Bill this week\": It is good for ministers to challenge people to raise their aspirations and ambitions, and targets are part of that process, but they can only be relevant if we know how to meet them. As a minister, I always questioned targets where there was not a 'roadmap' for delivering them. The challenge with a decarbonisation target set now for 2030 is that we cannot yet know how it can be met - or indeed, if it can be met. Nuclear may not happen on the scale hoped for - and it is hard to see how we can meet a decarbonisation target without new nuclear. Some of the emerging renewable technologies, such as offshore wind and tidal, may remain too expensive, and we don't yet know if their costs will come down to make them affordable for consumers. Carbon capture and storage, which could give a low-carbon future for coal and gas, has yet to be proven commercially, and we don't yet know if it would cost. Unabated gas is relatively plentiful and is certainly lower in its carbon intensity than coal, but on its own would not enable us to reach the low level of emissions which the 2030 target would be likely to require. My difficulty with the target, therefore, is that we would be requiring it to be set without knowing that it can be met, and that cannot be a responsible decision for government to make, when the costs of getting it wrong would have to be picked up by consumers for decades to come. And Stephen Gilbert, the MP for St Austell and Newquay, has posted his thoughts on Liberal Democrat Voice: What we have got is the power to set the world’s first decarbonisation target for the electricity sector 14 years ahead of the target date of 2030. Are critics of this compromise agreement seriously suggesting that setting a target 14 years in advance is such a disaster when, for example, the 2020 renewables target was set 12 years in advance and we will not be setting the 5th carbon budget till 12 years before that starts in 2028? Here are the thoughts of Philip Pearson, senior policy officer at the TUC: Uncertainty over the government’s support for renewable energy and its drift away from the green economy has caused manufacturers to hold back investment, such as the proposed Siemens factory on Hull docks, in a city where 14 people chase every vacancy. Thousands of large-scale offshore wind turbines are due to be installed in the UK, but none so far have been wholly made in the UK. Renewable UK argues that the government should send the right signals to major investors deciding where to build major wind turbine factories. Targets on emissions and renewables for 2030 are key to providing a long-term framework for investment. There’s evidence that annual growth in renewable energy rose sharply since the EU introduced renewable energy targets, from a growth rate of 1.9% per annum (1995-2000) to 4.5% (2001-2010). The EU ETS has failed to date to deliver long-term carbon price signals. It’s fair to say that the mandatory renewable energy targets for 2020 has addressed this market failure by accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across the EU. We need to maintain that momentum by continuing this targeted approach to 2030. For those who want to watch today's debate and vote, the Commons website has a live feed available here. Tim Yeo is due to make his speech introducing the amendment at 12.30pm. I will post extracts in due course. In the reader comments below, @BBCbias and @EGriff have asked whether the government is on course to meet its 2020 emissions reduction target. Last October, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) published its latest \"updated emissions projections\" (pdf). To recap the 2020 target: The carbon budgets require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 34%, against 1990 levels, by 2020. And here's what it says on page 19: The updated projections suggest that the UK is likely to comfortably meet its first three carbon budgets. [The 3rd budget covers the period 2018-2022.] However, the table on page 20 suggests that the 4th carbon budget, covering the period 2023-2027, is not likely to be met, according to the latest projections. Following on from Andrew Pendleton's view quoted earlier, Guy Shrubshole, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, has emailed me his more detailed thoughts on today's vote: The vote today on a clean power target is a choice between two alternative visions of Britain’s energy future. A vote for Tim Yeo’s amendment is a vote to stay within our existing Climate Change Act commitments, and meet them in a way that the government’s own advisers say is cheapest and most cost-effective. If we don’t take the carbon out of our electricity supply, we would have to find other ways to cut more carbon from other sectors, such as transport or heating - and that’s likely to be much more expensive. But the chancellor, George Osborne, opposes a clear target to decarbonise the power sector and favours an alternative route - to embark on building over 30 new gas plants in a new dash for gas. If Osborne gets his way, there is no question that the UK will breach its legally binding climate change targets. The difference between the chancellor's vision and low-carbon power is staggering. Late last year the government brought out a gas strategy in which it considered - at the treasury’s behest - a plan for a tripling of gas power from today’s levels. This would only be possible, the government admitted, if the legally-binding 4th carbon budget (covering the years 2022-2027) were to be weakened to allow for higher carbon emissions. Osborne’s high-carbon route would result in an extra 500m tonnes of carbon dioxide being emitted over the period 2020-2040: equivalent to every UK car and taxi on the road for eight years, or every UK flight for 16 years. This figure is based on Friends of the Earth’s analysis of the government’s own figures, full details of which can be found here. Without a clear and binding 2030 clean power target, there’s no guarantee that Osborne won’t embark on a dash for gas, and breach our climate goals - or, at the very least, make them much more expensive to meet. When the clean alternative also brings with it new investment and jobs for the UK, you can see why so many MPs are rebelling to include a clean power target in the energy bill! BBC News online has an assessment of how the vote is likely to pan out: Mr Yeo's amendment, calling for a decarbonisation \"target range\" to be set by April 2014, could be backed by more than 10 Lib Dems and a handful of Conservatives. Among those to sign the amendment are former Lib Dem minister Andrew Stunnell and Tory backbenchers Zac Goldsmith, Sir Peter Bottomley and David Amess. If passed, the BBC's environmental analyst Roger Harrabin said it would ensure that almost all electricity is generated from carbon-free sources like wind and nuclear by 2030. However, the government is still expected to win the vote when the matter is debated later in the House of Commons. Some interesting comments have already been posted below by readers... Earlier this week, Katja Hall, the CBI's chief policy director, set out her views, including her specific thoughts on the decarbonisation amendment: The energy bill remains the best instrument for government to give investors the certainty they need to plough billions of pounds into keeping UK lights on, through an affordable low-carbon economy. We can’t afford further delays, so it is essential there’s political agreement and the bill is on the statute book this year. The government will need to make sure that households and businesses most vulnerable to increased energy prices are adequately protected. The CBI supports the Climate Change Act and the carbon targets and budgets contained in it, but the bill must deliver the necessary pace of decarbonisation if they are to be achieved. It is clear that investment decisions will stand or fall on the details of the contracts for difference, the capacity mechanism, and the levy control framework – not on a carbon intensity target. Debates about the effect of including a target in the bill should not be allowed to prevent critical policy details being tied down. Vital investment decisions are hanging in the balance. My colleague Fiona Harvey now has a preview of today's vote live on the Guardian website: Pressure was mounting on Liberal Democrat MPs on Tuesday to vote for a rebel amendment to the coalition's energy bill that would require steep cuts in carbon emissions from electricity generation. Green campaigners have piled on the pressure, urging Lib Dems to break ranks with official coalition policy at the last minute to join Labour and a small number of Tory rebels to call for a strengthening of the crucial bill. The requirement for an effective decarbonisation of electricity generation in the UK by 2030 was dropped from the energy bill at an early stage, but an amendment to be debated on Tuesday afternoon, at the bill's third reading, would restore the target. The article includes reaction from two leading environmental NGOs... Greenpeace: \"The Lib Dems must ensure that come the next election, the energy bill is something they can be proud of, rather than an additional thing they must defend on the doorstep,\" said Doug Parr, chief scientist and policy director of Greenpeace UK. \"For the sake of households struggling with gas bills, and for the sake of the climate, they must not allow clean energy to be another concession to the Tory right...\" Investors in low-carbon power generation were being scared off by the lack of a decarbonisation goal and the coalition government's seeming lack of support for clean energy, Parr said. \"Without the target, there is no certainty for the low-carbon sector, a sector that provided over a third of the UK's economic growth in 2011-12. [As it stands] the energy bill leaves the door open for dirty coal and gas power stations to stay online for decades, which will blow the UK's carbon budgets,\" said Parr. \"This is a key opportunity for the Lib Dems to push for a win for business and the economy and to differentiate themselves from their coalition partners. If they don't, the UK could end up locked into a high-carbon, gas-dependent energy system that fatally undermines the Climate Change Act. Voters who care about the environment –which is nearly all potential Lib Dem voters – may never forgive them.\" Friends of the Earth: Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, argued the target was needed to avert a \"dash for gas\", which many on the right of the Tory party favour as an alternative to clean energy. He said: \"MPs from all parties must vote in favour of a clean power target. As well as tackling climate change and creating thousands of jobs, it will save householders billions of pounds compared to a dash for gas.\" Pendleton added: \"Investors say that they need certainty so they can make long-term investments in clean British energy. Without it we risk losing business overseas to countries that have made a clear commitment to developing a low-carbon future.\" Here are the thoughts of Nick Molho, head of energy policy at WWF UK: It’s of course theoretically possible for the UK to meet its goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 without setting a clear target to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. But given that delivering a near carbon-free power sector over the next 20 years is going to be essential to put the UK economy on a cost-effective track to meeting the 2050 climate goals, it’s difficult to see how this will happen without the energy bill providing a long-term framework to attract the huge amounts of low-carbon investment required. It’s worth restating the three key reasons why taking early action to reduce power sector emissions makes sense. First, the more we delay action to reduce emissions after 2030, the more expensive reducing our emissions will become as we will leave ourselves with an awful lot to do and very little time to do it in. Having a near-decarbonised power sector by 2030 still requires UK emissions to go down by a substantial 60% in the period between 2030 and 2050: adding more to this would not be economically sensible. Second, we already have a range of low-carbon power technologies that are either commercially available or at an advanced development stage. Third, other parts of the economy such as transport and heating will increasingly need to run on low-carbon electricity to reduce their own emissions. As things stand, if you have a renewable energy project that will be completed by 2020, then you know with a reasonable amount of certainty that your project will get the revenue it needs because the UK is bound by a renewable energy target for 2020 and the levy control framework out to 2020 has been announced. The lack of a decarbonisation target is also less of an issue for projects that have long-development times but have low capital costs. However, the lack of a decarbonisation target seriously risks delaying investments in projects that have long development times and high capital costs (such as some of the late Round 3 offshore wind projects that will be completed in the early 2020s) or in the renewable energy / low-carbon supply chain, which require several years of operation to recover the initial investment. A delay in these investments would result in not only slowing down the construction in low-carbon capacity that we need but it would also undermine the cost reductions and economic growth benefits that investment in a domestic supply chain would bring. Clearly, providing investment certainty is not just about a decarbonisation target. To have meaning, a target needs to be accompanied with certainty that funding for low-carbon projects will grow at an appropriate rate out to 2030 and that the contractual measures introduced in the energy bill will continue to be available out to 2030. Here's what the Committee on Climate Change, the body which formally advises the government on emissions targets, said (pdf) just two weeks ago on the matter of providing more confidence to energy sector investors: Extensive decarbonisation of the power sector by 2030 is feasible and economically desirable. – Considerations on the pace of decarbonisation. In considering the appropriate pace of decarbonisation to 2030 the aims should be: to stimulate investment in cost-effective low-carbon technologies (i.e. where these are cheaper over their lifetimes than unabated gas facing a carbon price); to develop less-mature technologies; to avoid stop-start investment; and to prepare for meeting the 2050 target to reduce economy-wide emissions by 80% relative to 1990. – Conclusions on the pace of decarbonisation. Based on the latest evidence on costs and feasibility, we continue to conclude that aiming to achieve a carbon intensity of around 50 gCO2/kWh in 2030 through investment in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies is feasible and desirable. There should be some flexibility to adjust this objective based on new information, for example up to 100 gCO2/kWh if costs for emerging technologies fall less quickly than expected, or if roll-out of energy efficiency, nuclear and onshore wind are more constrained... It added: Improving conditions for investment. In order to improve conditions for investment in the UK power sector the government should: set in legislation this Parliament a 2030 carbon-intensity target embodying the objective to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies... – Carbon-intensity target. This should provide a balance of confidence and incentives to industry, signalling the government’s intention to invest in a portfolio of low-carbon technologies to 2030, subject to build rates and cost reductions being achieved. Plan A should be to reduce the carbon intensity of power generation to a level of the order of 50 gCO2/kWh by 2030. A Plan B that achieves a carbon intensity of up to 100 gCO2/ kWh while maintaining a portfolio approach might become appropriate, for example if costs fall less quickly than currently envisaged, or if achievable build rates are lower than expected. This could be captured through some flexibility to change the target in light of new information or by legislating a target range of 50-100 gCO2/kWh, with clear criteria to guide which end of the range will be appropriate. At around 4pm this afternoon MPs are due to vote on whether to include a rebel amendment in the third reading of the energy bill that would see the virtual decarbonisation of the UK's electricity supply by 2030. The MPs co-sponsoring the amendment - the Conservative's Tim Yeo and Labour's Barry Gardiner - argue that their \"carbon intensity target\" (in effect, a limit by 2030 of 50 grams of CO2 emitted per Kwh) would reduce risks for power sector investors and also better enable the nation to met its legally enshrined target of achieving an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. They are supported by a broad coalition of NGOs, thinktanks, unions and renewables firms. However, Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, says the target should be delayed until after the next election in 2016 because no party included it in their manifesto at the last election. Writing in the Guardian today, Tim Yeo, the chair of the energy select committee, says: The inclusion of a carbon intensity target was a unanimous recommendation of the cross-party energy select committee following our scrutiny of the draft bill. As the energy bill currently stands though, the energy secretary may set one but not before 2016 at the earliest giving very little confidence to the sector. I have tabled an amendment with cross-party support to bring the date of this decision forward to 1 April 2014 and ensure it is set in line with the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, the government's statutory independent adviser tasked with monitoring the latest climate science and ensuring the UK meets its legally binding carbon reduction targets in the most cost effective manner. Should MPs vote to include the amendment? Can the UK risk further delaying this issue if it wants to meet its long-term emissions reduction goals? Please leave your own thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/jul/08/nuclearpower.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-08T18:30:00Z","webTitle":"Daniel Koffler: Nuclear power should be a part of the candidates' energy policies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/nuclearpower.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/nuclearpower.energy","fields":{"headline":"The case for nuclear power","bodyText":"In keeping with the frenetic, rhetorical ping-pong that has marked virtually every moment of this young general election, Barack Obama gave a big energy policy speech in Las Vegas last month to counter the big energy speech John McCain gave just prior to it. Obama proposed a substantial federal investment in alternative energy sources, including wind power, solar power and biofuels, and he promised to hike fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks (though he didn't say by how much). He has already proposed a cap-and-trade scheme with auctions for emissions permits, which are key to making any such scheme work. (John McCain's version of cap-and-trade does not include auctions.) Nuclear power, however, does not figure into Obama's proposed alternatives to reliance on petroleum. On the contrary, he used the Las Vegas setting to hammer home, literally, his objection to McCain's proposal for the construction of 45 new nuclear power plants - a touchy subject in Nevada, given that the only site the US department of energy has designated for the storage of nuclear waste in the continental US (under the Clinton administration, incidentally) is the repository at Yucca Mountain, about 130 km from metropolitan Las Vegas. Now, to be clear, Obama's energy programme on the whole is a sound and long-overdue, if not terribly ambitious, adjustment in the US approach to fuelling its economy. McCain's programme, by contrast, is a counterproductive, incoherent mash. But on the specific issue of nuclear power, McCain is exactly right, and Obama is badly wrong. Nuclear power is green in multiple senses. The most important criterion by which to judge any viable alternative to petroleum is the magnitude of its contribution to global warming. Well, uranium or petroleum fission produces no carbon emissions whatsoever, since there is no carbon involved. The cooling process does produce water vapour, but water vapour and carbon dioxide are both greenhouse gases in the same sense that Roger Federer and I are both tennis players (and water vapour emissions, moreover, can be controlled). The environmental downsides of nuclear power are therefore not any more severe than other alternative energy sources, such as wind or solar power, and are arguably less severe than biofuels like the ethanol that Obama heartily supports. These energy sources all entail waste heat, produce solid waste and have other drawbacks - but the environmental drawbacks of all of them, nukes included, are quite modest. From a fiscal perspective, nuclear power enjoys enormous advantages over other environmentally friendly energies. At their present state of technological development, nuclear reactors can already power large industrial societies. Wind and solar power are not there yet, and biofuels (particularly ethanol) are something of an embarrassing racket, being extraordinarily inefficient and requiring huge government subsidies to be propped up. The case for nuclear power is even stronger when considering the weakness of the case against it, which rests largely on a series of panics 20 to 30 years old. For example, the Chernobyl disaster was the product of horrific Soviet mismanagement over the many years prior to the meltdown, followed by equally abysmal crisis management. It simply had nothing to do with the upkeep challenges of a modern nuclear plant. Worries about the impact of radioactive waste, by contrast, are at least marginally connected to real features of current nuclear plants, but they are wildly overblown. For one thing, the vast majority of nuclear waste - as much as 95% or more - can be reprocessed and reused, making it a truly renewable resource. For another, the technology required to render radioactive waste inert and harmless already exists, and it ought to be largely perfected by the time any new plants go online. Then there are the silly and borderline mystical grounds for opposition to nuclear power, about which the less said the better (but let's be indulgent). Nuclear power plants, as the anti-nuclear movement frequently points out, use the same fuel sources and much of the same science as nuclear weapons. But that makes them as much like nuclear weapons as heart medications containing nitroglycerin are like dynamite. Alternatively, some anti-nuclear activists treat all nuclear technology as some sort of inherent transgression against nature. That argument relies on deeply reactionary concepts of \"naturalness\" and \"unnaturalness\" that also form the basis of opposition to any number of technologies that improve the quality of human life in countless ways. The argument against nuclear power as unnatural deserves no more or less respect than the arguments against childhood vaccination and stem-cell research as unnatural. Whatever else can be said about them, such sentiments have precious little to do with environmentalism. Obama, however, brushed aside nuclear power as a policy option in approximately one half of one sentence in his speech, on grounds different from and even worse than any of the foregoing. McCain's \"proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than right here at Yucca Mountain\" makes no sense, Obama told the Las Vegas crowd. But did Obama propose some other site for storing nuclear waste or offer some further argument against nuclear power? No, he just dropped the subject. In other words, even as he rightly mocked the risible gimmicks McCain has cobbled together as an ersatz energy policy, Obama's opposition to nuclear energy, in its entirety, is nothing more than a naked pander for Nevada's five electoral votes. For a politician ostensibly committed to environmentalism in general and curbing global warming in particular, omitting nuclear power from his energy programme - let alone doing so on no principle higher than grabbing votes - is irresponsible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2011/jul/05/scienceofclimatechange-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-05T18:59:00Z","webTitle":"Scientists finally get angry about indifference to climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/05/scienceofclimatechange-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2011/jul/05/scienceofclimatechange-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Scientists finally get angry about indifference to climate change","bodyText":"James Hansen never expected to become a radical activist at the age of 65. He is a grandfather who loves nothing more than exploring nature with his grandchildren. He holds down a respectable job as the director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. But he is 70 now, and he has a police record. Hansen gets himself arrested, testifies in court on behalf of others who have broken the law and issues public pronouncements that have made Nasa try to gag him – all because he can't bear the thought that his grandchildren might hold him responsible for a burned-out planet. Hansen is the climate scientist's climate scientist. He has testified about the issue in front of Congress, but has had enough of the standard government response – \"greenwash\", he calls it. Last month, Hansen issued an uncompromising plea for Americans to involve themselves with civil unrest over climate change. \"We want you to consider doing something hard – coming to Washington in the hottest and stickiest weeks of the summer and engaging in civil disobedience that will likely get you arrested,\" he says in a letter on grist.org. However many Americans turn up to get arrested in Washington, it's unlikely that Hansen will end up sharing a cell with other scientists. He cuts a lone figure on the barricades; almost all scientists run shy of such public misbehaviour. In private, science has always been a brutal, gladiatorial arena. To be successful you have to challenge established thinking, force out the old guard and prove beyond question that you are right. That takes extraordinary tenacity, resourcefulness and courage. The tragedy is that these laudable attributes are rarely channelled into tackling areas where science highlights something of global concern. Yes, scientists compile and contribute to reports on issues such as climate change. But those reports are made public only when the scientists have agreed on the most conservative of conclusions, satisfying the lowest common denominator among those whose names appear on the documents. The UN's climate monitor, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for example, issues reports that stand accused of underplaying sea level rises. According to a report published by the US National Academy of Sciences, levels may rise three times faster than IPCC estimates. That is not to say that climate scientists don't privately agree about what is going on with our planet. In April 2010 a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that nearly 98% of working climate scientists accept the evidence for human-induced climate change. The voices of dissent reported \"for balance\" come almost exclusively from researchers who are not publishing in the field. Unfortunately, this consensus over climate change is in danger of becoming the world's best-kept secret. According to the World Bank's 2010 World Development Report, 17% of US citizens think that the properly scientific view is to be sceptical about climate change, while 43% believe that scientists are \"evenly divided\". Who is to blame for this gulf between reality and perception? The media? The government? No. When they are being honest, the scientists blame themselves. And that's why Hansen – and a handful of other scientists – are bypassing traditional outlets for scientific results. If Hansen gets arrested this summer, it will complete his hat-trick: he has already been arrested twice at environmental protests. In 2009 police dragged him and actor Daryl Hannah off a mountain road in West Virginia. They and hundreds of other protesters had sat down in protest at a local company's intention to access the mountain's coal deposits by packing it with explosives and blowing its top off. The second arrest came last year in Washington, at a protest over similar practices. Hansen's attitude echoes that of Sherwood Rowland, who won a Nobel prize for his research into the effects of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases on the ozone layer. \"What's the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions,\" Rowland said, \"if all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true?\" Rowland's colleagues shunned him for his activism. Even the iconic environmentalist James Lovelock called for a \"bit of British caution\" in the face of what he saw as Rowland's \"missionary\" zeal for a ban on CFCs. In the end, it was only the terrifying discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica that galvanised the politicians. US academics Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway have highlighted the disappointing timidity of scientists. On acid rain, climate change, tobacco marketing and the ozone crisis, they \"would have liked to have told heroic stories of how scientists set the record straight\" in their book Merchants of Doubt, but scientists fighting back have been \"conspicuously scarce\". \"Clearly, scientists knew that many contrarian claims were false,\" they lament. \"Why didn't they do more to refute them?\" The answer is, because of the party line established in the post-war era: offer advice only if asked. Academic science is a relatively new profession: it sprang up after the second world war, when governments realised that whoever invested the most in science would win the next war. It quickly became a lucrative and safe career option. But there was a cost involved: science had to promise to behave itself. The atomic bomb, the V2 rockets and the threat of nerve and mustard gases had all contributed to the view of science as something that had to be tightly controlled. \"People hate scientists,\" biologist Jacob Bronowski observed in 1956. And so scientists developed an attitude of forelock-tugging subservience, \"the monk of our age, timid, thwarted, anxious to be asked to help,\" as Bronowski put it. While most scientists have learned keep their heads down, a few are beginning to argue that what a scientist knows must inform his or her personal opinions and values. That's why a group of young Australian climate scientists released an expletive-filled music video earlier this year. It was an angry rap aimed at those who question climate science while holding no qualifications in the field. They used the rather unscientific word \"motherfucker\" and poured scorn on \"bitches\" opposing a carbon tax. Hearteningly, there may be more of this to come. Paul Nurse, the new president of the Royal Society, has said he would be happy to see scientists getting fully engaged with politics and involved with activism. And scientists are no longer hated: they are, in fact, overwhelmingly popular, and much more trusted than politicians. A 2010 survey of European citizens revealed that 63% of people think government or academic scientists are best qualified to explain the impact of scientific and technological developments on society (only 11% think politicians should do the job). It's not just about explaining, either. A 2009 Pew survey revealed that three-quarters of the public would like to see scientists active in political debates about such issues as nuclear power or stem cell research. Those who have hitherto fought within the ivory towers to establish the science of climate change now need to muster up enough courage to take their fighting spirit out of the laboratory and onto the streets. Activist scientists will soon find themselves wondering why they cowered in the shadows for all those years. After all, as Bronowski also said: \"dissent is the native activity of the scientist\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/08/carbon-plan-coalition-green-credentials","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-08T16:29:57Z","webTitle":"Carbon Plan fails to claw back coalition's green credentials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/08/carbon-plan-coalition-green-credentials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/08/carbon-plan-coalition-green-credentials","fields":{"headline":"Carbon Plan fails to claw back coalition's green credentials","bodyText":"When his government's credibility was on the slide, Yes Minister's Jim Hacker always knew what to do. \"We're getting unpopular – organise an initiative will you, Sir Humphrey?\" And, at first sight, bolstering the coalition's fast-fading green credentials appears to be the intention of the new cross-government Carbon Plan, published today by energy and climate change secretary Chris Huhne. Yet Huhne's document is actually quite a canny bit of politics. Most of the 130 or so actions which it commits the government to taking over the next two years are just milestones in existing policy processes, many of them continuing those of the Labour government, which had already put in place carbon budgets for each Whitehall department. But a few are new, and in publishing them Huhne appears to have drawn several of his Cabinet colleagues into making commitments before they would have wanted to, while locking in others to existing policies they may have wished to wriggle out of. Under the plan, the Department for Business is committed to getting the Green Investment Bank operational by September next year – before the Treasury has approved key decisions on its structure and remit. Technically the Treasury could still oppose Huhne's plans for the bank; he is adamant that it must be able to borrow from the capital markets to finance a new wave of low-carbon energy infrastructure, while the Treasury wants it to be simply a government fund, with a much more restricted remit. But the announcement further ratchets up the pressure on George Osborne. Similarly, it is unlikely Philip Hammond at the department of transport would have announced a strategy for electric car infrastructure as early as June. Most remarkably of all, the plan commits the Treasury to legislating to create a minimum carbon price by next month. The carbon price is the cost companies have to pay to emit a tonne of carbon under the European Emissions Trading Scheme; it's currently too low and too volatile to incentivise the kind of investment in low-carbon energy supply the government wants (particularly new nuclear power stations). The Treasury has been consulting on the possibility of introducing a tax mechanism that would guarantee a floor below which the price could not fall – but until yesterday it had not announced the conclusions it had reached, and these were not expected until the next budget. It is quite a coup for Huhne to pre-announce a budget measure. But it's also risky. A carbon price floor is just one of the government's options for incentivising a low-carbon electricity. Reform of Britain's electricity market is a fiendishly complex process with huge ramifications for our energy industry and the bills that consumers will face. The white paper setting out the full proposed reform package is now not expected till June. Pre-empting it with an otherwise unexplained announcement on a carbon price floor risks antagonising business and campaign groups and pre-judging many of the key questions which are yet to be answered. The Carbon Plan gives the impression that Huhne, a Liberal Democrat, is in a strong position. But the reality is that it is also a sign of weakness. He has been struggling to persuade his ministerial colleagues – particularly but not exclusively the Tory ones – to prioritise the low-carbon policy needed to meet the binding cuts in greenhouse emissions introduced by Labour and help drive a low-carbon economic recovery. This week was meant to see the coordination of announcements from government departments supporting 'green growth'. In practice it looks as if only Huhne's department of Energy and Climate Change is making any. Stung by criticism from shadow DECC minister Meg Hillier that the government has no more of a green growth strategy than one for growth in general, Huhne is keen to persuade Osborne to green this month's budget. But reports from the Treasury are not encouraging. The wider story here is that, Huhne aside, the government has lost a lot of credibility on environmental issues. Nick Clegg and David Cameron have sensibly added their names to the foreword to this week's Carbon Plan, but that only points up their conspicuous silence in this field since the election. This might be understandable given the other problems on their plate, but it has irritated the those who care deeply about environmental issues. With Caroline Spelman laying claim to be the worst environment secretary since Nicholas Ridley – with her disastrous handling of the privatisation of national forests followed last week by a botched announcement on Whitehall oversight of sustainable development, which has unleashed another furious reaction from Jonathon Porritt – Cameron's claim that his would be the \"greenest government ever\" looks increasingly like a millstone round the coalition's neck."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/02/japan-naoto-kan-no-confidence-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-02T14:25:00Z","webTitle":"Japan's Naoto Kan survives no-confidence vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/02/japan-naoto-kan-no-confidence-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/02/japan-naoto-kan-no-confidence-vote","fields":{"headline":"Japan's Naoto Kan survives no-confidence vote","bodyText":"The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has comfortably survived a no-confidence motion after offering to resign as soon as plans for Japan's recovery from the tsunami and nuclear crisis are in place. MPs in the 480-seat lower house of Japan's parliament voted down the motion on Thursday afternoon by 293 votes to 152. By offering to quit, possibly in the autumn, Kan has bought himself a few more months in office. The move will enable him to oversee the operation to stabilise the nuclear plant – which is expected to take several months – and to secure emergency funding for the reconstruction of the country's battered north-east coast. The fate of Thursday's motion, submitted by the main opposition Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and other opposition parties, was sealed after Kan's main rival in his own Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), Ichiro Ozawa, indicated he would abstain along with 50 of his supporters, having earlier threatened to side with the opposition. Although he survived the motion, Kan faces a difficult few months, during which he is expected to struggle to reach deals on emergency budgets in a deeply divided parliament, and to introduce a controversial tax rise. The no-confidence motion has exposed divisions inside his own party, with DPJ executives vowing to take action against rebel MPs who voted with the opposition. Kan, who has been in office for almost a year, managed to pre-empt his opponents earlier in the day when he pledged to resign once his disaster mission was complete, and suggested it was time the political elite made way for a new generation. \"I would like the younger generation to take over various responsibilities once I have finished fulfilling certain roles as a I work on handling the disaster,\" he told DPJ MPs. \"The nuclear crisis is ongoing, and I will make my utmost efforts to end the crisis and move forward with post-quake reconstruction work.\" His offer to resign convinced his predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, who also leads a large DPJ faction, to withdraw his support for the no-confidence motion. Kyodo News reported that Ozawa, a longtime Kan nemesis and notorious power broker, would abstain. At one stage it had looked possible that opposition parties would come tantalisingly close to securing the votes of the 80 or so governing party MPs they needed to force Kan to resign or call a general election. Kan, Japan's fifth prime minister since 2006, remained vague about when he would step down. Shizuka Kamei, the leader of a minor partner, said he should resign as soon as the nuclear crisis has been resolved. Kan's success in buying time to oversee the start of Japan's reconstruction, which could cost up to £113bn, has all but ruined the prospects for a grand coalition comprising the DPJ and the LDP, whose leader, Sadakazu Tanigaki, was behind the no-confidence motion. \"Among possible scenarios the best one would be Kan voluntarily resigning and the DPJ forming a coalition with the LDP to stabilise politics,\" said Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at the Mizuho research institute in Tokyo. \"Unstable politics would weigh on stock prices and delay reconstruction after the disaster. \"From both Japanese and foreign investors' point of view, now is not the time for political turmoil. Japan has various issues it needs to address swiftly – not only reconstruction but also tax and social security reform, TPP [a transpacific free trade agreement] and energy policy, which requires political initiative.\" The return to business as usual in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political nerve centre, has been met with anger and disbelief in the country's north-east, where about 100,000 people are still living in evacuation shelters and construction of temporary housing is behind schedule. The damage to the region's administrative infrastructure would have made it all but impossible for some communities to take part in a general election had the no-confidence motion succeeded. \"We are in a situation of having to delay the prefectural assembly election because elections cannot be held in our prefecture right now,\" Miyagi prefecture's governor, Yoshihiro Murai, told reporters. \"It will be difficult to hold a lower house election, especially in the municipalities along the coast.\" An 82-year-old resident of Kamaishi who was living in a local school told the Asahi Shimbun: \"Once things become more settled in the region struck by the disaster, they can go ahead and dissolve the lower house as many times as they like. If they dissolve it now, I will abstain from voting.\" A day of political turmoil in Japan coincided with a visit by the British business secretary, Vince Cable, who offered British help with the operation to remove waste from the nuclear plant and to decommission its reactors once they have achieved \"cold shutdown\". \"We can help with strategic planning, technical help with various aspects of decommissioning and waste disposal – we have a lot of experience in that field – and independent verification, if that's what the Japanese need,\" Cable said. \"But the most important contribution we're making on the nuclear issue at the moment is being scientifically rational. This whole issue is in danger of getting out of control. \"The fact that [UK chief nuclear adviser] John Beddington has been here and looked at this scientifically has an impact on UK public opinion. It's about perception.\" The Fukushima nuclear accident prompted Japan to abandon plans to build new reactors and Germany to announce it would close all of its atomic plants by 2022. But Cable said British energy policy, which envisions a key role for nuclear, remained unchanged. \"There were periodic outbursts in the newspapers at the time [of the accident] and you've seen what's happened in Germany with a sudden switch of policy. We're not changing our policy. \"There's a continuing emphasis on safety – that's got to be scientifically based – and we don't believe in subsidisation of the industry. But we've got no fundamental, theological objections. \"In the UK we've committed ourselves to these very ambitious low-carbon budgets, and it's explicit that nuclear power has a significant role to play, provided safety issues are properly addressed and the government isn't called upon to offer subsidies.\" Cable, who is the first cabinet minister to visit Tokyo since the 11 March disaster, pledged British support for Japan as it attempts to put its economy back on track. \"One of the main reasons I'm here is to show solidarity with the Japanese,\" he said. \"Britain has given a lot of practical help with humanitarian assistance and our companies have pitched in in various ways. \"But one of the most useful ways we can help is to show that Japan is safe and that there is no reason why business people shouldn't come here. \"The message is that Japan is a country we want to do business with. Come here and get on with it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/apr/15/half-life-of-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-15T15:34:16Z","webTitle":"The half-life of disaster | Brian Massumi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/15/half-life-of-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/15/half-life-of-disaster","fields":{"headline":"The half-life of disaster","bodyText":"The world watched in horror as the northeast coast of Honshu was shaken by an earthquake of unimaginable magnitude, then razed by a tsunami of monstrous force. The natural disaster struck with a suddenness defying comprehension. It is as if a body blow to Japan had knocked the wind out of the world. The hit was so sudden as to leave one speechless. One minute, a city; the next, twisted metal and rubble. Life one minute; death the next. The media images showed all there was to say: the horror. The breathtaking, senseless horror of it, surpassing the human scale of understanding. Then amid the rubble, life began to stir again. The media lens zooms in to the human scale. Language regains its descriptive traction. A family finds a loved one against all odds. A volunteer doctor travels 18 hours each way to spend a few precious hours of his weekend days off ministering to the traumatised and wounded. A last survivor is pulled from the rubble days after all were feared dead. The human stories apply a narrative balm to shock-raw nerves. The shock is soon alloyed with admiration for the Japanese people's calm and fortitude in the face of the disaster. An affective corner starts to be turned: from horror to heart warming. Of course, nothing can ever expunge the horror. It will be archived. The images of the disaster will be held indefinitely in store. For as long as there is an internet, they will remain available for recirculation. It is not so much that the horror is replaced by human warmth and its accompaniments. It is rather that it \"decays\" in the media. The horror transmutes into a different affective element, its intensity halved, then halved again, eventually reducing to trace levels. Globally, the event settles back into a more stable range of the periodic table of collective emotion. What is the half-life of disaster in today's global media? At most two weeks. The suffering on the ground continues, and will continue for decades. World attention quickly shifts elsewhere. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami were soon displaced from media attention by a next unforeseen shock: upheaval in Libya. This progression is familiar by now. Hurricane in Louisiana, tsunami in the Indian Ocean, flooding in Germany, flooding in Pakistan, fires in Greece, earthquake in Haiti. Terrorist attacks in New York, Madrid, London, Moscow. Natural disaster and terrorism define the poles of disaster. In between stretches a continuum of disaster, a plenum of frightful events of infinite variety, at every scale, coming one after the other in an endless series. The media plays its role of affective conversion with a regularity that is as predictable as each event in the series, taken separately, is shockingly unforeseen. First the affective strike of the event is instantaneously transmitted, cutting a shocked-and-awed hole of horror into the fabric of the everyday. The ability to make sense of events is suspended in a momentary hiatus of humanly unbearable, unspeakable horror. Then comes the zoom-in to the human detail. Stories get human traction. The horror is alloyed, its impact archived. Another event has been affectively conveyed with irruptive, interruptive force, only to subside into the background of everyday life. What remains is a continuous, low-level fear. This fear doesn't stand out clearly as an emotion. It is more like a habitual posture, an almost bodily bracing for the next unforeseen blow, a tensing infusing every move and every moment with a vague foreboding. This trace-form anticipation – this post-shock pre-posturing – becomes the very medium of everyday life. The environment of life is increasingly lived as a diffuse and foreboding \"threat environment\". It is almost a relief when the next hit comes. It is only another bout of disaster that will enable the narrative balm to calm again the collective nerves of a humanity permanently on low-level boil. This fear defies a collective response. When response is re-enabled, it is on the individual scale of the personal actions of \"everyday heroes\" carrying out small deeds of voluntaristic support. At this becalming pole of the affective conversion circuit, human agency is reasserted, but in the exemplary figure of individual actors exercising personal choice. By contrast, the out-of-scale strike of the unforeseen event seems utterly inhuman, an \"act of God' – by which is meant \"nature\". Any event that strikes like fate with a speed or at a scale beyond the ken of human sense-making takes on the aspect of an uncontrollable force of nature. This applies even to wholly human-caused events, such as terrorist attacks. An association is established between \"natural disaster\" and \"national security threat\", which discourages any response other than the cyclic, media-driven return to the voluntaristic, individual human scale. That affective pattern becomes second nature. The association between natural disaster and national security becomes almost automatic. Shortly after Barack Obama's election as US president, his staff sent out a press release announcing the appointment of his national security team. It contained a tell-tale typographic error. The American public was assured of the dedication and competence of its new \"natural security\" team. Three points stand out: 1) Collective response does, of course, go on. But it takes the privileged form of a growing state security apparatus. The anti-terrorism doctrine of the US explicitly includes emergency response to natural disaster in its purview. All suddenly striking, unforeseen events that defy human logic and thus seem to substract themselves from the political sphere in its everyday functioning are lumped together in the same category, and together fall under the jurisdiction of a security apparatus that is continually growing new arms and extending old ones, weaving itself into a complex, tentacular network. The network is designed to enable seamless relay from civilian emergency response to military response. Hurricane Katrina, for example, was used by the Bush administration to break down the historical prohibition against the domestic deployment of national military force in America. A US National Guard was recalled from Iraq for service in Louisiana. When the fires were ravaging Greece in the summer of 2009, the Greek government declared the senseless, unforeseen disaster a terrorist threat, because it could not be ruled out that it had been the result of terrorist-connected arson. The army was called in. Tendencies such as these blur the boundary between the policing of civil society and the military sphere, and between natural activity, criminal activity, and acts of war. The distinction between civil society and the state of exception that is war is operationally blurred by the exercise of a \"full-spectrum force\" that is every much as diffuse and protean as the \"threat environment\" it purportedly secures. Measures suspending civil and political rights are extended and multiplied, and increasingly applied preemptively. The right to peaceful dissent suffers (witness the preemptive military-style tactics mobilised against peaceful demonstrators who had broken no law in Copenhagen at the climate talks in 2009 and at the G20 meeting in Toronto in 2010). Collective action is further restrained as the state of exception becomes the norm. The threat environment becomes an open field for autocratic intervention and arbitrary exercises of power operating on a continuum with military force. True to form, the nuclear disaster unfolding at the Fukushima reactor as a consequence of the earthquake and tsunami became \"an opportunity for this pacifist nation to rely on its military at a level unseen since world war two,\" as the Japanese Self-Defense Forces are mobilised for civilian duty. Crucially, these developments are no longer legitimated in terms of political reason or reason of state. The blurring of the boundaries between war and peace, and the full-spectrum potential militarisation it fosters, is legitimated affectively, through the media-driven affective conversion circuit just described. In that affective logic, against the all-encompassing background of low-level fear, the tentacularly extending security apparatus appears as \"natural\" and as fateful as the events it is designed to respond to or preempt. 2) The periodic heartwarming return to the personal level and human scale obscures the reality that there is, in fact, a strange complicity at work between the human-caused and the naturally occurring. Hurricane Katrina was a \"natural\" disaster only if you fail to note the effects of climate change on the water temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico, and the environmentally ruinous \"management\" by the US Corps of Engineers of the Mississippi River floodplain. A similar complicity between causal factors of different orders, natural and human, was at work at Fukushima: tectonic shift meets nuclear energy infrastructure. The natural and the human are everywhere co-factors in disaster. They co-compose disaster in a way that can be fiendishly complex. But they are not simply in fusion or confusion. The media-borne affective conversion circuit upon which political power increasingly relies for its legitimation obscures the actual dynamics of this interlinkage. The return to the human personal level short-circuits any collective response that is not already either inscribed in the same logic of exploitative development that has brought the world to this juncture, or in complicity with the national/natural security apparatuses of full-spectrum force that move forcefully against those enacting alternate strategies of collective action in the name of alternate collective futures. 3) The actual dynamics of the disaster-prone interlinking of the complex systems just described involves a third complex system: the global economy. As the crisis of 2008 illustrated once again, capitalism itself is a far-from-equilibrium system eminently capable of generating its own endemic disasters. The financialisation of the capitalist economy has taken it to a level of complexity defying logic or description – not to mention regulation. It is as if capitalism has extruded its own, dedicated threat environment, in the form of abstract financial instruments operating on the edge of chaos, permanently under the pall of the spectre of debt crisis. A portion of finance capital, of course, still comes down to earth as investment capital. But this is always done with a view to maximising fluidity, in ways that fuel a perpetual self-destructuring of the economy, compensated for by a continual, quasi-chaotic remodelling of it. This is the aspect of capitalism that Schumpeter called its drive to \"creative destruction\", and which Naomi Klein has suggestively named \"disaster capitalism\". The quasi-chaos of the process only further feeds such phenomena as the movements of migrant labour, which the nation-states are finding so destabilising. It also gives rise, in angry reaction, to movements of contestation which sometimes adopt, in desperation, exactly the kind of \"asymmetrical warfare\" that national/natural security apparatuses categorise as \"terrorist\", and which they fear above all things. As a counterweight to the conditions of precariousness fostered by disaster capitalism itself, certain key economic sectors are allowed to consolidate through mergers. These quasi-monopolistic movements are tolerated, or even encouraged, in the name of securing the economy's future stability. This has been significantly the case in the energy sector, with policies friendly to centralised production and quasi-monopolistic ownership designed, for example, to revive the nuclear power industry or to kick-start capital-intensive pseudo-green \"alternatives\" like biofuels and the mythical \"clean\" coal – precisely the kinds of choices that will render the global situation even more precarious in the long run by making a mockery of attempts to rein in global warming, and by setting the stage for future generations' Fukushimas. As long as disaster capitalism reigns – which no doubt will be as long as capitalism itself reigns – the world will be caught in a vicious circle: that of responding by increasingly draconian and ill-advised means to a threat environment whose dangers the response only contributes to intensifying. The only way out is to militate for an alternate interlinkage: between global anticapitalist political contestation and a renascent environmental movement with opposition to nuclear power at its heart. A political ecology up to the task would embrace the human-nature hybridity, in all its complexity, but toward a new alliance designed to step outside the vicious circle. Also required is a realisation that the affective turn in the functioning of political legitimation that has come with the media saturation of global culture is likely irreversible. An ecological alter-politics must also be an alter-politics of affect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jun/05/dukan-diet-obesity-catherine-bennett","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-04T23:06:14Z","webTitle":"Rich pickings from living off the fat of the land | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/05/dukan-diet-obesity-catherine-bennett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/05/dukan-diet-obesity-catherine-bennett","fields":{"headline":"Rich pickings from living off the fat of the land","bodyText":"Have you ever wondered how French women stay so miraculously thin? Me neither. However, given the regularity with which this question now comes up for consideration it may not be an issue we can dodge for much longer. Supposing French women are, indeed, thinner than women from other affluent nations, is it because a) they don't eat too much or b) because so many are followers of the high-protein Dukan diet which promotes itself as \"the French medical solution\" and \"the real reason the French stay thin\", catchphrase: \"Five million French people can't be wrong\"? You might, pedantically, argue that it has not been unknown, in living memory, for at least five million French people to be less than reliable role models. Even now, the National Front's Marine le Pen remains ahead of Sarkozy in the polls. Again, if French practice provides an irrefutable argument for lifestyle change, we ought, surely, to be emulating their enthusiasm for enemas and nuclear power stations. But in the fat department, Dr Pierre Dukan has, it turns out, made an inspired marketing decision and one that might, in retrospect, help explain the shaky reputation of a fellow protein-gobbler: what does American obesity tell us about the Atkins diet? By declaring his regime the answer to the perennial question about thinness and the French, Dukan has enlisted every non-obese French woman as a testimonial, regardless of whether she has ever been persuaded by his super-scientific approach. \"Dear readers, be on your guard,\" he writes, in the new English edition of his bestseller. \"The fight against excess weight has to be carried out by doctors, this is crucial.\" Be on your guard, dear readers: Dr Dukan refers to medics of a particular persuasion and not, for example, doctors such as Dr Jean-Michel Cohen, a critic of the Dukan method, whom he is currently suing for libel. Nor does he allude to the doctors working for France's Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire, which last year included his diet in a list of 14 popular regimes which it alleged – Dr Dukan is very sensitive on this point – are ineffective and potentially dangerous to health. Dr Lecerf, who led the study, was satisfied – pace five million French people – that 95% of dieters regain weight as soon as they stop dieting. \"Each regime is less effective than the one before and the weight gain afterwards is greater each time.\" The five million French can look after themselves: what of our leading British Dukanians, Carole Middleton and Woman's Hour's Jenni Murray, the latter author of a Dukan diary in the Mail? Are they at risk? We note, at any rate, that Mrs Middleton has yet to pose in the accepted manner of triumphant slimmers, inside the gargantuan, elastic-waisted jeans worn by her obese self, alongside the headline: \"I cried when I realised I would not fit through the door of the Abbey\". As for her fellow Dukanian, following an inspirational loss of three stone, recent lapses involving chips, chocolate, wine and ice-cream now threaten to make Jenni Murray less the pin-up for protein-fuelled transformation than a reminder of this eternal truth: the diet industry is built on the repeated, utterly predictable and necessary failure of its own products. The peculiar commercial brilliance of high-protein wheezes is that once any initial, dramatic, carb-starved weight loss has given way to normality, as it must for all but the most lonely or obsessed, and to the gradual regaining of weight and fresh breath, its euphoric adherents will have already invested in the required library of diet book, recipe book, lifelong rule book – none of which can add much to what was said, with far greater modesty and concision, by William Banting in his \"Letter on Corpulence\", published in 1863. \"The great charm and comfort of the system,\" wrote Banting, after he lost 50 lbs on an eccentric but effective protein diet, \"is that its affects [sic] are palpable within a week of trial, which creates a natural stimulus to persevere for a few weeks more, when the fact becomes established beyond question.\" Or not. To be fair to Jenni Murray, she is not the only intelligent woman publicly to confess to a private habit some people would find embarrassing. Where weight loss is concerned, the most respectable journalism will suspend scepticism, offer promotional services gratis and, in extreme cases, accommodate claims that would, if made in a South African village, prompt reflections on the stubborn nature of superstition. Who would believe, for example, in singing fat away? Step forward a woman introduced in the latest Elle magazine as the Fat Whisperer. \"I talk to the fat,\" she explains. \"And I just tell it to go. I listen to the emotion in the cell membrane and I tell the cell which way to move out of the body.\" And the cell has to go somewhere, right? It's easy to be cynical, but how else, other than migrating fat cells, do you explain the plight of people who gain without over-eating? For all we know, Eric Pickles is 90% composed of Whisperer clients such as Kate Hudson and Paris Hilton. Moreover, from a first do no harm perspective, no one could say of Whispering, as Dr Jean-Michel Cohen has said of Dukan, that it causes \"veritable alimentary destruction which leads to serious health problems among certain patients such as a strong rise in cholesterol, cardiovascular problems, breast cancer\". Last week, the libel case came to court. In Cohen's defence, his lawyer has cited a study of 5,000 Dukanians, indicating – allegedly – that 80% of those who followed the diet regained their lost weight in four years. Dukan's lawyer says the figure is 40%. The only reason to doubt the purity of Jean-Michel Cohen's intentions as the enemy of \"malbouffe\" is his connection with another French diet: \"Savoir Maigrir avec Jean-Michel Cohen.\" For Dukan's part, the great carb-hater is not \"seeking profit or fame\". He wants, says his lawyer, to bring people \"slimming methods capable of bringing them ways of fighting obesity for their whole life\". I am no doctor, but if that is so would not his profits be best dedicated to nutritional education, so women won't fall for regimes like the frankfurter diet recently – and mischievously – awarded the imprimatur of the British Heart Foundation? A BHF dietician explained that a dinner of two frankfurters, half a cup of carrots, a cup of broccoli or cabbage followed by vanilla ice-cream \"lacks a number of nutrients we need to stay healthy\". How could anyone fall for it? Possibly because it looked so varied after two weeks dining, in the Dukan manner approved by Grazia, Carole and the Daily Mail, on a couple of slices of meat. Why are French women so thin? From sprinting away from Dominique Strauss-Kahn still has to be the most plausible explanation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/sep/30/uk-renewable-energy-production-drops","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-30T17:08:02Z","webTitle":"UK renewable energy production falls for second time in 2010","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/30/uk-renewable-energy-production-drops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/sep/30/uk-renewable-energy-production-drops","fields":{"headline":"UK renewable energy production falls for second time in 2010","bodyText":"The UK has suffered a second fall in renewable energy production this year, raising concern about the more than £1bn support the industry receives each year from taxpayers. The drop in electricity generated from wind, hydro and other clean sources in the first half of 2010 could also be a setback to the coalition government's promise that the UK could help lead a \"third industrial revolution\" and create a low-carbon economy. The DECC today said lower than expected wind speeds and rainfall led to a 12% fall in renewable electricity generated between April and June, compared to the same period in 2009. This setback follows a smaller but still notable decline between January and March, again compared to last year. With a sharp drop in output from nuclear power stations as well, greenhouse gas emissions from each unit of electricity generated will inevitably have risen, at a time when the UK has pledged to cut such pollution, and is pressing other countries to do the same. The renewable energy figures are likely to prompt criticism of the government's energy policies from all sides. Supporters want ministers to increase funding for green industry so more wind farms are built, reducing the risk of seasonal set backs; critics will say the government should instead increase support for energy efficiency, nuclear power or cleaner forms of burning fossil fuels. With speculation mounting that the government is considering cutting the feed-in tariff subsidy for small-scale renewable equipment, 69 industry figures and other experts will tomorrow publish an open letter to the government warning such a move would \"shatter\" confidence and put future investment \"in mortal peril\". However, Robert Gross, director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, said it was too soon to react to the drops in renewables, pointing out that other electricity sources were also vulnerable to short-term problems, such as fluctuations in supply and prices of fossil fuels and technology shutdowns at nuclear reactors. Risks were not likely to arise until renewable sources made up more than 25-35% of electricity supply, when the UK would need back up from one or more of the several options: new gas plants, better connections to mainland Europe, better demand management so more electricity was used at off-peak times, and better technology to store surplus energy for peak times, said Gross. The DECC also suggested the government was not yet planning to change its policies, which included direct support of £265m from 2000-2009, and about £1bn indirect subsidies for large installations through 'renewable obligation certificates' in 2008-9. \"Wind energy is home-grown, low-carbon and adds diversity to our energy mix,\" said a department statement. \"The intermittent nature of wind means that we do need alternative back-up generation, for when wind speeds drop. But for most of the time it will be possible to generate significant amounts of electricity from wind, thereby reducing the amount of fossil fuels we need to consume.\" The latest energy statistics for the second quarter of 2010 show total energy production in the UK was 9.2% lower than the same period last year, while final energy consumption was 1.8% higher. Among the different fuels, output from oil and coal fell, while only gas increased its output, by 7.1%. It was a similar picture for electricity alone: coal power stayed steady at about 23% of electricity supplied, nuclear output fell by 23% to 15.8%, and gas production rose by more than 10% to over half of all electricity. Chris Huhne, the climate secretary, repeatedly chastised the previous government for putting the UK in 25th place among the 27 European Union countries for renewable energy, a ranking based on 2008 figures. However, last week RenewableUK, the industry lobby group, said the UK was \"on course\" to meet its commitment to reach 15% of all energy – including at least 30% of electricity – from renewable sources by 2020. Responding to today's figures, a spokesman for the group said: \"Clearly we need to deploy more renewable devices if we expect to get more in the energy mix. Hydro and wind power will vary from year to year, as do other technologies, but we know that they can and do contribute significant amounts of electricity. \"Hydro is one the world's oldest and most widespread energy technologies, and wind power has shown its mettle across Europe. If we don't write off nuclear energy on the basis of [its latest] fall, why would we write off hydro, or even wind, which is now the UK's largest source of renewable energy?\" Louise Hutchins, climate campaigner for Greenpeace, said: \"At the moment it [renewable energy] is a very small share in electricity and small fluctuations in weather can have an impact on the percentage of supply. When we have a lot more renewable energy there will be a lot more stability.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/audio/2009/oct/19/guardian-daily-podcast","type":"audio","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-19T06:39:43Z","webTitle":"Guardian Daily podcast: Peruvian protesters 'tortured' after clash with British firm; the end of Hollywood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/audio/2009/oct/19/guardian-daily-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/audio/2009/oct/19/guardian-daily-podcast","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Daily: Peruvian protesters 'tortured' after clash with British firm","bodyText":"Solicitor Richard Meeran highlights a case he is taking to the high court about a British mining company that is facing a multimillion-dollar claim for damages following a clash between protesters and police in August 2005, which left one man bleeding to death and others injured.

Britain's future depends on a vibrant research base and the ability of innovators to exploit the country's intellectual capital to generate new home-grown, high tech industries. Despite this, our national R&amp;D spend as a proportion of GDP remains near the bottom of the G8. There is no room for complacency. Because we believe that science is vital to our economic recovery, we have pledged not to cut the science budget in 2010-11. However, because of the current economic situation, we believe it would be irresponsible to make any financial commitments beyond that until the situation can be properly reviewed. We also recognise the true position the UK is in, which is not as labour describe. This does not, however, mean we are suggesting cuts. Unlike the other parties, we have not protected any budgets - if we had, then it would be almost inevitable that non-protected budgets (like science) would suffer. We have also said in our manifesto that past Governments have been too obsessed with the City of London, and that instead we want to build \"an economy based on innovation and sustainability\". Science must inevitably play a key role in that. We have also pledged to respect the science \"ring-fence\", where once the science budget is allocated through the Comprehensive Spending Review Process, it is not used for other purposes. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? Liberal Democrats believe that all health interventions paid for by the NHS should be as evidence-based as possible, so that patients get the best treatments and taxpayers get value for money. We have said that we would ask NICE to examine all Complementary or Alternative Therapies that may be being used on the NHS to see if their use if cost-effective. If NICE's advice was that the treatment did not perform better than placebo, then of course it should not be supported by the NHS. Simon Singh: Libel What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Currently there is no statutory public interest defence, so scientists risk running the gauntlet of London's High Court if they publish material they believe to be in the public interest, but that a major corporation or litigious charlatan believes to be libellous. Our party recognises the importance of free speech to science, as well as other fields. We don't talk about draft bills or more reviews we specifically say we would legislate to: · Introduce a statutory public interest defence which covered responsible journalism, protected fair comment, as well as explicitly covering peer-reviewed work · Prevent large corporations suing individuals for libel, as we believe the asymmetry of resources unbalances the legal system · Bring in a single date of publication rule for the internet · End libel tourism · Reduce the costs of bringing and defending libel claims, while maintaining access to justice Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? No – the evidence we have seen shows that nuclear power is an extremely expensive way to generate electricity, and would require at least a decade to come into effect. That's time we don't have if we want to play our role in stopping runaway climate change, but would therefore have to spend continuing to use fossil fuels. We would prefer to use the enormous subsidies that would be needed for nuclear to invest in renewable energy and insulation, which would be a cheaper and quicker way of reducing emissions. You can find fully costed details of this plan in our manifesto. David Nutt: Drug policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? Drugs policy influences both public health and criminal justice, so it is vital that we get it right if we are not to blight the lives of thousands of people. Our approach is one of supporting policies which offer the best chance of reducing harm to individuals and to society, rather than stigmatising users or appeasing tabloid editors. We would therefore classify drugs based on what the best scientific evidence. If the evidence suggested that the best way to reduce the harm associated with a drug was to declassify it, we would do so. We would make the ACMD properly independent and guarantee the independence and academic freedom of all scientific advisory committees by including in the ministerial code the Sense about Science-hosted principles without the Government's proposed adulteration. Animal testing Is animal testing necessary? Are the ethical concerns outweighed by the benefits? How would you like to see regulations on animal testing change under your government, if at all? It is not a case of 'ethical concerns outweighing benefits'. It would be unethical not to do animal research, given the enormous potential and past benefits to medicine and public health that such research has brought. It has been vital in work on dialysis, diabetes, transplants, and the polio vaccine, to give just a few examples, and could be vital in the search for treatments for HIV/AIDS and malaria eradication. We would maintain the current strict welfare standards on animal research, and support the replacement, refinement, and minimisation of the use of animals in research as far as possible, so that only the research which is completely necessary is done. We therefore oppose the use of animals in testing cosmetics or household products. Petra Boynton: Public health How will your party ensure public health/education campaigns are underpinned by evidence, and how will you evaluate their success? PR companies are increasingly influential in directing both the content and delivery of public campaigns, frequently at the expense of expertise from scientists, healthcare providers and academics. Given that public money is spent on such campaigns, and public health is at stake, such interventions need to be as effective as possible. We would therefore use polling data collected before and after campaigns to evaluate their success in order to inform future campaigns, as well as Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) or other rigorous ways of evaluating the success of interventions. We would consult with expert scientists and medics in the initial design of such campaigns. Genetic engineering/Stem cell research Should Britain be at the forefront of research in these areas? What benefits do you believe such research will bring for society? Genetics and stem cell research show enormous potential for spurring advances in regenerative medicine, amongst other fields. Such work may be key to understanding and possibly treating diseases which blight people's lives, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as traumatic injuries. These have obvious direct benefits to society. But Britain's involvement and expertise in such research will also make us an international beacon for intellectual capital, enriching our research institutions and universities. We think this will inspire new generations of scientists to embark on careers in research, who will in turn make the medical and scientific breakthroughs of the future. This is a free vote issue but Lib Dem MPs overwhelmingly supported this research, while Conservative MPs voted overwhelmingly against allowing such research during the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act in 2008. Ben Goldacre: Pharmaceutical regulation Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture? Yes, they should. Studies have shown a publication bias whereby positive results of drugs trials are disproportionately represented. Public health depends on a good evidence-base, and a publication bias clearly skews that evidence-base. It is also in the interests of the pharmaceutical industry itself to be more and pro-actively transparent as the Vioxx episode shows. Pandemic readiness Do you believe the swine flu pandemic posed a significant risk to Britain? What action would your government take if a similar situation emerged in the future? Politicians are woefully under-qualified to judge whether a particular virus poses a threat to Britain. That is the job of expert scientific advisers. Our Government would work with domestic and international health organisations to follow the best available advice from scientists in any similar, future scenario. We reject the idea that if a worst case scenario does not come to pass then the advice or policy was wrong. These are difficult risk assessment judgements at a scientific and policy level."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2010/oct/11/twins-renewable-energy-space","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-10T23:05:05Z","webTitle":"Letters: Multiples choice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/oct/11/twins-renewable-energy-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2010/oct/11/twins-renewable-energy-space","fields":{"headline":"Multiples choice","bodyText":"It is truly remarkable that the government is giving any consideration to a plan which would emasculate the UK's renewable energy programme while protecting subsidies to coal and nuclear power (Spending cuts 'to cost 60,000 green jobs', 8 October).

Richard Buckley aka ricardorichardo: We need to concentrate on job creation One of the most depressing decisions taken by our new government in 2010 was to cancel an £80 million loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, the modern engineering firm poised to take a lead in the global nuclear power market. As well as providing hi-tech jobs in post-industrial Britain, Forgemasters would have boosted our export prospects and helped to rebalance a British economy that has become too dependent on low-skill, service-sector employment. It was a decision taken in the early days of the coalition, when the deficit hawks were most strident, and it is one that should be reversed by the supposedly progressive business secretary. Politically, it would help to dig Cable and his party out of their current hole, and economically it could be the starting point for an ambitious recovery programme. The financial crisis has shown the weakness of western nations that rely on credit and a service economy; bluntly, we need to make stuff that other people want, or need, to buy. The vital component for a nuclear power plant manufactured by Forgemasters should be an exemplar. At the fag end of New Labour, Gordon Brown rather desperately proposed investing in electric car technology. Why not? Britain has a genius for motor manufacturing, though the industry was mismanaged out of existence 40 years ago. Today's children may be the last to drive petrol-powered cars; why not use the shift in technology to regain a lost industry? Similarly, we are moving into a new era of energy supply, and as a wet and windy island on the edge of Europe, we should be leading the way in renewables. Who will pay for this recovery programme? We have a huge, state-owned financial sector, and in 2011 government must start directing its investments intelligently. Talha Ahmad aka Uttaran: We need to review our anti-terrorism policy The attacks on 9/11 and 7/7, and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and military activities in Pakistan and other places dominated the first decade of this century. Hundreds of thousands of lives lost, many thousands more injured. Torture, extra-judicial killing, rendition and questionable covert operations have become more common. At home, our government brought in a barrage of draconian legislations and initiatives such as Prevent. These measures were rushed through to gain popular support and positive tabloid coverage in defiance of established principles and fundamental rights. Consequently these measures created division, suspicion and mistrust between communities and the government. Terrorism and our response to it can, therefore, have a profound impact on the cohesiveness of our society, our national security and indeed global peace and stability. Thus it is the most important issue for our politics and politicians. A review of counter-terrorism strategies is a positive step. The government promise to let civil liberties and human rights prevail over anti-terror initiatives is refreshing. However, the anti-terror measures singled out the Muslim community. Gaining trust and support of this community must be a priority. This means government must engage with and listen to the diverse voices within the Muslim community, but must never seek to marginalise one group for another, or create favoured ones. The rise of fascists, the EDL and BNP, anti-Muslim bias in the media and within certain section of our society frightens the Muslim community. Our politicians and government must promote greater dialogue between faith and ethnic communities to raise awareness. To build confidence and make Muslim communities more resilient, the government must actively address the Muslim underachievement in education, employment and housing. Serious efforts must be made to understand and cater for the Muslim needs in schools, hospitals, job centres so that they are not left to struggle disproportionately more. This way the community will become more dynamic, economically productive and socially proactive and our society more cohesive. In the new year we must cherish the principle of freedom, respect and tolerance. Adam Thwaites aka Umami1979: We need to rethink parental leave British women, we are told, earn – on average – less than their male counterparts. Women in their 20s, on the other hand, are now earning more than their male peers. This 2.5% disparity is eliminated by the age of 30, and the decision to have children. It is likely that this cohort's progression into middle age will do much to mitigate the earnings differential between the sexes, but the impact of at least nine months' continued absence from the workplace will inevitably have a deleterious effect on women's immediate earning potential and subsequent career prospects. Nor is this effect is not restricted to women who choose motherhood. Employers' apparent reluctance to recruit women of child-bearing age, famously vocalised by Alan Sugar is providing a handicap to all women who happen to fit the demographic, regardless of their current or future plans for motherhood. What is the answer? Well, the government could do worse than to consider shared parental leave. Despite recent amendments, Britain still has one of the most unequal parental leave arrangements in Europe. This not only ensures inflexibility for new parents, but continues to deter fathers from taking their full entitlement, as it is largely without pay. The introduction of fully transferable parental leave would reduce the overall impact of women's absence from the workplace and, therefore, on pay and future career development. It would also go some way towards deterring recruiters' discrimination against young women, as the likelihood of men taking equal amounts of parental leave would increase significantly. Fathers would face a far more positive environment in which to request, and take, parental leave and would be able to play a far more active role in the raising of their children. The system may have an impact on male-dominated professions in the short-term, but the corollary of this is that it would subsequently lead to an increase in female participation in these fields. The usual cries of excessive profligacy and bureaucracy from the CBI should be minimised as the overall effect of this change to employers would be broadly cost-neutral; the total net leave entitlement would remain the same between parents. Andrew Chambers aka CiFAndrew: We need to reform the political system Fundamental political reform is one of the coalition's main ambitions for 2011. However these reforms will not change the fact that members of the Houses of Parliament are drawn from a narrow strand of society, which significantly fails to reflect the demographics of the wider electorate. The Houses of Parliament are a socially exclusive boys club made of rich, privately educated men drawn mostly from law, media or business. As a result, we have education plans dictated by former Etonians and public school alumni with no experience of the state sector, health policy dreamed up by millionaires who can afford the best in private treatments, and welfare reform under the influence of men who have no concept of what it is like to be unemployed. Reform of the House of Lords could provide the genuine social representation that our political system is lacking. An Athenian option would see the House of Lords populated by citizens with a selected cross-section of talents and life experiences. Policemen, teachers, NHS professionals and businessmen could take their place alongside people with experience of long-term unemployment, with mental health problems or with chronic disabilities. Representatives would be chosen through nomination to an independent panel – and would hold a single five-year salaried position. Moving towards a fully elected second chamber would simply replicate the narrow demographics of the House of Commons. This alternative would allow the second chamber to fulfil its intended role – that of apolitical oversight of government policy in the interests of the electorate. The most vulnerable groups in society; those on low incomes, those with mental illness and those with disabilities, also face the greatest hardship from the impending spending cuts. Therefore there can be no greater political priority than giving both a voice and real influence to the groups who are left marginalised by our current political system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/19/low-carbon-power-law","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-19T17:18:42Z","webTitle":"Energy firms could be forced to buy low-carbon power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/19/low-carbon-power-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/19/low-carbon-power-law","fields":{"headline":"Energy firms could be forced to buy low-carbon power","bodyText":"The government will next week signal a move towards the introduction of a \"low-carbon obligation\" that would force British Gas and other suppliers of energy to buy a percentage of their power from nuclear and clean coal plants. The radical measure – an extension of the renewable obligation that is funding wind farms – will appear in a document to be published alongside the budget next Wednesday. The idea of a low-carbon obligation has been championed by Paul Golby, the chief executive of E.ON UK, which wants to build new nuclear power stations but says they will not run commercially without a change to the market. The price of carbon was meant to rise through the European commission's emissions trading scheme (ETS), pushing up the price of oil, gas and coal and thus encourage greener technologies. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has considered imposing a floor on the carbon price – supported by some nuclear generators such as EDF of France – but critics believe it would be legally difficult to implement because it could interfere with the working of the ETS. Well-placed sources said there would be no hard recommendations contained in the energy market assessment to be published on budget day. It would instead reveal a \"narrowing of options\" that would give a clear indication about the way ministers were travelling. \"There is no hurry from industry to come up with a quick solution to how life will be as far out as 2050, just pressure to do the work thoroughly,\" said the source. Government thinking is now clearly different to that of the Conservatives over how to help nuclear without direct public subsidies, which both parties have ruled out. But a low-carbon obligation will still be seen as a backdoor subsidy by those opposed to nuclear, such as Greenpeace. The Tories said they were prepared to implement a floor on the carbon price and boasted there would be \"no limit\" on the number of nuclear plants they envisaged being built. Energy spokesman Greg Clark argued it was vital to provide energy security and combat climate change. \"This is a very clear statement that we are in favour of nuclear power,\" he said, arguing that a Conservative government hoped to preside over the opening of a new atomic power station every 18 months. But Simon Hughes, energy and climate change spokesman for the Lib Dems, said nuclear power required huge amounts of public money at a time when the taxpayer could least afford it.\"Blindly pledging to build a new nuclear plant every 18 months is a recipe for disaster,\" he said Industry figures were sceptical about whether it would be possible to deliver a massive pipeline of schemes, given planning constraints and shortages of skills and capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2011/may/24/ali-parsa-circle-healthcare-airline-747","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-24T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Ali Parsa: 'If healthcare was an airline, we are losing a 747 every month'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2011/may/24/ali-parsa-circle-healthcare-airline-747","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2011/may/24/ali-parsa-circle-healthcare-airline-747","fields":{"headline":"Ali Parsa: 'If healthcare was an airline, we are losing a 747 every month'","bodyText":"It's common to find people in a given industry, such as agriculture or the media, arguing that its products should cost more. Ali Parsa, the managing partner of private healthcare provider Circle, believes the opposite: that healthcare costs too much, certainly in the UK and in other rich countries. \"It's an unsustainable industry,\" he says. In his view, Britain has world class retailers, telecoms and financial services firms, as these sectors have been opened to competition over the past few decades. \"In each case, the change was dramatic and drastic,\" he says. \"We now need to do it to our public services in general, and healthcare in particular.\" The cost of the NHS has tripled in a decade, he adds, but \"you couldn't argue that clinical quality and outcomes have tripled over the last 10 years\". He doesn't blame managers, but systems which are too risk-averse, adding that healthcare organisations should be run like professional services firms, with individual practitioners given greater degrees of autonomy rather than chasing targets. What of the argument that healthcare, and in particular the NHS, is different? Parsa, who used to work as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, will have none of it. \"Every single industry that I banked, all had one thing in common – they all thought they were the most complex in the world,\" he says. Car manufacturing involves thousands of parts made just in time around the world. Bad healthcare can kill people, but bad airlines and nuclear power companies can kill far more. \"If healthcare was an airline, we are losing a 747 every month – the Americans are losing one every week – by the number of people who are unnecessarily dying in our industry. We have nothing like total quality control, we have nothing like the productivity and efficiency gains that other industries have.\" Held up in Huntingdon Staff at Hinchingbrooke hospital in Huntingdon may soon find themselves involved in putting Parsa's views to the test. Circle was due to take over the running of the trust on 1 June, in a deal proposed by the east of England strategic health authority last November, but last week the Department of Health delayed the signing of the management contract. \"This is an innovative arrangement so there is a need to carefully scrutinise it but we are making progress,\" said the department in a statement. Speaking before this pause was officially announced, Parsa said that \"everyone is frustrated\" by the delays to the deal, adding: \"It's sitting somewhere.\" If the deal for Circle to take over Hinchingbrooke's management goes through, employees will continue to be paid as NHS staff – but also receive free shares in the firm. \"In any organisation, ownership means control,\" Parsa explains, speaking at the organisation's headquarters just north of John Lewis's Oxford Street department store. Circle is often compared to the mutual retailer, but there are significant differences: while John Lewis is a formal partnership, Circle is a joint stock company, with half of its shares owned by financial backers and the other half owned by staff. Employees, including those at NHS trusts which are taken over by Circle, are awarded new shares each year based on their performance and seniority – but that also reduces the value of previously-issued staff shares ('diluted' in financial terminology). But Parsa says the practice provides a reason for staff to continue to work hard, and argues that 50% staff ownership means that \"I can never tell a doctor or a nurse not to do the right thing\". Despite the delays at Hinchingbrooke, Parsa is convinced that Circle can improve the trust's management and that of other healthcare providers - NHS, private or its own facilities - through improved decision making processes. He claims that committees, which decide most things in healthcare, go for the lowest common denominator, adding: \"We go with what we think is right.\" Dr Jonathan Boulton, clinical chair of Circle Bath – the firm's newly built hospital just south of that city – gives examples of anaesthetic kits and scanners. He says that typically clinical staff will ask for the most expensive equipment even if it is unnecessary, as a hedge against managers deciding to cut the cost. At Circle Bath, the clinical staff looked at options and decided they only needed a midrange scanner and anaesthetic kits, which do everything required. The presence of clinicians on the hospital's board meant they were likely to get exactly what they wanted, rather than have a request downgraded. Every little helps Parsa adds that Circle is developing skills in building high quality hospitals at a low price. Circle Bath – which resembles a boutique country hotel in its reception and accommodation areas – cost around £3,500 per square foot, compared he says with £5,000 for a typical NHS hospital. \"What we're very good at is asking how to make the money go a long way,\" he says. \"It's about looking at every pound and saying, does that work or doesn't it work?\" He adds that the firm is to build its new hospital in Reading – which he says will be \"identically beautiful\" to Bath's – at a cost of about £2,500 per square foot, learning lessons from the earlier hospital's construction. The firm has taken on a former construction manager for Tesco, used to putting up good quality buildings at a low price. Given the problems he sees with healthcare in the UK, it is striking that Parsa wants to run more NHS trusts, believing that the health service's existing staff can be motivated to bring about the revolution in efficiency he believes is necessary. \"There are three things that make you happy in your job. One is autonomy, two is complexity, and three is relativity of effort and rewards.\" He argues that the NHS has raised salaries but not in proportion to effort, reduced the complexity of people's jobs, and removed their their autonomy. \"We've paid them more, because we've failed to understand the psychology of work, we've completely made them miserable.

If it's him, his career will not have been made in Essex but ended there. And in its wake, a difficult game of personnel management begins. The energy secretary would be missed. For sure, he has irritated colleagues. It is quite neat that one of his many but most recent battles in government before the speeding incident was telling the transport secretary Philip Hammond he shouldn't raise the speed limit to 80mph (it burns more fuel, so isn't green). But he has made firm friends with international development secretary Andrew Mitchell – the pair often sit together in the chamber, dine together with partners and in cabinet speak up for each other when the other is embattled. They also have similar hair. They do. Contrary to the view that Nick Clegg can't wait to be shot of him, Huhne would also be missed by his boss. Gordon Brown had a white board on which he pinned MPs and moved them as he attempted to staff his government. Clegg's quota of five Liberal Democrat cabinet ministers are a given in the government, but Clegg is dissatisfied with his lot. His team feel that their current portfolios don't allow them to claim credit for the best things the coalition is doing. They can only bid for plum departments if, when the time comes, they have high-quality candidates to propose. Losing Huhne, however bumptious, wouldn't help them with this. When Cameron had to take the BSkyB portfolio from business secretary Vince Cable, he proposed Cable and Huhne do a straight swap. Cable turned it down on account of his having worked at Shell. The Tories and especially George Osborne would like junior Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne – a man so happy with coalition it had to be pointed out to civil servants in meetings that he wasn't a Tory – to go to energy. The Department for Energy and Climate Change could finish off a Lib Dem – despite a coalition pledge, the government are subsidising nuclear power, something that will become clear over the next few months. Surveying his own hypothetical white board, David Cameron has more of a problem than the five islands of yellow. Yes, he's got cabinet ministers and talent to chose from, but there is a pronounced personality split evident in his clan. Standing at his shoulder, Isaiah Berlin would describe the cabinet ministers who seem in rude health, sure of a job in cabinet come any reshuffle, as a skulk of foxes. \"The fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing,\" he wrote, quoting Archilochus, the very ancient Greek. \"There exists a great chasm,\" Berlin said, \"between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision, one system, less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel ... and those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way, for some psychological or physiological cause, related to no moral or aesthetic principle.\" Put like that you'd probably rather aspire to hedgehoggery than foxiness and the first year of coalition was indeed ruled by the hedgehogs, blinkered in their ministerial fiefdoms, driving through their intellectual visions. Andrew Lansley pursued competition in the NHS. Iain Duncan Smith rail-roaded through his welfare reforms. Ken Clarke's prisons policy was greeted with ecstatic cries. So relentless was her desire to cut costs that Caroline Spelman was one of the first to settle her department's spending budget in the comprehensive spending review. Michael Gove has been single-minded in pursuing his schools reforms. Steve Hilton is also a hedgehog. His constant refrain that it is all about \"getting Dave in the right place\", sums up the idea of focusing on one animating theme – the hedgehog world view. Foxes? Osborne may be hedgehogic in his push to get the deficit down, but around the fringes he is leading the go-slow on health reforms (which could eventually save the government money) because it is bad politics. Theresa May infuriates her fans because even when pressed she has no political ideology to speak of apart from \"what works\". She is positively hedgehog-like in her reifying of fox-like strategic expediency to reach her ends; Danny Alexander, the (Lib Dem) chief secretary to the treasury, signed off on the health reforms because he thought that was what he should do, but he is now opposed to the health reforms because that is now what his party has decided he should do. The key thing is that most foxes going into phase two of the coalition are still standing. OK, Gove is a hedgehog who has managed to cross the road. He was lampooned six months ago for going too far too fast but now he inches on his way with massive political support from the prime minister, his friend, and is lauded. But many hedgehogs have had or are beginning to have a bad time. There are signs that there are clouds over IDS's department. Lib Dem children's minister Sarah Teather has become so concerned by the conservative nature of IDS's family policy that she spends much of her time obstructing him and he is now trying to get responsibility for it transferred from her to his department. That's a hedgehog out of control. The hedgehogic problems with Lansley, Clarke, Fox, Spelman need little elucidation and it is possible they will lose their jobs for something less high profile. To which species David Cameron belongs is a question to which the answer constantly changes and that is in some ways right for a leader who must slip in and out of many guises. For some, Cameron is in a pronounced fox phase. They complain that under Osborne's influence, he has become too tactical rather than strategic. The Lib Dems ruefully get that the PM scored a tactical triumph over AV but warn that he has harmed his deputy so much that it was really a strategic blunder. Hilton questions the wisdom of Cameron's tactical retreat on the NHS. Unless Cameron watches it, the second year of the coalition could end up being the year of the fox. The need for single-minded vision could be over and the trait needed will be an ability to \"pursue many ends\". Cabinet ministers will thrive who can duck and dive as politics becomes all about coalition relationships: all about compromise, rather than the purity of the initial vision. It may now be politically desirable for Cameron to attempt the biologically impossible – to cross-breed the two types, presumably ending up with something like a porcupine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/may/09/climate-defining-green-moment-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-08T23:02:00Z","webTitle":"Climate change adviser warns of coming test for Cameron's green credentials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/09/climate-defining-green-moment-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/may/09/climate-defining-green-moment-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Climate change adviser warns of coming test for Cameron's green credentials","bodyText":"An imminent decision by David Cameron on climate change will be \"the key test\" of the government's green credentials, according to the UK's chief climate adviser, although squabbles among ministers mean it is a test that is in danger of being failed. Within the next two weeks, the cabinet must decide whether to accept the recommendations of its climate advisers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. However, several government departments, including the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department of Transport, are understood to be against approving the plan, which was proposed by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the statutory body set up to advise the government on global warming policy. The recommendations of the committee were accepted in full by the previous government, but Whitehall insiders warned that the advice was now in danger of being ignored. Cameron may have to step in personally to defuse a row that is threatening to tarnish the government's green credentials. David Kennedy, chief executive of the CCC, which was established under the Climate Change Act to advise on how to meet international global warming targets, told the Guardian in an interview: \"This [decision] is of crucial importance. It will be the key test of the government's commitment to the low-carbon agenda.\" Meg Hillier, shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"It is scarcely credible that ministers are considering rejecting the advice. To fail to act now on climate change will secure their place in history as the least green government of our times.\" The government has already backed down once from a serious attack on the CCC, when a proposal to repeal the Climate Change Act was first mooted then rejected. But ministers are still under fire over green commitments made a year ago, when Cameron pledged this would be \"the greenest government ever\". A report published at the weekend by Friends of the Earth, drawn up by the veteran environmentalist Jonathon Porritt, described the likelihood of the government living up to its environmental promise as \"vanishingly remote\", and judged that many policies had been \"delayed, watered down or abandoned\". The report examined 77 green policies, and found little or no progress in more than three-quarters of them. Soundings taken by the Guardian also suggest that many investors, green entrepreneurs and even Tory MPs doubt the government's commitment to green policies. Kennedy's warning that this is a key test of the government's policies came as the CCC told MPs that renewable energy could make up 40% of the UK's energy mix by 2030, with a similar amount coming from nuclear reactors, and most of the remainder from coal or gas power stations fitted with carbon capture and storage technology. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world's leading climate scientists convened by the United Nations, is also expected to publish a report on renewable energy that will show that the world can avoid dangerous levels of global warming by investing in renewable energy sources, including wind and solar power. Kennedy said he was confident that nuclear power could make up 40% of the UK's future energy mix, despite the high-profile problems in Japan, where the Fukushima plant has been leaking radioactivity, and another is due to be closed. He said: \"There is no obvious implication for the UK from Fukushima. Japan is more vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis, and the age of the reactor [Fukushima was built in the early 1970s] was a big factor.\" Green groups rejected this analysis, however. Keith Allott, head of climate change at WWF, said: \"Unfortunately, the government and the Committee on Climate Change are basing their assumptions on highly optimistic and theoretical nuclear cost estimates . Given the industry's history of massive cost overruns – now being repeated with new reactors in France and Finland – the view that nuclear is more cost-effective than renewables is highly contentious. The recent disaster in Japan and associated safety reviews can only lead to a further hike in nuclear costs and greater public opposition to new reactors and the government needs to urgently switch its focus to the renewables solution.\" The comments came as Unicef, the children's organisation, called for a \"Robin Hood\" tax to raise money to combat climate change. Renewed hope Renewable energy could more than meet the expected growth in the world's needs, with solar power holding out the greatest hope, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the UN-convened body, consisting of the world's leading climate scientists. The report marks the first time the IPCC has examined low-carbon energy in depth, and the first interim report since the body's comprehensive 2007 review of the science of climate change. Although the authors are optimistic, theynote that many forms of the technology are more expensive than fossil fuels, and renewable energy will have to increase to as much as 20 times its current level to avoid dangerous global warming. Renewables will play a greater role than nuclear or carbon capture and storage, the scientists predict. About 13% of the world's energy came from renewable sources in 2008, a proportion likely to have risen as countries have built up their capacity since, with China leading the investment surge, particularly in wind energy. By far the current greatest source of renewable energy is burning biomass, which can cause deforestation and accelerate global warming, and cooking fires which cause indoor air pollution that harms health. • The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday 10 May 2011. Noting that the cabinet must soon decide whether to accept recommendations from the advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) about cutting greenhouse gas emissions, an article said that this statutory body foresaw nuclear reactors producing about 40% of the UK's energy mix by 2030. That should have been 40% of the mix of sources for UK electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/16/britain-urging-citizens-leave-tokyo","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T21:49:18Z","webTitle":"Britain joins countries urging their citizens to leave Tokyo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/britain-urging-citizens-leave-tokyo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/16/britain-urging-citizens-leave-tokyo","fields":{"headline":"Britain joins countries urging their citizens to leave Tokyo","bodyText":"Britain France, Italy and Australia urged their nationals to get out of the capital, amid fears that a radioactive cloud could spread from the stricken nuclear reactors on Japan's earthquake and tsunami-hit north-east coast. As panic spread to China and Russia, where shoppers stocked up on gauze masks and chemists sold out of iodine tablets to treat radiation sickness, the Foreign Office issued advice to any British nationals in Tokyo or to its north to consider leaving the area because of the \"evolving situation\" at the Fukushima nuclear plant and potential disruptions to the supply of goods, transport, communications and power. Radiation levels in Tokyo were 10 times above normal levels at one point, but not a health threat, officials said. But a number of foreign companies were reported to be preparing contingency plans for their international staff in Japan, and private jet firms said they were being inundated with requests for evacuation flights. Last night, roads and trains out of Tokyo were crowded as residents sought to flee the capital. About 185 French citizens, including priority cases such as children and pregnant women, arrived in Paris on an emergency government jet. The French embassy in Tokyo said it had asked Air France to mobilise further planes for the evacuation of its nationals, and two were already on their way. \"It seems reasonable to advise that those who have no particular reason to stay in the Tokyo region leave … for a few days,\" it said in an email to its citizens. \"It's difficult because we had to leave our relatives,\" one French man said. \"My wife is Japanese and we had to leave her family behind, and as you all know the situation in not good in terms of nuclear safety. We are not demoralised, but it was hard for us.\" Serbia and Croatia also advised their citizens to leave, with the latter joining Austria in moving its embassy to the western city of Osaka. In Russia's eastern regions, distrust of officials playing down radiation dangers after Chernobyl reportedly led to a rise in sales of dosimeters, which measure radiation exposure, iodine and face masks. Officials blamed profiteers for stirring fears to boost sales. Flights from the far east of Russia to Moscow sold out, airlines said. \"Some people are just freaking out,\" Pyotr Laduzhin, a computer engineer in Vladivostok, told Associated Press. \"It's an old Soviet fear of a nuclear attack.\" Italy's foreign ministry said it was working with Alitalia to evacuate Italians while Australia urges its citizens with non-essential roles to consider leaving Tokyo and the most damaged prefectures. Turkey warned its citizens against travelling to Japan. Earlier, the British embassy in Tokyo said it was doing everything it could to evacuate British citizens from the zone most seriously hit by the earthquake and tsunami. Foreign office minister Jeremy Browne said: \"We are in the process of doing everything we can to identify potential casualties and to help people who are in the disaster zone, but have survived and want to get out.\" \"The situation there is pretty chaotic in terms of transport and communications, but we are keen to identify people and keen to help people. \"There aren't that many British people in the disaster zone asking for our assistance. We've had staff going round hospitals and elsewhere trying to contact all the British people we can.\" The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it was preparing to send buses to remove its nationals from Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki and Iwate prefectures, the provinces hit hardest. Beijing has estimated it has more than 22,000 citizens in the affected areas and China Southern Airlines said it would fly in larger planes to handle demand for evacuation to China. BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered and Morgan Stanley are among the banks whose employees have left Tokyo since last Friday, and there are reports that thousands of people have asked private jet companies to arrange evacuation flights. Blackstone, the world's largest private equity firm, reportedly closed its Tokyo office for a week and offered its 28 employees there relocation, although most major financial firms in the city plan to stay open. The Indian software services company L&amp;T Infotech ordered the temporary evacuation of 185 employees and their family members. The firm said it had chartered a special Kingfisher Airlines flight that will leave for Chennai in India on Friday. Meanwhile, 500 bone marrow transplant centres across 27 European countries have been put on alert to treat nuclear power station workers whose lives may be threatened in the battle to avoid a meltdown. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation offered to treat 200 to 300 patients if necessary. \"After a person has been radiated, you have three to four days before they're on the cusp of severe complications,\" said Ray Powles, chair of its nuclear accident committee. Radiation kills bone marrow cells, which can lead to a compromised immune system in patients."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2011/feb/03/stephen-fry-shelves-japan-filming","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-03T14:29:40Z","webTitle":"Stephen Fry shelves filming in Japan after atomic bomb jokes outcry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/03/stephen-fry-shelves-japan-filming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2011/feb/03/stephen-fry-shelves-japan-filming","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Fry shelves filming in Japan after atomic bomb jokes outcry","bodyText":"Stephen Fry has abruptly shelved plans to film in Japan for a forthcoming BBC series, following an outcry over jokes made on his quiz show QI about a man who survived both of the atomic bombings. Fry, the show's host, was due to arrive in Japan earlier this week to film Planet Word, which will explore the link between language and manga, mobile phones and other media, and explain how young Japanese are transforming their mother tongue. The author and TV presenter, who is currently filming in Singapore, sparked controversy after describing Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as \"the unluckiest man in the world\" in an episode of QI broadcast in December. Roland Kelts, an authority on Japanese pop culture who was to accompany Fry in Tokyo, said he had been told that filming would not go ahead \"due to ongoing threats against Stephen Fry, even after official apologies were offered and the [Japanese and British] embassies became involved\". Kelts, author of Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the US, added: \"The producers had to scramble for an alternative, presumably Asian, location.\" The British embassy in Tokyo said it was not aware of any threats directed at Fry or his production company Sprout Pictures. As the controversy unfolded last month, Fry wrote on Twitter: \"I'm coming to Japan the week after next as it happens, and I'll certainly let my regret known [sic](if they let me in!)\". A spokeswoman in the Tokyo office of BBC Worldwide, which promotes the corporation's content for the overseas market, said she was not in a position to discuss the controversy. Sprout Pictures in London did not respond to requests for comment. The Guardian understands, however, that executives at BBC Worldwide in Tokyo had voiced doubts about the merits of filming in Japan so soon after the QI furore. Kelts said he was disappointed that Japan would not feature in the five-part series, which, according to the BBC, will span locations including Hong Kong, Sydney, Israel, Kenya, Tanzania and Malaysia. \"Naturally, it's not worth risking injury or worse to shoot a TV documentary on language and culture,\" Kelts said. \"But I do think it's a shame that the project was scuttled over what to me seems a fairly minor and innocuous misunderstanding.\" Yamaguchi, who died of cancer last year aged 93, was on business in Hiroshima when it was destroyed by an atomic bomb on 6 August 1945. An estimated 80,000 people were killed instantly, and another 60,000 died in the months that followed. After spending a night in Hiroshima, Yamaguchi was able to travel by train back to his home town, Nagasaki. That city was bombed on 9 August as Yamaguchi was explaining his earlier brush with death to his boss. Fry said: \"Well, this man is either the unluckiest or the luckiest, it depends which way you look at it.\" He voiced amazement that Yamaguchi had been able to use public transport so soon after the attack, prompting panellists to poke fun at Britain's train services, including a joke about \"the wrong kind of bomb [on the tracks]\". Alan Davies wondered if the bomb had fallen on Yamaguchi's head, adding: \"He never got the train again, I tell you.\" Fellow panellist Rob Brydon quipped: \"Is the glass half empty, is it half full? Either way it's radioactive. So don't drink it.\" The exchange prompted a complaint from the Japanese embassy in London, which accused QI of making light of the bombings. Yamaguchi's eldest daughter said Britain, as a nuclear power, had no right to \"look down\" on her father. The BBC and production company Talkback Thames apologised, saying: \"We are sorry for any offence caused. QI never sets out to cause offence with any of the people or subjects it covers. \"However, on this occasion, given the sensitivity of the subject matter for Japanese viewers, we understand why they did not feel it appropriate for inclusion in the programme.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/aug/09/coalition-split-boycott-school-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-09T21:15:09Z","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats call for boycott of flagship free schools","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/09/coalition-split-boycott-school-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/aug/09/coalition-split-boycott-school-policy","fields":{"headline":"Liberal Democrats call for boycott of flagship free schools","bodyText":"The coalition is heading for a potentially damaging split on education as Liberal Democrats prepare at their conference next month to urge parents not to send their children to Michael Gove's flagship free schools, describing them as \"socially divisive, likely to depress education outcomes and an inefficient use of resources in an age of austerity\". The move will be the lead education motion at the conference. Published today, the motion warns that such schools will add to \"the multiple tiers and types of schools created by successive Conservative and Labour governments, and thus abandon our key goal of a high quality education system for all learners\". The schools motion urges the coalition to revise its support for academy schools, warning that local authorities should retain oversight of places in all schools in receipt of any state funding. Lib Dem concern over the impact on inequality of spending cuts is also expressed in other motions published today. The party conference in Liverpool, the first the Lib Dems have held while in power, is expected to draw up to 6,000 people and will be watched with a degree of seriousness not usually attached to the proceedings of the third party of politics. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, is expected to receive a hero's welcome despite the party's recent slide in the opinion polls, but will be leaving the conference early to attend the United Nations conference on the millennium development goals in New York. The party is particularly losing support in the north and among young voters. Although unease will be expressed on the conference fringe over the direction of the coalition, and over specific policies on the main conference floor, senior party figures believe the mood will be upbeat. In a sign of nerves at the impact the austerity programme may have on the party's commitment to fairness, one motion also calls for the Office for Budget Responsibility to be made truly independent, and for its remit to include assessing the socio-economic impact of Treasury policy, as stipulated in the Equality Act 2010. It also calls for ministers to be \"given freedom and resources to commission research to fully assess the viability and practicality of increasing taxation on wealth – including land values\". The conference will demand tighter terms of reference for an inquiry into British involvement in US torture of alleged terrorist suspects. The motion claims the purpose of the inquiry will be undermined if the findings are not made public. It is also due to call for a shake up of the Press Complaints Commission with the removal of senior editors from the PCC board, in line with the recommendations of a recent inquiry by the culture and media select committee. The motion says \"a regulator should be entirely independent of serving editors, and should have the power to take disciplinary action, including financial penalties, against editors who breach the code\". The culture committee investigated complaints that Andy Coulson, No 10 director of communications, had been aware of illegal phone interception when he was News of the World editor. The select committee found the PCC had not investigated the allegations with sufficient seriousness, which the PCC disputes. A motion broadly supporting the direction of the coalition's energy policies warns against \"changes to the carbon price that result in windfall benefits to the operators of existing nuclear power stations\". Energy secretary Chris Huhne again promised today there would be no hidden or clear subsidy for nuclear power. Disagreements over coalition education policy could be the most contentious individual policy issue. The motion says free schools create surplus places prejudicial to efficient use of resources. It suggests they will increase social divisions \"when all efforts should be focused on improving educational outcomes by enabling effective teaching and learning to take place in good local schools accessible to all\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2010/nov/09/hugh-richards-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-09T18:27:02Z","webTitle":"Hugh Richards obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/09/hugh-richards-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2010/nov/09/hugh-richards-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Hugh Richards obituary","bodyText":"Hugh Richards, an ardent anti-nuclear activist, who has died from bone marrow cancer aged 65, had a gentle, understated manner that masked fierce determination and a wonderful dry wit. Born in Cardiff, he trained as both an architect (gaining a first from Cardiff University, and meeting his wife, Mag) and a town planner (at Sheffield University). His work as a planner for Liverpool council in the early 1970s drew him into environmentalism. After a few years in London, he and Mag moved back to Wales in 1976, to start a family and live a more sustainable lifestyle. The first big British set-piece nuclear public inquiry at Windscale (Sellafield) coincided with this move, and soon Hugh became embroiled in opposition to nuclear power. With other, like-minded activists, he established the Central Wales Energy Group and later the Welsh Anti-Nuclear Alliance (WANA). He was also involved in the setting up of the Nuclear Free Local Authorities movement in 1980. By 1988 he was becoming frustrated with the limited time he had to dedicate to the anti-nuclear cause, so he and Mag agreed that he would become a \"house father\", spending his spare time on campaigning. He simultaneously set up in private practice as a planning and design consultant. Indeed he designed the home where Billy and Tom, his two sons with severe learning difficulties, live as part of the Ashfield Community Enterprise (ACE), in Powys. Hugh and his younger brother, Tim, used to joke that he had a truly \"anti-nuclear\" family. Hugh was a tireless campaigner for causes that he believed to be right, not just on environmental issues, but also around the rights of people with learning difficulties. He was a candidate for the Green party in the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency in the 1992 general election. Perhaps his greatest campaign victory was to persuade the Welsh Assembly environment minister, Jane Davidson, in August last year, to support WANA's call for a public inquiry into proposed nuclear new build in Wales. Hugh himself was called as an expert witness at a number of nuclear public inquiries, which is where I first met him, two decades ago. His most important contribution was work on spent fuel management and so-called \"high burn-up\" nuclear fuel for new reactor designs. He painstakingly demonstrated that the nuclear industry's plans for long-term management of new-build wastes are unsustainable. Hugh is survived by Mag, Billy, Tom and Tim."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/may/27/edf-nuclear-huhne","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-26T23:05:04Z","webTitle":"EDF Energy to press ahead with nuclear plans after receiving assurances from Chris Huhne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/27/edf-nuclear-huhne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/may/27/edf-nuclear-huhne","fields":{"headline":"EDF to press ahead with nuclear plans after assurances from Chris Huhne","bodyText":"EDF Energy will announce today that it has received sufficient reassurances from the energy and climate change secretary, Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne, to continue planning for a new generation of nuclear plants in Britain. There were fears that the Lib Dems' manifesto commitment to halt the construction of any more nuclear reactors, and recent sceptical signals from Huhne, could derail its £20bn building programme. But Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF in Britain, will tell a conference he is convinced that both sides are committed to the same goal: new reactors without subsidies and at a viable cost. \"What has emerged very quickly from the coalition government is clarity over its commitment to deliver a low carbon future, together with a commitment that new nuclear will play a part in the new administration's plans,\" de Rivaz will say. \"Chris Huhne … has already provided important reassurances that he will take a pragmatic approach to new nuclear power as long as it can be built without subsidy. \"The commitments from the coalition government envisage a proper role for nuclear and have reassured us at EDF, as we contemplate the very serious investment we are proposing to make in nuclear power in the UK,\" he will add in a speech to the Global Energy Capital Market Conference in London. EDF says it has been particularly pleased by comments about the introduction of a floor to the carbon price plus a commitment to speed up the planning regime for new energy infrastructure through a clear national policy statement. The company, an arm of the huge, largely state-owned, French utility EDF, insists that it is happy to build new reactors without otherwise relying on any handouts from the Treasury, even for waste or decommissioning. EDF wants to build four new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk that would generate enough power to light 40% of Britain's homes or the equivalent of 13% of all UK electricity, but the final decision on whether to proceed is not due to be taken until 2011. \"We've made it clear to the prime minister and the secretary of state for energy and climate change that EDF Energy will spearhead the nuclear renaissance in the UK without the need for public subsidy. That is important to the government. It is important for us,\" de Rivaz will say. \"We operate in a market where the costs for waste and decommissioning are met by nuclear operators through an independently assessed, ring-fenced fund, a requirement further underpinned in this year's Energy Act … Together with other operators we will continue to make regular payments into those funds, to protect ordinary creditors against any associated prospective costs.\" De Rivaz says that latest public opinion polls show growing support for nuclear power even from Lib Dem supporters, who have traditionally been among the most negative towards it. And he will quote from a new report published by Parsons Brinckerhoff Power that suggests power can be generated much more cheaply by nuclear than by competing technologies. \"Their data shows that with typical generation costs in the range of £55-£86 per megawatt hour [MWh], new nuclear is well placed in helping keep low carbon energy affordable in the long term,\" he will say. \"That compares particularly favourably to other low carbon technologies. Offshore wind represents a generating cost of up to £204 per MWh and carbon capture and storage technology up to £154 per MWh.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jan/13/green-investment-bank-build-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-13T10:13:43Z","webTitle":"Green investment bank could help to build nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/13/green-investment-bank-build-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jan/13/green-investment-bank-build-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Green investment bank could help to build nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The government's Green Investment Bank could fund the building of new nuclear reactors, it has emerged. It is the latest form of public financial support on offer to the industry from the government which continues to insist that the industry will not receive any more subsidies. The Conservatives' pre-election manifesto promised that the Green Investment Bank – which was also in the coalition agreement – would finance \"new green technology start-ups\". But documents issued before Christmas by Vince Cable's business department list new reactors, along with offshore wind farms and new electricity grids, as one of the three proposed \"target sectors\" on which the bank would initially focus. Justine Greening MP, the economic secretary to the Treasury, appeared before the Commons environmental audit committee yesterday and denied that financial backing from a publicly funded bank would amount to a subsidy for the nuclear power industry. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who sits on the committee, said: \"Nuclear is not green in my view. But it's not new in anyone's mind. Funding nuclear makes a mockery of the whole idea of a Green Investment Bank and even indirect support – such as cheaper taxpayer-backed loans offered by a bank – still amounts to a subsidy.\" Greening also dodged questions about whether the bank would be able to make billions of pounds of cheap loans or act as a more limited fund. The Treasury is concerned that borrowings would add to the government's deficit. \"I am not going to be hung up on semantics,\" she told the committee, telling them that a decision had not yet been made and that there were also other ways to encourage green investment. She also refused to be drawn on how much more effective a fully functional bank would be in encouraging the estimated £450bn investment needed by 2025 for the UK to meet ambitious carbon reduction and environmental targets. Senior coalition sources said civil servants who wrote the documents decided to include nuclear as a low carbon form of generation that could potentially receive funding in order to be thorough. They had not been instructed to do so by ministers, it is understood. A spokesman for the business department insisted that no final decision had been made on whether the Green Investment Bank would provide financial support for the nuclear industry. If it did, it would add to a growing list of government help for the industry, including guarantees of a minimum carbon floor price, caps on nuclear waste liabilities and a possible new \"low-carbon obligation\" which would guarantee a higher price for the electricity reactors generate. In an interview with the Guardian last month, Chris Huhne, the energy and climate change secretary, maintained that there will be no \"support specific for nuclear for the very simple reason that it is an old and mature technology\". He added: \"The economic rationale for providing extra subsidy for something relies on it being an infant technology which has not come yet to commercial scale.\" Greening said that the model for a Green Investment Bank should be decided by May and that it would be operational in 2012. Ernst &amp; Young estimates that traditional sources of capital such as energy companies and infrastructure finance could only provide up to £80bn of the £450bn investment needed by 2025, arguing that only a fully operational bank can fill the gap. Huhne, who together with environmentalists is pushing for a bank which can borrow and lend, admitted last month that\" a fully fledged bank will take time to set up\" particularly given the coalition's overriding priority of cutting the deficit. He suggested the idea that the bank could initially start off in a more limited capacity to kick-start investment as soon as possible but insisted that he wanted a bank set up as soon as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/14/germany-green-birkenstock-biggest-stage","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T22:00:00Z","webTitle":"Germany's future is Green | Cem Özdemir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/germany-green-birkenstock-biggest-stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/14/germany-green-birkenstock-biggest-stage","fields":{"headline":"Germany's future is Green","bodyText":"'It's not that easy being green,\" Kermit the frog once sang. Conservatives have tradition, social democrats the welfare state and liberals boundless individualism. But the Greens have little to offer besides dialogue, strain and responsibility. So what is going on in Germany? In 2009's national elections, the Greens reached an all-time high with 10.7%, and are currently getting ratings of between 15% and 25% in the polls. This minority coalition partner is now competing for top spot in such completely different states as Berlin, the traditionally leftist (and bankrupt) capital in the north-east, and the conservative economic powerhouse Baden-Württemberg in the south-west. The threat of nuclear disaster in Japan has moved the issue of nuclear power right back to the top of the agenda. Even Angela Merkel has admitted that the calamity of Fukishima Daiichi is \"a turning point for the world\". Her government's nuclear record is damning: it decided to delay a nuclear energy phaseout negotiated by the Greens, in order to line the pockets of the big four energy suppliers. We are opposing this \"phaseout of the phaseout\" because it is written on our birth certificate that we are against nuclear energy. But the Greens' success is the result of a wider shift in the German mentality. The country has begun to shed its fear of change: gone is the belief that in the end the Deutsche mark, Helmut Kohl and the church do it best. Confidence in political parties and democratic institutions is diminishing, and turnout at elections, though high in comparison to other democracies, is shrinking. This does not mean people are ignorant. On the contrary, they want to get involved. They demand direct participation, especially when it comes to huge infrastructure projects such as Stuttgart 21, the city's old railway station going underground at a cost of €8bn. People give the Greens credit for bottom-up politics, transparency and an immunity to cronyism, and research shows the party has won over many non-voters. Under the technocratic rule of Chancellor Merkel, the conservative CDU has failed to become a modern, urban, more female party. The Greens have capitalised, attracting voters who would probably not have supported the \"Birkenstock Greens\" of 20 years ago. Where the Greens have learned to balance ideals and pragmatism, Merkel's CDU has neglected its own values and failed to offer the country direction. Merkel may be the queen of small steps – but the Green party is the princess of the future. The Greens have also profited from the disastrous strategy of the Social Democrats to cling to the \"third way politics\" beloved of Gerhard Schröder. Millions of voters have deserted the party, with the young and progressive coming over to the Greens or none. We have also benefited from demographic change: as well as young voters, we can now draw on an older voter base, as the over-70s turn their backs on other parties. Time is on the side of the green movement. Environmental awareness is growing. Green has become a conscious lifestyle choice – eating organic food, using public transport, buying energy from renewables, consuming from small shops, ethical banking in ethical banks. Last year, the German Greens celebrated their 30th birthday. It is worth reminding people of the extent to which the party has influenced public opinion in those three decades. Founded above all as an anti-nuclear party, the Greens have helped to generate a new consensus about gender balance, party democracy, renewable energy, genetically modified food, consumer rights and new family models. But the Greens have also changed. Starting as a heterogeneous bunch of idealistic non-parliamentarians, they have become a solid parliamentary force and a responsible partner in government coalitions. In the past, surveys show, people liked the Greens but didn't vote for them because they feared the party wouldn't have the brain and muscle to run the country. This perception has changed over the last few years. The key to understanding our growth is Nicholas Stern's simple rationale: getting green will be costly, but not getting green will cause a collapse. The German Greens realised early on that the economy is both the problem and the solution – and therefore can get green and grow. Stern, who led the UN review on the economics of climate change, the Nobel prizewinning economist Paul Krugman and others have made it clear that you must get green to grow – hence the German Greens' call for a \"Green New Deal\" to transform the financial sector, economy, labour market and sustainability. \"Green is the new red, white and blue,\" the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote in 2007. The movement's values are relevant to everyone. Smaller Green parties, like America's, can find this overwhelming. Here in Germany, however, the Greens are prepared to take on bigger responsibilities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/10/royal-navy-nuclear-submarine-reactor-flaws","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-10T09:05:12Z","webTitle":"Flaws in nuclear submarine reactors could be fatal, secret report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/10/royal-navy-nuclear-submarine-reactor-flaws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/10/royal-navy-nuclear-submarine-reactor-flaws","fields":{"headline":"Flaws in nuclear submarine reactors could be fatal, secret report warns","bodyText":"The reactors that power Britain's naval submarines are \"potentially vulnerable\" to fatal nuclear accidents because they fail to meet modern safety standards, according to a heavily censored report declassified by the Ministry of Defence. The MoD's senior nuclear safety expert warns that the safety of submarine reactors compares \"poorly\" with that of nuclear power stations, and there could be dangerous leaks of radioactivity. There was also a risk of \"multiple fatalities\" from submarines failing to surface, he says. Yet the reactors are being installed in a new £10bn fleet of Astute submarines. And they are still under consideration for the submarines due to replace those that carry Trident nuclear missiles from 2028. The report, released under freedom of information law and passed to Channel 4 News, also reveals that arguments over the reactor designs have delayed decisions on replacing Trident by 18 months, and added more than £260m to the bill. The report is a submission made to the Defence Board, a senior decision-making body within the MoD, in November 2009 about the status of plans to replace Trident submarines. It includes a damning assessment of the safety of current submarine reactors by the MoD's senior nuclear safety regulator, Commodore Andrew McFarlane. \"Current UK practice falls significantly short of benchmarked relevant good practice,\" he warns. The pressurised water reactors that run submarines are \"potentially vulnerable to a structural failure of the primary circuit\". This could cause \"a release of highly radioactive fission products\" and \"a significant risk to life to those in close proximity and a public safety hazard out to 1.5km from the submarine\", McFarlane says. \"Current designs of UK and global civil power plants have systems for safety injection of coolant into the reactor pressure vessel head and passive core cooling systems,\" he adds. \"UK submarines compare poorly with these benchmarks, with the ability to tolerate only a structural failure equivalent to a …\" Unfortunately the rest of the sentence, along with most of the following two pages, are blacked out in the released document. McFarlane, who retired as head of the MoD's internal Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator in 2009, also suggests reactor problems could stop submarines from surfacing. There was a \"risk of multiple fatalities resulting from loss of depth control\", he says. The Royal Navy operates 11 nuclear-powered submarines, including six old Trafalgar class and four Vanguard class, which carry Trident missiles. It has also launched HMS Astute, the first of seven Astute class submarines being built at Barrow in Cumbria. The Astute programme, which could end up costing more than £10bn, has been plagued with delays and cost overruns. HMS Astute itself suffered embarrassment in October when it accidently ran aground near the Isle of Skye during trials. The MoD is also trying to decide on the type of reactor to drive the submarines destined to replace the Vanguards. The declassified MoD document discloses that there are several options still under consideration. One, known as PWR2, is \"essentially\" similar to the Astute class, while another, PWR2b, has \"significantly modified systems to improve platform safety and survivability\". A third, PWR3, is described as a \"new propulsion plant based on a US design but using UK reactor technology\". Uncertainty over which reactor to choose has delayed a crucial investment decision about Trident, known as \"initial gate\", by at least 18 months. The decision was originally due to be made in September 2009, but has still not been announced by the MoD. The delay incurred \"additional funding\" of nearly £261m, the document says. It also meant that \"substantial interest can be expected from parliament and elements of the media\" that would require \"presentational handling\". John Large, the consulting nuclear engineer who helped oversee the salvage of the stricken Russian submarine, Kursk, after it sank in August 2000, said the document revealed \"very serious shortcomings\" in the present generation of submarine reactors. \"These include doubts about the survivability of the submarine after a nuclear reactor malfunction, lack of a passive shut-down system, and strong hints that the reactor plant could fail when subject to what should be tolerable levels of hostile action.\" John Ainslie, the co-ordinator of the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, who obtained the document from the MoD, called on the government to scrap the Trident replacement programme. \"There is a serious risk that there will be a nuclear accident which will expose the crew and members of the public to lethal levels of radiation,\" he said. An MoD spokesman said: \"The MoD takes nuclear safety very seriously. All of our nuclear reactors meet the strict safety standards set by the DNSR and we continuously look for areas of improvement.\" • This story is to be broadcast on Channel 4 News at 7pm on Thursday 10 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/sep/21/edf-possible-british-energy-sale","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-21T17:37:42Z","webTitle":"EDF 'looking to sell another 20% stake' in British Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/21/edf-possible-british-energy-sale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/sep/21/edf-possible-british-energy-sale","fields":{"headline":"EDF 'looking to sell another 20% stake' in British Energy","bodyText":"EDF, the French group hoping to lead the nuclear \"renaissance\" in the UK, is looking to offload another 20% stake in British Energy, according to a report in France.

Officials said the negligible radioactivity levels near the plants in Fukushima prefecture posed no threat to human health. Screening centres were being set up for people worried about exposure. Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco] described the situation at the Fukushima No 1 power plant as an emergency after the cooling system failed at a second reactor at the plant. Tepco said radiation levels at the plant had exceeded the legal limit on Sunday morning. Hourly radiation at the site was measured at 882 microsievert, in excess of the allowable level of 500, Japan's nuclear safety agency said. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the level had briefly risen to 1,204 microsievert. \"There was no sudden rise in radiation because of the ventilation activities,\" Edano said, adding that there was no immediate threat to human health. \"We are doing the two things at the same time - venting air out of the reactor and supplying water into the reactor,\" he told reporters. As authorities released steam to relieve pressure from the second overheating reactor, efforts were under way to evacuate 210,000 people living within 12 miles of the two plants. Among those waiting to leave was Reiko Takagi, who lives in Iwaki, about 18 miles from the No 1 plant. \"Everyone wants to get out of the town. But the roads are terrible,\" she said. \"It is too dangerous to go anywhere. But we are afraid that winds may change and bring radiation toward us.\" Edano said: \"There is no confusion at this point, although we appreciate that people will have to leave their homes and livelihoods behind, but there is no panic.\" Efforts were also under way to cool off three reactors at the firm's No 2 nuclear plant at Fukushima, about 150 miles north of Tokyo. The complete failure of more cooling systems has added an additional level of danger to what was already one of the worst nuclear accidents in Japan's history. The government has classed the accident as level 4 on an international scale of levels 0-7. At least 22 people are known to have been exposed to radiation and are being treated in hospital, but Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency said that up to 160 people may have been exposed. Tepco confirmed that the No 3 reactor of the quake-hit No 1 Fukushima plant had lost its cooling functions. A small amount of radiation leaked on Saturday after similar problems hit the facility's No 1 reactor. Nineteen people have been exposed to radioactivity today; three more were exposed when the roof over the No 1 reactor exploded on Saturday. Tepco said the No 1 reactor had partly melted - the first time this has happened in Japan - and was continuing efforts to cool the reactor with seawater, a procedure a British nuclear expert described as \"an act of desperation\". The company notified the government on Sunday morning that the No 3 reactor had lost the ability to cool the reactor core, and that radioactive steam was being released. Kyodo News quoted Tepco as saying that up to three metres (10ft) of fuel rods were exposed above water at the plant. Shaun Burnie, an independent nuclear energy consultant and former head of nuclear campaigns at Greenpeace, said the presence of a percentage of fuel core loaded with plutonium Mox fuel in the No 3 reactor posed a grave threat to the surrounding area. \"Plutonium Mox fuel increases the risk of nuclear accident due the neutronic effects of plutonium on the reactor,\" Burnie told the Guardian. \"In the event of an accident - in particular loss of coolant - the reactor core is more difficult to control due to both neutronics and higher risk of fuel cladding failure. In the event of the fuel melting and the release of plutonium fuel into the environment, the health hazards are greater, including higher levels of latent cancer.\" The Mox fuel was delivered in 1999 and was loaded into the reactor by Tepco only last year after sitting in Fukushima storage ponds amid opposition and delays from the prefecture's governor, Burnie said. The No 3 reactor is the sixth facing risks because of loss of cooling water since Friday's devastating quake and tsunami. Tepco last night filled the No 1 reactor with seawater and boric acid to prevent criticality - an uncontrolled nuclear reaction - hours after an explosion blew away the roof and walls of a building housing the reactor. The blast is thought to have occurred when hydrogen being released from the reactor mixed with oxygen either in the air or in cooling water."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2008/sep/22/johnhutton.labourconference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-22T08:17:26Z","webTitle":"Hutton makes case for coal and nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/johnhutton.labourconference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/sep/22/johnhutton.labourconference","fields":{"headline":"Hutton makes case for coal and nuclear power","bodyText":"Britain needs to undergo a \"renaissance in nuclear power\", and coal will continue to be a \"critically important fuel\" for the country, the business secretary, John Hutton, said today. In an outspoken speech, designed to put pressure on the Tories as they outline restrictions on coal-fired power stations, Hutton said that the two controversial sources of energy are crucial to ensure Britain retains a secure supply of energy. Hutton said the international battle for energy security poses a threat to Britain's competitiveness and its \"sovereignty as a nation\". In his speech to the Labour conference in Manchester, he added: \"It means a renaissance in nuclear power. Low carbon, reliable, secure... And because energy security is a first thought, not an afterthought, I will not turn my back on another critical source of energy security for the UK: coal.\" The business secretary said he understood that people felt passionate about coal. But he took a swipe at David Cameron, who has said he will ensure that a new generation of \"unabated coal power plants\" cannot be built by imposing a California-style emissions performance standard. Hutton said: \"I understand that people feel passionate about this issue. Others, like the Tories, see an opportunity for pandering. But coal is critically important for the UK. Flexible. Available. Reducing our reliance on imported gas.\" Hutton's remarks show that Labour believes that Cameron could be vulnerable on energy as high oil prices and the wider global economic downturn make people wary of restrictions on fuel even if they are designed to help the environment. Tony Blair believes he scored one of his greatest hits on Cameron on energy after the Tory leader described nuclear power as an \"option of last resort\". Blair said that government was about taking tough decisions and was not a multiple choice exam. Cameron has since indicated that he would be prepared to allow a new generation of nuclear power stations, though he warns that he would not provide any \"blank cheques\". Hutton said the Britain had to look beyond weathering the current economic storm to make changes — \"emerging stronger and fitter to seize the new manufacturing opportunities in the green economy and global markets of tomorrow\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/feb/06/sweden-nuclearpower","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-07T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Gwladys Fouché on Sweden's return to nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/06/sweden-nuclearpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/06/sweden-nuclearpower","fields":{"headline":"Getting a reaction","bodyText":"Much to the shock of many Swedes, the country has just overturned a ban on new atomic plants. As Terry Macalister reports, the government has decided to give the green light to a new generation of nuclear reactors to replace its ten existing plants. Sweden was at the forefront of anti-nuclear sentiment in the 1970s and 1980s, when the subject was one of the top political issues of the day. It split political parties. It tore families apart around the dinner table. It educated an entire generation of green-minded Swedes, who discovered the environment needed protection. Especially important was the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, which convinced many Swedes that nuclear power was not safe. Then, of course, there was Chernobyl in 1986. The nuclear question was so heated that in 1980, the then prime minister, Olof Palme, decided to submit it to a referendum. The verdict: phase out the country's plants by 2010. Which Sweden partly did: in 1998 and 2001, it closed down two reactors at its Bärseback plant. But it proved difficult to phase out the remaining ten plants. In 1997, government officials acknowledged there weren't enough alternative sources of energy to do it by 2010. So they decided to delay the target for about three decades by not replacing the existing reactors. Even today, about half of the country's electricity comes from nuclear power, with the rest produced from its hydroelectric dams. Yesterday's announcement could be the death knell of the 1980 referendum. Or maybe not – since the issue is now firmly on the political agenda for the 2010 general election. The opposition Green and Left parties are firmly against atomic energy, while the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, is deeply divided on the issue. And even though the leadership of the four ruling centre-right parties are now united in their support of nuclear power, there are rumblings within the ranks of two of the four groups, the Centre party and the Christian Democrats, which oppose the announcement. This has led some analysts to privately suggest that yesterday's move was primarily a political ploy to undermine the opposition, rather than a move to secure Sweden's energy supply. Since Fredrik Reinfeldt's government is trailing the opposition parties in the polls, what better way to undermine them than to throw an issue in the ring that can deeply divide them? It's the Swedish equivalent of Gordon Brown announcing that Britain will join the euro to tear apart the Conservatives. Sweden is also closely following what's going on next door in Finland, where the first nuclear reactor in western Europe in 15 years is being built. Its backers would like Olkiluoto 3 to be the shining new example of the a generation of nuclear reactors, but so far it's a nightmare, suffering endless delays and doubling budget costs. And even though most Swedes today favour the use of nuclear power, just two years ago they were debating whether it was safe after a fault at the Forsmark plant, 100 miles north of Stockholm. According to one of the chief engineers who helped built the plant in the 1980s, it was \"one of the most serious incidents that could have happened, short of an accident like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island\". Half of Sweden's nuclear park had to be shut down following the incident and Swedes were left wondering whether they were too dependent on nuclear energy. Far from putting an end to the nuclear debate in Sweden, yesterday's announcement could be just the beginning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/29/japan-mulls-nationalising-fukushima-company","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T08:53:00Z","webTitle":"Japan mulls nationalising Fukushima nuclear plant company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-mulls-nationalising-fukushima-company","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/29/japan-mulls-nationalising-fukushima-company","fields":{"headline":"Japan mulls nationalising Fukushima nuclear plant company","bodyText":"Japan's government is reportedly ready to consider nationalising the operator of the crippled power plant at the centre of the worst nuclear accident in the country's history. News that the state could take a majority stake in the Tokyo Electric Power company (Tepco) came after nuclear safety officials confirmed traces of plutonium had been found in soil in five locations in the Fukushima Daiichi atomic complex. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, fought off criticism of his handling of the crisis, insisting to MPs that a state of \"maximum alert\" would be maintained until the power plant had been made safe. Doubts over the future of Tepco, the largest power company in Asia, has coincided with mounting criticism of its handling of the world's worst nuclear emergency since Chernobyl. Much of the criticism is being directed at Tepco's president, Masataka Shimizu, who has not been seen in public for several days. Tepco officials said Shimizu, 66, had been absent for a few days last week due to a \"minor illness\", but claimed he had resumed work directing emergency operations at the company's headquarters in Tokyo. Shimizu hasn't appeared before the media since 13 March; for six days from 16 March, as his employees battled to prevent stricken reactors from going into full meltdown, he reportedly did not attend crisis meetings or visit Tepco's HQ. On 15 March Shimizu was on the receiving end of an outburst from Kan, who said the firm had been too slow to inform him of an explosion at the plant. Reporters overheard Kan demanding of Shimizu and other Tepco executives: \"What the hell is going on?\" In addition, Shimizu's firm has been accused of delaying the use of seawater to cool overheating reactors at Fukushima because of the damage it might cause. The government has since said the plant will be decommissioned. On Sunday, the firm offered wildly inaccurate readings of radiation levels inside the No 2 reactor building, for which it later apologised. Last week it emerged that two workers exposed to high levels of radiation were standing in puddles of contaminated water wearing only ankle boots. Shimizu, an enthusiastic cost cutter, was praised for restoring Tepco to profitability after it sustained heavy losses in a 2007 earthquake. But recent reports said that under Shimizu, Tepco failed to make mandatory safety checks and sought to extend the operational life of old reactors. Tepco's shares have lost about 70% of their value – or $30bn (£19bn) – since the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, and the cost of insuring its debts against default are 10 times higher than they were before the crisis. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, denied newspaper reports that nationalisation was among the options under consideration. \"It is my understanding that the government is not considering it,\" he said. \"The government will be directing Tepco to do everything possible to resolve the situation and help the people who are affected.\" But the national strategy minister, Koichiro Gemba, said it could not be ruled out. \"There will naturally be various debates about Tokyo Electric's future,\" Kyodo news agency quoted him as saying. Several members of the government reportedly believe the state should temporarily take control of the company to enable it to compensate businesses and households affected by radiation leaks, and to repair its damaged nuclear reactors. Hajime Motojuku, a Tepco spokesman, said he was unaware of any plans for nationalisation. \"Our first and biggest priority at this moment is to prevent the nuclear power plant accident from worsening further,\" he said. Tsunami and quake damage has forced a significant drop in Tepco's capacity to generate electricity, resulting in rolling power cuts that could last into the summer. Tepco is reportedly in talks with several banks over emergency loans worth a potential ¥2tn (£15bn), a move that surprised some analysts given its large cash reserves. Financial statements show that at the end of last year, Tepco held cash and similar assets worth ¥432bn, and ¥7.5tn in outstanding debt. Kan, meanwhile, faced accusations that his visit to Fukushima Daiichi the day after the tsunami had held up initial attempts to vent damaged reactors to relieve pressure inside them. Kan denied that his visit on the morning of 12 March had worsened the situation. \"It was necessary for me to go there to understand what was going on,\" he said. \"It was helpful in making decisions later on, and it's not true that my visit caused a delay in the procedure.\" Yosuke Isozaki, an opposition Liberal Democrat MP, said Kan should have ordered people living within a 20-30km (12-19-mile) radius of the plant to evacuate. The 130,000 people living in the area have so far been told to remain indoors. \"Is there anything as irresponsible as this?\" Isozaki said. Nuclear safety officials said the plutonium traces announced on Monday were not hazardous to health, but the discovery lends weight to fears that dangerously radioactive water is leaking from damaged nuclear fuel rods. \"The situation is very grave,\" Edano said. \"We are doing our utmost to contain the damage.\" If inhaled, plutonium, a byproduct of uranium fission, can linger in internal organs and bones and cause cancer. It is also an ingredient in mixed oxide (MOX) fuel used in the plant's No 3 reactor, but officials have yet to determine whether that is the source of the leak."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/food-water-energy-resource-efficiency","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-12T16:53:00Z","webTitle":"Live blog from Oxford University: food, water and energy for all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/food-water-energy-resource-efficiency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/food-water-energy-resource-efficiency","fields":{"headline":"Live blog from Oxford University: food, water and energy for all","bodyText":"9.34am: Welcome to Resource conference at the Smith School, Oxford Welcome to my live blog from the Smith School in Oxford where there is a fantastic line-up of speakers over the next two days to talk about the energy, water and food nexus and the role of investors in supporting the transition to a green economy. Today we have discussions on the economics of resource scarcity, meeting future energy demands, disruptive innovations and how resource efficiency translates into shareholder value. Those speaking include Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestle, Jeremy Grantham, founder of GMO and Andy Wales, head of sustainable development at SAB Miller. Tomorrow will have a focus on the link between politics and economics and will include Bill Clinton, David Milliband and Tony Giddens from the London School of Economics. I hope you enjoy having a ring side seat at this invitation-only event and that by the end of it, we have all learnt something useful. Sir David King, former government chief scientist and director of the Smith School, wants this event to be about finding solutions rather than just another round of talking. Let's see if they succeed. Apologies in advance for any typos but I don't have a back-up in London for part of the day and my typing is not as good as I would like. 9.56am: Coming up: Amartya Sen on resource scarcity Looking forward to the session coming soon with Jonathan Dimbleby interviewing Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen on the economics of resource scarcity. Key questions include the tools and mechanisms to redress market failures and how will increasing resource constraints affect pricing, distribution and volatility. he is speaking in the next few minutes. 10.09am: Amartya Sen on resource scarcity What is necessary for us is to point out the causal connections for the problems we have, such as womens' empowerment, which would help to reduce population growth and increase economic livelihoods. What is the role of the investors who tend to think short-term and what is his message to them: There have been terrible mistakes made but we need to look at changing the financial incentives. If you look at solar, it does not impact on global warming or suffer the catastrophic impacts of nuclear so we need more tax incentives for renewables and taking them away from the fossil-fuel industry. The whole idea of asking people to be responsible but not give incentives leads to schizophrenia. Technological reseearch will take place only when investors think there is money to be made and this is another reason for tax incentives. 10.13am: Amartya Sen Sen says fracking has an enormous environmental impacts in the areas it takes place. He says nuclear offers the chance of huge disaster from human error, natural disasters and the threat of terrorism, but this is not taken into account when looking at the benefits of solar. The world is dotted with nuclear power stations, so even small probabilities of risk add up to a very large risk. 10.20am: Amartya Sen on food How are we going to feed a growing population and what is the role of the private sector? The economic reasoning is pretty clear which is the problem is that people are getting richer and this is driving much of the increase in demand for food, and this will increase. Sen says that governments need to intervene and regulate the markets and provide appropriate incentives. Sen says he sees the glass as both half empty and half full and we can make the glass much more full if we think intelligently. 11.00am: David Nabarro, UN Secretary General's special representative on food security and nutrition Nabarro says Rio +20 showed that governments cannot find answers to the world's problems on their own and that civil society and business must become more involved. He warns there are increasing risks of wars from inequities and these must be dealt with, otherwise the future will be very difficult. We need to look at our institutions and political processes to amend them. 11.06am: David Nabarro on food He says there are several areas of promising action. The coming together of business, financial institutions and governments to look at new ways of investing in agriculture. He says Grow Africa has created new multi-stakeholder working and has real potential for progress. There are 30-40 other multiple-stakeholder groups that are going to create new ways of development. Second area is there are major poltiical groups like the G8 and regional groups putting equity of access at the centre of the political discourse. There are also new governance structures being created for mutli-stakeholder dialogues. Is it enough? No it is not, but the future of the work on food and nutrition needs correct policies and social contracts for participation, combined with the application of science. The old-style idea that we can pull a group of political leaders together to solve problems is long gone. 11.10am: Paul Conway, vice chairman of Cargill on food Conway says too many governments lack the air in their tyres to complete the Doha round of trade talks and only a few countries are showing leadership. He says there will need to be more trade to solve food problems as large populations are often not where food production is. He also says there needs to more productivity and governments must provide the right environment for this. But government cannot fix the problems, and must instead provide the ground on which business and NGOs can collaborate. There is also the risk of protectionism as witnessed recently by governments stopping exports of food as soon as problems arise. 11.16am: President Paul Kagame of Rwanda Kagame says on the issue of food: \"We understand the problems and what needs to be done. There ae resources out there that can be brought to bear. \"The main problem lies in people working together and doing what needs to be done. When people know what needs to be done, they often don't do it. \"If we continue to collaborate, I don't see why we cannot make good progress.\" 11.43am: The role of the meat industry Professor Charles Godfray, director of the Oxford Marlin programme on the future of food at the University of Oxford, says the statistics on meat consumption are pretty frightening and there are no obvious answers. One route is education so that people know the health and environmental advantages, but this will never reduce demand as required. The other route is political but at the moment there is no possibility of politicians taking action as electorates willl not accept meat reduction. He therefore says we need to have a sophisticated debate to legitimise governments to take action. Godfray also warns that few people recognise the scale of political and social problems we face if nothing is done to produce more food and distribute it equitably. Not only will we will see a massive increase of demand but also many shocks to the supply. He says business has a vital role to play in helping create a food system that provides food security and unleashes the innovation of the proivate sector while similtaneously protecting the poortest. Not only is this the right thing to do and if we do not, it willl lead to enormous political and social dislocation at a scale that few can now envisage. Paul Conway, the vice chairman of Cargill, said that meat consumption in the western world is not growing but you cannot tell people in the developing world they cannot eat meat. He said methane was a serious problem and they are looking to formulate livestock food that creates a more efficient conversion, leading to lower emissions. 11.56am: New collaboratons What's already coming out of the conference is the recognition that old-style multilateral negotiations are a thing of the past in terms of solving the world's sustainability challenges. This very much reflects the feelings at Rio+20 that the future lies in new forms of partnerships and collaborations between business, civil society and individual governments and regional alliances. But David Nabarro, the UN general secetary's special representative on food security and nutrition, warned that this patchwork of the coaltions of the willing can cause confusion if there is not a consensus on the direction of travel and the desired goals. On the issue of food, Nabarro does believe this happened in Rio, with five key objectives. The eliminatiion of hunger, the creation of sustainable agriculture, more produtive smalholder, big reductions in food waste and wasteful consumpiton, and also improvements in nutrition. He says: Ban Ki-moon's zero hunger challenge; that is the post Rio compass on all our work on food and there is a reasonable chance that if enough stakeholders align behind this, we can all move in the same direction.\" 12.20pm: Meeting future energy demand Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research, University of Oxford, paints a bleak picture on energy, which he says is absolutely key as without that we cannot tackle all the other problems in the world. He says governments do not follow up on pledges on energy reductions and meanwhile, demand is going to continue shooting up, particularly in the developing world. Changing human behaviour is difficult and if people save energy in one place, they think they can use more elsewhere. Smith also says you can redesign cities but this is very slow because much infrastructure is already in place. On top of this, the only serious renewable at the moment is hydro so there needs to be a vast increase in other renewables but these are expensive. What he shows is just how difficult it is to change. 12.38pm: BG chairman attacks oil and gas indusry over fracking Andrew Gould, chairman of BG Group, has warned the oil and gas industry that they need to radically change the way they approach fracking if the industry to have any long-term future. He admitted that companies in the past have used a \"blitzed technique\" which is essentially that \"you frack as much as you can and hope you open up a route.\" He said the reason for this is that the oil and gas industry has been using classic petroleum measurements that do not apply to shale. He says the industry has to \"eventually identify the way that works so that the size and number of frackings will decrease and if it does not happen, the industry will never take off.\" Gould said that much more work also needs to be done to ensure that drilling fluids and oil and gas do not migrate and pollute natural water aquifers. On top of all this, Gould said much more must be done to ensure the systematic capture of methane and that companies need to engage with local communities. If all these changes were carried out, Gould said it would not do much to increase the cost of fracking. He said that if you look at satellite shots of the pockmarked landscape of previous fracking in the United States, it is \"horrifying.\" He said the industry tends to get in front of itself and now has to prove it can be environmentally conscious. 12.51pm: Carbon taxes Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research, University of Oxford, says the absence of a carbon taxation should be seen as destroying the planet. He calls for subsidies for renewables and that subsidies for fossil fuels should be cut. However, he warns that vested interests always try to keep subsidies in place and that there should always be a route to phase them out. What investors need is certainty about how the future looks, so they can price this into their plans. 1.35pm: Nestle chairman warns that water presents us with a global crisis Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestle, says there is little recognition in society of just how important water is for our social and economic livelihood and how vulnerable we are from overuse. Interestingly he also pointed out that new technologies across sectors is leading to increasing water usage. Brabeck-Letmathe said that not only has water been primarily responsible for people living longer but also for extraordinary GDP growth. In the past, with a population of 2.5bn, we did not even have to think about water but now we are using it unsustainably. He says: \"In 2005 we were for the first time using water unsustainably and for the first time today we are using non sustainable water. We are now taking it away from the environment,\" which is leading to natural disasters. Brabeck-Letmathe said that in the future we will not have the water to produce the energy we need, nor to produce the food for an increasing population. He says research of 154 water basins does show there are solutions to balance sustainable water use with economic growth and 240 different levers of change have been identified. \"There are sufficient possibilities to bring water usage to balance,\" he says, \"but it needs political decisions and a better understanding of the water supply. \"It is clear that if we are not tackling this issue, which is not the next 100 years. This problem is of today. We are already using too much water.\" 2.16pm: Nestle chairman in devastating critique of biofuels The chairman of Nestle has launched a devastating critique of biofuels and called for a ban on plantations that replace food production. \"We are taking away water from where we need it most, to assure food supply,\" says Peter Brabeck-Letmathe \"I am not against biofuels but against replacing food for fuel, and if we came to this simple decision to stop doing this, we would be stabilising raw materials prices for food.\" Brabeck-Letmathe said the single most important political decision made in the last five years, was to go ahead with subsidising biofuels and this had come about because of a silo mentaility. He said the biofuels had been given a beautiful sounding name that gave it the aura of being \"about life\" but behind this facade was a direct attempt by politicians to pass on subsidies to farmers. He says: \"People did not understand and some still don't that the food market and the energy market is the same market.\" and that the result of replacing 20% of land used for food would lead to spiralling costs. He also says that if water had been given a fair value, then a decision would never have been taken to go ahead with biofuels, as each litre needed 9100 litres of water. The Nestle chairman's criticism was echoed by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, minister of environment and water resources in Singapore, who said that biofuel production had been encouraged through \"stupid subsidies\" and he had witnessed peat lands and forests being destroyed to create biofuels, creating more carbon emissions then would have been saved through switching from fossil fuels. 3.27pm: If you read Jeremy Grantham's predictions of the future, pour yourself a stiff drink first If you are depressed about the sustainability challenges of our age, you will be reaching for the bottle if you listen to Jeremy Grantham, the head of successful fund manager GMO. Although Grantham says he is a cheerful pessimist, seeing the glass as three-quarters empty, but there was precious little liquid to see after hearing his view of the world. He says that it is possible to adapt to our current circumstances, but the likelihood of that happening is limited due to a lack of courageous politicians, vested interests, inertia and dedication to short-termism. While it may be possible to stop the global population at 10 billion, the carrying capacity of the planet is likely to be less than five billion. Added to this is the extraordinary demands for raw materials from China, which now uses 59% of the world's cement, 48% of all coal, 45% of all steel and 47% of all pigs. Beyond that, even if we get far better at recycling, \"metal is slipping through our fingers,\" and water scarcity will lead to wars. Water problems are self-inflicted because the problem is caused by waste and a lack of valuing it in terms of pricing. Soil erosion is accelerating and we are at a peak of using fertilisers because prices have jumped five-fold and availability will be limited in the future. Beyond that, the increase in beef consumption is eating into the ability to produce crops such as rice and wheat. Grantham says that climate instability will lead to more unprecedented weather changes and this will cause a ruinous drop in food production. Beyond all this, scientists have been underestimating the threat from climate change and that the problem is far worse than most people so far recognise. \"Almost all climate scientists recognise the problem is worse that they are saying,\" he says. Beyond this, food currently accounts for at least 40% of poor household incomes and with food prices likely to double over the next 20 years, \"who will pay for this?\" Perhaps Grantham's greatest vitriol is aimed at incentives for the use of US maize for producing ethanol. As he points out, the maize needed to produce the fuel to fill one tank of one SUV, would feed an Indian person for a year. Grantham finishes up by quoting Churchill: \"The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\" How are you feeling now? 3.55pm: A little known fact: An aircraft carrier does an average of 12 inches per gallon of fuel If you worry about the miles per gallon of your car, spare a thought for rear admiral Neil Morisetti, the climate and energy security envoy of the UK Ministry of Defence. When he was in charge of an aircraft carrier, he calculated that he used to get 12 inches for every gallon of fuel he used. Morisetti uses this example to point out that the Ministry of Defence is increasingly needing to think, like other businesses, how to reduce its reliance on fossil-fuels. Without fuel, the army cannot fight but securing supplies is increasingly difficult, and Morisetti gives the example of the problems with getting fuel to troops in Afghanistan. More than this, it has to be protected, it ties people down, and the cost of fuel in war zones is 10 times the normal price. \"We have to have an energy plan which recognises we need to reduce costs and risks by changing our behaviour,\" he says. \"For example big bits of kit needs generators while smaller bits of kids can use batteries.\" 4.32pm: How even Unilever is struggling to get any investor interest in its sustainability performance If you are under any illusion that investors are interested in sustainability, then go and speak to Unilever's finance director, Jean-Marc Huet. Even though Unilever is a leader in building social, ethical and environmental measures into the heart of its business, investors couldn't be less interested. Huet says that when he goes around presenting the multinational's financial performance, \"next to no-one\" asks about sustainability in general and resource efficiency in particular. Huet has therefore gone in search of investors who are interested in discussing these aspects, albeit with little success, and has spoken with other companies who share the same experience. Given this depressing situation, Huet says it is likely that integrated reporting, which gives equal weight between financial and non-financial measures, is the best way forward. While Huet says \"this has to be the way to go,\" he warns that trying to tie down effective measures for non-financial areas is no easy task. \"A lot of people are talking about integrated reporting but I am still concentrating on demonstrating that our numbers are correct,\" he says. Huet says we need to get to a position where companies are not just giving profit warnings, but also resource efficiency warnings. When asked if Unilever's own pension fund is taking these issues seriously, Huet admits it could do more but adds that this issue is currently being discussed. The reason why Huet's comments are more than of just passing interest is that there are fears at senior levels of the sustainability movement, that Unilever could be at risk if it suffers from a dip in its financial performance. Peter Bakker, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, told me in Rio the other week that if investors took the sustainability work of Unilever CEO Paul Polman seriously, then he would be considered a hero. As it is, if the company's profits take a hit, people will blame it on Polman's sustainable living plan and see its work in this field as a liability. 5.09pm: Moving from vision to action I have been speaking to a few key delegates at the conference and the general impression is we need to move from high level visioning to practical action. I think there is a general feeling in the sustainability world that we need to take more time to show solutions working on the ground, and to learn best practice, so that we can take more experiments to scale. The key point is that words are not going to save humanity and stop the planet being degraded. The time for talking is over, the time for action is upon us. 5.11pm: Today is over but tomorrow is another day..... My hands are starting to hurt so I am going to wrap up for the day. But please join us tomorow for the second day of the Resource conference at Oxford University's Smith School. Coming up tomorrow are Bill Clinton, Jochen Zeitz, Sir Terry Leahy, David Milliband, Will Hutton and Lord Mandelson. I hope that today has been useful and if nothing else, we have learnt that an aircraft carrier does 12 inches to a gallon of fuel :)"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/15/energy-new-sources-robin-mckie","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-14T23:06:00Z","webTitle":"A golden opportunity for Britain to lead the world in energy production | Robin McKie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/15/energy-new-sources-robin-mckie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/15/energy-new-sources-robin-mckie","fields":{"headline":"A golden opportunity for Britain to lead the world in energy production","bodyText":"This week, our leaders are expected to commit Britain to a civic overhaul that no other nation has had the courage – or recklessness, depending on your viewpoint – to contemplate. On Tuesday, the cabinet is set to approve measures that will lead to a revolution in power generation, transport, house construction, planning, manufacturing and farming in Britain over the next 20 years. The aim is to mitigate the worst ravages of global warming. The proposals form the basis of the fourth budget of the Committee on Climate Change and will be presented for cabinet consideration this week so they can be made law by the end of June. Initial hostility from business secretary Vince Cable and from Treasury officials, who fear funds needed for economic recovery are being wasted on projects of no immediate benefit, has been swept aside. Soon, we will be committed to the basic, radical goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions to around 390m tonnes a year by 2027. To put those figures in perspective, current emissions stand at 550m tonnes while subsequent measures could produce even greater reductions – to around 200m – by the middle of the century. Thus the cabinet will trigger moves that will bring about the virtual decarbonisation of our society. The fossil fuels – coal, gas and oil – which powered Britain to industrial and imperial might will be outlawed. In their place, wind farms, nuclear power stations, electric cars and underground dumps of carbon dioxide will provide the bedrock for future economic growth in this country. Britain's basic infrastructure is facing a radical rebuilding. Other nations have made emission commitments, but most have planned no further than the end of this decade. The Committee on Climate Change's budget takes Britain 10 years further down the line. As its chief executive, David Kennedy, says: \"We have moved into uncharted territory and we are going to be watched, carefully, by other countries. No one else has a target like this.\" The budget is therefore not just one of domestic importance, it is of international significance. Hence the support of foreign secretary William Hague, who has made plain his backing for the budget. \"If our domestic resolve is seen to be weakening, we will lose traction elsewhere,\" he said last month. But what kind of nation will Britain be once we start investing those billions, raised from taxes and increased electricity costs, in new hardware? How will we move around the country and how will we power our homes and businesses? Very differently, it is clear. According to the committee, by 2027, we should be generating 40% of our electricity from renewable sources (currently only a few per cent) and 40% from nuclear plants (roughly double its present level). The remainder will come from coal, gas and oil plants, with the crucial caveat that most will be connected to carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems that will trap their carbon dioxide emissions and pump them underground for safe storage. With that kind of kit, Britain can free itself from its dependence on fossil fuels and seriously cut back on harmful heating carbon emissions, says the committee. The obvious point is that most of this hardware does not exist yet. Carbon capture and storage is still only a gleam in the eyes of the odd, enthusiastic geologist, for example. Only one or two pilot plants are in operation at present. This is unproven technology. Similarly, it is clear that the goal of generating 40% of our electricity from renewables cannot be met through our current obsession with building onshore wind farms. There is not enough land on the British Isles to provide homes for them. We will need other sources of renewable power. Tidal power plants and wave energy generators are two particularly promising candidates, though again the technologies involved are unproved. And that might seem remiss. Relying on power sources that have still to be developed looks naive, an apparent oversight that will certainly be pounced on by those who deny that fossil fuels are dangerous and that we need to wean ourselves off their use. We are taxing ourselves to sustain an unrealistic ecological dream, they argue. The argument is disingenuous, however. The very fact that many of these technologies are still in development offers us a key advantage. Over the past four decades, Britain has amassed a great deal of marine engineering experience following the exploitation of North Sea oil, for example. That expertise is precisely the kind needed to build up a strong offshore wind turbine industry in the UK. The same is true for both tidal and wave power plants. The seas around Britain have some of the strongest tides in the world and are ripe for exploitation. Generating devices are still at a relatively primitive development stage, though plans have been announced for trials of tidal devices in Islay and Orkney. These are reckoned to have considerable promise. They will need careful and costly nurture, however. The same goes for carbon capture and storage. We not only have North Sea oil experience, we have the depleted gas and oil fields that will make ideal stores for the carbon dioxide we extract from fossil plants. In total, it's quite a package. The crucial point is that by acting in a timely manner in facing up to climate change, Britain has given itself a chance to take pole position in the development of a range of renewable technologies which could then be sold round the world. For that, the government deserves congratulations. Passing the carbon budget is just the start, however, for it is equally clear that if we want to exploit these opportunities we will need to adopt a far more realistic attitude to the generation of power than we have in the past. In the 20th century, Britain was given crucial leads that we should have used to build up other types of energy generation. We squandered them instead. Calder Hall, in Cumbria, was the first atom plant to supply power to a national grid, for example. However, development of the next generation of UK nuclear stations – the advanced gas-cooled reactor – was botched. As a result, Britain's tranche of atom plants will be either French or American. Similarly, we should have taken a lead in wind turbine development, given the gusty meteorological conditions of these islands but again we fluffed the chance. As a result, the wind farms that dot the countryside consist of turbines that are made in Denmark or Germany. The new carbon budget gives Britain a chance to cut its emissions bill, establish energy security for the nation for the next century – and develop a range of new industries. The last on this list is arguably the most important – and the most vulnerable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/11/sahara-solar-panels-green-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-11T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Could the desert sun power the world?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/sahara-solar-panels-green-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/11/sahara-solar-panels-green-electricity","fields":{"headline":"Could the desert sun power the world?","bodyText":"During the summer of 1913, in a field just south of Cairo on the eastern bank of the Nile, an American engineer called Frank Shuman stood before a gathering of Egypt's colonial elite, including the British consul-general Lord Kitchener, and switched on his new invention. Gallons of water soon spilled from a pump, saturating the soil by his feet. Behind him stood row upon row of curved mirrors held aloft on metal cradles, each directed towards the fierce sun overhead. As the sun's rays hit the mirrors, they were reflected towards a thin glass pipe containing water. The now super-heated water turned to steam, resulting in enough pressure to drive the pumps used to irrigate the surrounding fields where Egypt's lucrative cotton crop was grown. It was an invention, claimed Shuman, which could help Egypt become far less reliant on the coal being imported at great expense from Britain's mines. \"The human race must finally utilise direct sun power or revert to barbarism,\" wrote Shuman in a letter to Scientific American magazine the following year. But the outbreak of the first world war just a few months later abruptly ended his dream and his solar troughs were soon broken up for scrap, with the metal being used for the war effort. Barbarism, it seemed, had prevailed. Almost a century later, a convoy of air-conditioned coaches sweeps through the affluent suburb of Maadi – where Shuman had demonstrated his fledgling solar panels – continuing south for 90km towards Kuraymat, an area of flat, uninhabited desert near the city of Beni Suef. The high-level international delegation of CEOs, politicians, financiers and scientists has come to visit a brand new \"hybrid\" power station that uses both natural gas and solar panels to generate electricity. Before the coaches reach the facility's security gates, its 6,000 parabolic troughs – each six metres tall with a combined surface area of 130,000sq metres – are already visible from the perimeter road. Even though the panels account for just one seventh of the power plant's 150MW generating capacity, the Egyptian government, which has been pushing to develop the site since 1997, hopes to prove to the delegation that it is the desert sun – not fossil fuels, such as gas, coal and oil – that should be used not only to generate far more of the electricity across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), but, crucially, for neighbouring Europe, too. Gerhard Knies, a German particle physicist, was the first person to estimate how much solar energy was required to meet humanity's demand for electricity. In 1986, in direct response to the Chernobyl nuclear accident, he scribbled down some figures and arrived at the following remarkable conclusion: in just six hours, the world's deserts receive more energy from the sun than humans consume in a year. If even a tiny fraction of this energy could be harnessed – an area of Saharan desert the size of Wales could, in theory, power the whole of Europe – Knies believed we could move beyond dirty and dangerous fuels for ever. Echoing Schuman's own frustrations, Knies later asked whether \"we are really, as a species, so stupid\" not to make better use of this resource. Over the next two decades, he worked – often alone – to drive this idea into public consciousness. The culmination of his efforts is \"Desertec\", a largely German-led initiative that aims to provide 15% of Europe's electricity by 2050 through a vast network of solar and wind farms stretching right across the Mena region and connecting to continental Europe via special high voltage, direct current transmission cables, which lose only around 3% of the electricity they carry per 1,000km. The tentative total cost of building the project has been estimated at €400bn (£342bn). Until now, Desertec has been seen by many observers as little more than a mirage in the sand; the fanciful plan of well-meaning dreamers. After all, the technical, political, security and financial hurdles can, each on their own, appear to be utterly insurmountable. But over the past two years, the initiative has received significant support from some of the biggest corporate names in Germany, a country that already leads Europe when it comes to adopting and developing renewable energy, particularly solar. In the autumn of 2009, an \"international\" consortium of companies formed the Desertec Industrial Initiative (Dii) with weighty companies, such as E.ON, Munich Re, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, all signing up as \"shareholders\". Germany's announcement earlier this year that, in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it was to speed up its total phase-out of nuclear power suddenly pulled the Desertec idea into much sharper focus. Coupled with faltering international negotiations and increasingly dire warnings on climate change – just last month the International Energy Agency warned that the world is headed for irreversible climate change if it doesn't start reducing carbon emissions within five years – it would seem the time is now right for an idea of such scale and ambition. Last month, at its annual conference in Cairo, Dii confirmed to the world that the first phase of the Desertec plan is set to begin in Morocco next year with the construction of a 500MW solar farm near to the desert city of Ouarzazate. The 12sq km project would act as a \"reference project\" that, much like Egypt's own project at Kuraymat, would help convince both investors and politicians that similar farms could be repeated across the Mena region in the coming years and decades. \"It's all systems go in Morocco,\" announced Paul van Son, Dii's CEO, to the visiting delegates. Talks, he added, were – given their shared close proximity, along with Morocco, to western Europe's grid – already under way with Tunisia and Algeria about joining the \"first phase\" of Desertec. Countries such as Egypt, Syria, Libya and Saudi Arabia would be expected to join in the \"scale-up\" phase from 2020 onwards, once extra transmission cables were laid across the Mediterranean and via Turkey, with the whole venture becoming financially self-sustaining by 2035. Van Son swats away any talk that the Desertec project is built on a precarious foundation of presumption, naivety and hope. \"Yes, the current global financial crisis has clearly not been very helpful, but everyone also realises that being dependent on fossil fuels creates vulnerability,\" he says. He also rejects any notion that Desertec carries with it even a whiff of neo-colonialism. Earlier this year such sentiments were raised by Daniel Ayuk Mbi Egbe of the African Network for Solar Energy. \"Many Africans are sceptical [about Desertec],\" he said. \"[Europeans] make promises, but at the end of the day, they bring their engineers, they bring their equipment, and they go. It's a new form of resource exploitation, just like in the past.\" Other Mena-based speakers made similar points, not least that any electricity generated will first be desperately needed by local populations as they fight poverty. \"When the idea for Desertec was first announced there was anger and irritation from the Arab League,\" admits Van Son. \"They didn't understand it at first, but we explained that it would benefit their members, too. We explained it would be a cooperative process and they became more relaxed. It's a win-win for all, we stressed. The relationship is all positive now.\" Desertec should also be supported, argue its champions, because it will improve energy security by helping to diversify supply. At present, says Van Son, Europeans are vulnerable to the so-called \"energy weapon\", namely, when an energy-rich country holds its neighbours to ransom by restricting or denying supply. Think Russia and its gas, he says. Or a terrorist attack on an oil pipeline. Desertec will help to dilute these threats. He is bemused, though, that the current domination of Dii by German companies should rouse suspicion. (There was not a single political or corporate representative from the UK at the conference, yet at least half hailed from Germany.) \"Yes, the initiative came from Germany. But there are 15 different nationalities involved, including companies such as HSBC and Morgan Stanley. This is just the start.\" A common question at the conference is: \"Who is going to pay for Desertec?\" There is talk of loans from development institutions such as the World Bank (the route being taken by Morocco). The presence of German banks suggests they are considering being key lenders, too. But there is also the implication that much of the burden will fall on the European taxpayer, either through EU subsidies, or tariffs added to their energy bills. Angelika Niebler, a Christian Democrat MEP from Germany, travelled to Cairo as a member of the European parliament's energy committee. She says it is \"too early\" to talk about EU financing but adds: \"Energy is going to be a bigger priority for the EU in coming years than agriculture has been in the past and Desertec will surely feature.\" Hans Josef-Fell, a representative of Germany's Green party, is also in Cairo for the conference. \"There is a fear in Germany that paying for green electricity direct from North Africa will be too heavy a burden on our consumers,\" he says. Germany already has among the highest electricity prices in Europe, in part because of a huge wave of renewable energy installations across the country. Europe, particularly Germany, seems to increasingly know what it wants from Desertec. But what of its Mena partners? Obaïd Amrane, a board member of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy, the government body responsible for overseeing Desertec's first plant, says his country has its own plans for the electricity generated at the facility – and for the other four that will follow by 2020 – and it doesn't necessarily include selling it to Europe. \"By 2020, we are expecting a doubling of electricity consumption in Morocco, as the population and standard of living grow,\" he says. \"At the moment, we are 97% dependent on foreign energy which is becoming increasingly unsustainable. But we are now aiming to have 42% capacity of renewable electricity by 2020. We will build extra capacity beyond what Morocco needs if someone wants us to, but we will need a big share of the electricity produced by these projects.\" Such sentiments propose another challenge for Desertec: how will it guarantee that the electricity Europe needs is sent down the transmission cables and not just all consumed locally? And how will Mena countries justify selling the electricity to Europe – where the retail price of electricity can be up to 20 times more expensive – if the local population is, say, experiencing regular blackouts? At the visitor centre at Kuraymat, bottles of chilled water are being distributed ahead of a tour of the parabolic troughs. The mid-morning November sun is already heating the engine oil-like fluid inside the troughs' receiver tubes – a technology not that far removed from Shuman's century-old design – up towards 400C. The technical questions are coming thick and fast for Bodo Becker, the operations manager at Flagsol, the German company that specialises in building concentrated solar power (CSP) plants in the deserts of the US, Spain and now Egypt. The leading query is how the troughs perform in such harsh conditions. \"We only have one sandstorm, on average, pass through here each year,\" he says, \"but we tilt the troughs down and away from the wind whenever it gets up beyond 12 metres per second, as they act like giant sails.\" Keeping them clean is the main challenge, he adds. \"Due to the dusty conditions, we are witnessing about 2% degradation every day in performance, so we need to clean them daily. We use about 39 cubic metres of demineralised water each day for cleaning across the whole site.\" This surprises many delegates, as they have previously been told at the conference that CSP troughs need cleaning weekly compared to photovoltaic panels which need cleaning monthly. Either way, it highlights yet another challenge for Desertec: can enough local water ever be secured for cleaning duties? The Nile is just a few miles from Kuraymat, but some countries aim to push much deeper into their deserts to build such facilities. \"Dry cleaning\" technologies are being developed, but they reduce the generating efficiency at the plant. Either way, the super-heated transfer fluid requires cooling before it can loop back to the troughs for re-use, and, as with cleaning, water is the cheapest and easiest way to do this. Until \"dry cooling\" technologies are further advanced, it could limit solar farms to the desert fringes close to large bodies of water. Somewhat counter-intuitively, some countries, such as Jordan, now favour wind over solar as a source of desert energy, because it is currently more affordable and isn't so water-intensive. But it is suspected that it will be many years before a single desert energy technology comes to dominate the market. Some within the industry advocate photovoltaic panels, but, currently, CSP is more popular. However, even within CSP, there are loyalists for parabolic troughs and others for \"solar towers\", which rely on hundreds of pivoting mirrors laid out on the ground to track the sun and direct its rays towards one fixed point at the top of a giant tower. Whichever technology succeeds, it is already clear which nation in particular will win out as Desertec develops in the coming decades. One member of the visiting delegation asks Becker where the troughs are made. \"The metal cradles were made here in Egypt, but the glass troughs were all made in Germany,\" he says. \"And only two companies in the world make the glass tube receivers, which is where the main intellectual property of this technology lays – Schott Solar and Siemens.\" Both companies are German."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/23/tokyo-water-unsafe-infants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T10:18:48Z","webTitle":"Tokyo water unsafe for infants after high radiation levels detected","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/23/tokyo-water-unsafe-infants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/23/tokyo-water-unsafe-infants","fields":{"headline":"Tokyo water unsafe for infants after high radiation levels detected","bodyText":"Authorities in Tokyo have warned that very young children in the Japanese capital should not drink tap water after it was found to contain twice the levels of radioactive iodine considered safe for infants. The warning came as the spread of radioactivity continued through the food supply in the region surrounding the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Black smoke was seen rising yesterday afternoon from the plant's No 3 reactor, prompting the operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) to evacuate workers who have been battling to make the facility safe. The source of the smoke was not immediately known. Tests conducted by the Tokyo metropolitan government identified 210 becquerels of iodine-131 per 1kg of tap water in the city, more than twice the limit of 100 becquerels considered safe for infants. Tokyo's water bureau said babies and infants under the age of one should not be given tap water, but added that radiation levels did not pose an immediate risk to adults. \"This is without doubt, an effect of the Fukushima Daiichi plant,\" a metropolitan government official said. The capital's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, said the levels were not hazardous to health, but advised parents of children aged under one not to use tap water with milk formula. Earlier this week, some residents living near the nuclear plant, 150 miles north of Tokyo, were told not to drink tap water owing to abnormal levels of radioactive iodine, which can cause thyroid cancer if ingested in large enough quantities. Until yesterday tests had shown negligible iodine-131 levels in Tokyo tap water. Jim Smith, reader in environmental physics at the Portsmouth University, said: \"Following the finding of up to 210 becquerels of radioactive iodine in tap water in Tokyo, the recommendation that infants are not given tap water is a sensible precaution. But it should be emphasised that the limit is set at a low level to ensure that consumption at that level is safe over a fairly long period of time. This means that consumption of small amounts of tap water – a few litres, say – at twice the recommended limit would not present a significant health risk. I would expect that the recommendation not to drink tap water would also extend to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, instructed authorities in Fukushima to issue a ban on the consumption of certain agricultural products grown in the prefecture after radioactivity exceeding legal limits was found in 11 types of vegetable. The list of contaminated produce includes spinach, komatsuna leaves, cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. The government has also suspended shipment of the vegetables. None of those products have reached the market since Monday, when the alarm was raised about contamination, according to Japan's agricultural co-operatives. The health ministry detected 82,000 becquerels of radioactive caesium – 164 times the limit permitted by law, in kukitachina leaves from Motomiya in Fukushima prefecture, as well as 15,000 becquerels of radioactive iodine – more than seven times the limit. Contamination has spread to neighbouring prefectures, with Ibaraki told to suspend shipments of milk and parsley. The US, meanwhile, has become the first country to ban milk and food imports from Fukushima and three neighbouring prefectures. The US food and drug administration said it would halt imports of dairy products, vegetables and fruit from the four prefectures, and would screen seafood and produce imported from other parts of Japan. South Korea is reportedly considering similar measures, while France has asked the European commission to examine a community-wide response to Japanese food imports found to have been contaminated. The Japanese government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said abnormal levels of radioactivity in food posed no threat to human health and urged trading partners to act rationally. \"We will explain to countries the facts and we hope they will take logical measures based on that,\" he told reporters. Tepco, meanwhile, has secured 2tn yen in loans to rebuild its power supply networks, which was badly damaged in the 11 March earthquake and tsunami. Sumitomo Mitsui bank is to provide 600bn yen (£4.5bn), Mizuho 500bn yen and Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ about 300bn. The banks are expected to make the cash available by the end of the month. Analysts said the loans suggested the government wants to secure Tepco's survival, despite its central role in the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. \"Given the amount of cash on [Tepco's] balance sheet, I'm surprised at the urgency of the loan talks, but certainly the need to prevent a crisis of confidence could be seen as necessary to keep recovery efforts stable,\" said Penn Bowers of CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in Tokyo. \"It's interesting, as one suspects that the government has implicitly guaranteed the survival of Tepco as a regulated entity if all these institutions are willing to accept the risk.\" The Japanese government estimates that the earthquake and tsunami caused damage totalling 16tn yen ($185bn) to 25tn yen, making it the world's costliest natural disaster. The sum dwarfs the $100bn (£600m) of damage cause by the Kobe earthquake in January 1995, and does not include the effect on economic activity from rolling blackouts, which could continue for several weeks, or the impact of the Fukushima nuclear emergency. \"The impact from the planned power outages is likely to be significant,\" said Fumihira Nishizaki, a cabinet office official said. The Bank of Japan's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said the disaster would have severe consequences for the economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2011/mar/05/letters-international-student-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-05T19:56:28Z","webTitle":"Cuts in the number of international students spell disaster | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/mar/05/letters-international-student-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2011/mar/05/letters-international-student-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Cuts in the number of international students spell disaster","bodyText":"We write to express profound concern at the damage that would be caused to the UK economy and to our universities if the government's proposals to reduce the number of international students coming to the UK are implemented.

But evidence shows that international students in universities overwhelmingly do not abuse the system. International students coming to universities contribute more than £5bn each year to the UK economy through tuition fees and off-campus expenditure. Reductions in student numbers will lead to reductions in income and jobs. Without international students, many university courses, particularly science and engineering ones, may no longer be viable. This will in turn reduce the courses available to UK students. International students bring extensive cultural and political benefits to the UK. When they return to their countries at the end of their studies, they become cultural and economic ambassadors for the UK.

Display bans have been successfully introduced in Ireland, Canada and most of Australia. Rises in minimum wages and tobacco smuggling explain the decline in the number of independent retailers in Canada, not the ban.

The man she would come to know as Bob Robinson was standing on his own. Jenny (not her real name), a 24-year-old who had come to the capital to find work, was intrigued by the slim man with the endearing smile, who was slightly older than her. They fell easily into conversation and before long, Jenny was smitten. The love she felt for him rolls easily off her tongue. He was, she says, \"polite, considerate, very romantic, attentive, charismatic\". He smiled a lot and was non-judgmental. And he was cute. \"I thought I had found my Mr Right. He was very charming and I thought I could take him to meet my parents,\" she says. They had an 18-month relationship and one of his characteristics struck her in particular: \"I thought he had a high moral code.\" But now she feels very different about him. It turns out that there was a lot more to Bob Robinson than his impassioned campaigning and shoulder-length hair, which gave every impression of a rebel with many causes. He was, in fact, the opposite. Bob Lambert today admits he was an undercover police officer who had created the fictional persona of Bob Robinson to spy on political activists. The special branch officer was one of a group of police spies in a covert unit who have been infiltrating and disrupting the activities of political campaign groups across Britain for decades. Jenny and others only discovered his true identity more than 20 years after they first met him. The discovery has left Jenny feeling that he deceived her about the bedrock of any relationship – his identity. She is very hurt that he duped her about who he was. \"I was cruelly tricked and it has made me very angry. I feel violated,\" she said. As she was trying to persuade him to set up home and have a family together, he was resisting, claiming he had to flee abroad as he was being pursued by special branch because he was a dangerous radical activist. The sorry episode has left her wondering if he loved her at all. Today, Lambert admits that \"as part of my alter ego's cover story, I had a relationship with 'Jenny', to whom I owe an unreserved apology\". So far, seven undercover police officers who infiltrated political groups have been exposed – and most have admitted or have been accused of sleeping with activists they were spying on. They have faced claims that they did so to glean intelligence about the activists and the protests they were organising. A growing number of women say they have suffered terrible trauma and damage from the betrayal of having a relationship with a person they later found out was a fake. Police chiefs claim that undercover officers are forbidden from having sex with their targets \"under any circumstances\" as it is \"unacceptable and unprofessional\". But Pete Black, an undercover officer from the same unit who infiltrated anti-racist groups in the 1990s, said sex was widely used as a technique to blend in and gather intelligence. He said there was an informal code in the unit that the spies should not fall in love with the women – or allow the women to fall in love with them. An investigation by the Guardian has shown that Lambert was no ordinary police spy. His skills of deception would earn him legendary status in the elite ranks of the covert unit known as the special demonstration squad (SDS). \"He did what is hands down regarded as the best tour of duty ever,\" said Black. Lambert admits that in the 1980s, he \"first built a reputation as a committed member of London Greenpeace, a peaceful campaigning group [on environmental issues]\". He did so \"as part of my cover story\" to \"gain the necessary credibility to become involved in serious crime\". His aim was to penetrate the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), which he says was \"then engaged in incendiary device and explosive device campaigns against targets in the vivisection, meat and fur trades\". In the 1990s, he drew on the techniques he had learned undercover to become the head of operations in the covert unit, running a network of spies. It was May 1987 when Jenny met Bob. Very quickly they were spending most of their free time together. Bob said he was a gardener, doing cash-in-hand jobs in well-heeled places such as Hampstead. He told her that he was also earning a living by driving a minicab, although he was touting illegally for customers. But politics was really his thing, he said. He told her how he was deeply involved in campaigning for animal rights and the environment. Bob confided that he was heavily active in the ALF. But she was not interested. \"He was always asking me to go to meetings. He introduced me to lots of activists. I did not realise what the ALF was.\" But why did Lambert have a relationship with Jenny when she had never been an activist ? \"I have no idea. It's a great mystery,\" she says. It seems from his admission today that he was using her as his girlfriend so that he could portray himself as a fully rounded person with a private life to the rest of his political and social circle. Activists, eternally on their guard against police spies, are suspicious of people who, for example, turn up at their meetings out of the blue without any discernible evidence of friends or a family. Taking her along to the pub or parties with other activists was a neat way of deflecting those suspicions. Jenny was working at the time as an administrative assistant at the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board. But she kept quiet about her job as she feared the activists would take against her because the CEGB was running nuclear power stations. She was keen to develop her career and have a family. She lived in an east London house with eight other friends, but none of them were politically active, other than having a general antipathy to Margaret Thatcher's government. They spent most nights together at her house, although he lived in what she called a \"grotty flat above a barber's\" in Hackney. He had a \"single man's room with a shared kitchen\" but with very little in it. \"He claimed to be not interested in possessions,\" she said. A few months into their relationship came the episode that was to seal Lambert's reputation as one of the best undercover operatives the SDS had ever had. In the summer of 1987, Lambert had been undercover for three years and had worked his way into the inner recesses of the animal rights movement. The Animal Liberation Front operated through a tightly organised underground network of small cells of activists, making it difficult for spies to get among them. Police chiefs were on the hunt for sorely needed intelligence after three incendiary bomb attacks on Debenhams shops in Harrow, Luton and Romford. Activists had planted the bombs because the shops were selling fur products. The attacks had reputedly caused millions of pounds' worth of damage. Lambert identified the perpetrators to his handlers. The intelligence was so precise that the police caught them red-handed. The Old Bailey heard how police raided a flat in Tottenham and found two activists sitting at a table covered with dismantled alarm clocks, bulbs and electrical equipment for making four more firebombs. The prosecution told the court that Andrew Clarke, then 25, and Geoff Shepherd, then 31, were wearing gloves to conceal their fingerprints. The bombs were made in large matchboxes, with a warning: \"Do not touch. Ring police. Animal Liberation Front.\" Shepherd was jailed for four years and four months, and Clarke for more than three years. But his feat also went down in SDS legend because Lambert had skilfully disguised that he was the source of the tip-off, managing to throw the suspicions on to others within the small ring of activists who knew about the attacks. So well had he retained the trust of the activists that Jenny remembers that he went, with her, to visit one of the accused in jail while they were awaiting the trial. Jenny remembers that after the arrests, Bob would often say that special branch was hot on his and other activists' trails. There was, he says, a \"big crisis\" because the animal rights campaigners suspected that there was an informer in their midst. A bizarre incident happened at about that time. By 1988, Jenny had moved into a Hackney flat with two others, who were not politically active. One day, special branch detectives raided Jenny's home, letting slip that they were \"looking for Bob\". He was not there. She remembers that one of the detectives picked up a pair of shoes and asked who owned them. They belonged to Jenny. The raid, the Guardian understands, was orchestrated by police to bolster Lambert's cover story. After more than a year together, Jenny felt that Bob had given her the right signals that he was interested in having children with her. He had been to see her parents three times. But when she broached the question, he said no, upsetting her hugely. She wrote in her diary that it was a black day. \"I remember crying a lot that day. I was just so shocked.\" Soon afterwards, she says, Bob began to tell her that he would have to go on the run abroad to escape the special branch. Over the last few months of 1988, they discussed what to do. She said she wanted to go with him, but he said she should not. According to Jenny, he argued that she should not waste her life on the run, constantly looking over her shoulder, and that she deserved better – a rewarding career and a family. \"He said he was not good enough for me.\" He left his flat and stayed for a couple of weeks in what she called a \"safe house\" with one of her friends in London. She remembers meeting him once there: there was \"still a lot of electricity between us\". In December 1988, Bob and Jenny spent a week alone together in a friend's house in Dorset to say goodbye. \"I was heartbroken. Even when he left, I could not imagine that it had finished because we loved each other so much. I wanted to go on the run with him. I was prepared to do that for him.\" But his sacrifice in not taking her with him made her admire him even more. He said he was going to Spain. In early 1989, she received a long letter from him in Valencia, saying he was not coming back but raising the possibility that she could join him there. \"Even then I could not believe it,\" she says. It was the last she heard from him. The drawn-out goodbye was a ruse. His trip to Spain and the postmark on that letter was genuine, but the reasons were not. Bob's undercover tour was ending and he needed to leave the activists without arousing suspicions. Using standard tradecraft, he had created the perception of a convincing reason for his departure – that special branch were after him. The Spanish bolthole was far enough away to deter activists from going to see him, and avoid the risk of their bumping into him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/07/bnfl-director-book-sellafield-cancer-concerns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-07T21:24:39Z","webTitle":"BNFL memoir revives nuclear safety fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/07/bnfl-director-book-sellafield-cancer-concerns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/07/bnfl-director-book-sellafield-cancer-concerns","fields":{"headline":"BNFL memoir revives nuclear safety fears","bodyText":"The autobiography of a former director of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) is likely to reignite fears about the safety of nuclear power, as Britain prepares for a new generation of reactors, by exposing the panic that rocked the industry two decades ago when a link was suggested between radiation and childhood leukaemia. At its height, workers at Sellafield were advised not to have children, while bosses at the Cumbrian nuclear complex even proposed establishing a sperm bank or calling for \"radiation volunteers\" from among older workers in order to reduce levels of exposure for workers of child-bearing age. The Tenth Child, by Harold Bolter, a former chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association, reveals the extent of concern within the industry following a damaging report into clusters of illness around the Cumbrian reprocessing facility in the 1990s. It comes as Britain prepares to build up to half a dozen nuclear power stations, some of them possibly sited in that area. Greenpeace said last night that there should be a major review of nuclear plants before any decision was made to construct new ones. Ben Ayliffe, senior energy campaigner, said: \"The nuclear industry has a long history of evasion and dishonesty … Greenpeace is reviving its call for a public inquiry into all impacts of nuclear power – including health effects.\" Bolter, a former BNFL director, describes as a \"public relations disaster\" comments by Roger Berry, then director of health and safety at the company, that some staff at Sellafield should make sacrifices to protect the health of future generations following a study by Professor Martin Gardner, published in 1990, that had suggested a link between external radiation received by male staff at Sellafield and the development of cancer among their children. Pressed for a response to the report, Berry told reporters: \"It may be that the proper advice is if you are so worried then maybe you do not have a family.\" He is also said to have earlier suggested that the company establish a sperm bank or called for \"radiation volunteers\" from among older workers. Bolter says he publicly repudiated Berry's comments, claiming they were not company policy and promising BNFL would offer medical counselling to Sellafield staff. \"Once again, I had been forced to make company policy on the hoof, as it were, under pressure,\" Bolter writes in his book. \"There was no time to consult anyone or to get approval. I didn't know what the chief executive or chairman's reaction would be, although I was sure Roger Berry wouldn't like what I said.\" He goes on: \"Roger Berry felt badly let down. I tried to explain to him that what I'd said was the only way to protect the company – and probably his career as wellfor that matter.\" BNFL, which has now been dismantled, handed over management of Sellafield to a group of private contractors including Areva of France. The book has been published just as Britain prepares to build a new generation of atomic power plants for the first time in 30 years in an attempt to improve energy security and help beat climate change. The debate around the risk of nuclear power to public health gradually died down, partly as a result of a test case in the high court where BNFL was cleared of causing cancers in two women whose fathers had worked at Sellafield. But more recently the issue has again been raised by government-funded research, known as the KiKK study, which appeared to show an increased risk of cancer in children under five years living near nuclear power plants in Germany. Janine Allis-Smith, one of the women who took BNFL to court after her son contracted leukaemia, said last night the Bolter book and the KiKK study demanded a wider debate in Britain. \"With the government about to embark on a series of new nuclear power stations – including in Cumbria – it is time this health issue was properly looked at again. I have been trying to raise it for many years but it has just been pushed under the carpet again and again,\" she argued. \"Many people in this area [Cumbria] do not want to know because they want to retain their jobs at Sellafield. Comare [the committee looking into radiation and public health] is working on a report but it may not be out before the go-ahead is given for new plants, which I think is appalling.\" Dr Ian Fairlie, an independent consultant who is writing a book on radiation risks and who has previously advised government departments, said the KiKK report was authoritative as it had been commissioned by the German government and its findings had been verified by them.He said: \"In my view, the KiKK report is a showstopper for the government's plans for more nuclear power stations. It's impossible to justify killing children near nuclear power plants: there are many safer ways to generate electricity.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/jan/25/michael-white-diary-more-or-less","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-25T00:15:00Z","webTitle":"Michael White's Diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jan/25/michael-white-diary-more-or-less","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/jan/25/michael-white-diary-more-or-less","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"• George Osborne and his acolytes routinely claim that the City of London, to which ministers of all parties defer almost as much as they do to Rupert Murdoch, contributes a stonking 20% of all UK taxes.

Water in a pool for storing spent fuel was reaching boiling point, raising the possibility that spent fuel rods could be exposed in turn releasing further radiation, said an official from the nuclear safety agency. \"We cannot leave this alone and we must take care of it as quickly as possible,\" said the official, Hidehiko Nishiyama. Days after Japanese authorities reported abnormal levels of radiation in milk, some vegetables and tap water, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said high levels of radioactivity had been found in seawater near the facility, raising fears that seafood has also been contaminated. The power company said seawater samples contained levels of radioactive iodine 126.7 times the allowed limit, and caesium 24.8 times over. The firm said the quantities posed no immediate threat to health. \"You would have to drink [the seawater] for a whole year just in order to accumulate one millisievert [of radiation],\" a Tepco official said. Background radiation from substances in the air and soil generally emit between one and 10 mSv a year. The source of the contamination has yet to be established, but officials believe it probably came from the tonnes of seawater that have been sprayed over overheating reactors and fuel rod pools in recent days. The Fukushima prefectural government said no marine products from the region had been distributed after the earthquake. Any evidence that contamination has spread to seafood would add further misery to the region's food producers. About 6,000 residents of a village near the plant have been told not to drink tap water, while a ban has been imposed on shipments of milk, spinach, and kakina – a leafy vegetable – produced in the area. The government said it had no plans to extend a 20km (12-mile) evacuation zone around the nuclear plant, despite elevated radiation readings outside the area. \"At the moment, there is no need to expand the evacuation area,\" the government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, told a briefing. The government's latest readings, taken 10km outside the evacuation zone, show radiation levels of 110 microsieverts per hour, higher than normal background levels but well below those deemed a risk to health. The Kyodo news agency quoted International Atomic Energy Agency data showing that radiation levels 1,600 times higher than normal had been detected in a now-evacuated residential area near the crippled atomic plant. According to agency inspectors, radiation levels of 161 microsieverts per hour were detected in the town of Namie, about 20km away. Amid growing concerns over food safety, Japanese authorities are reportedly considering a wider ban on the shipment of certain foodstuffs from the affected region. \"They're going to have to take some decisions quickly in Japan to shut down and stop food being used completely from zones which they feel might be affected,\" Gregory Hartl, a World Health Organisation spokesman, told Associated Press in Geneva. The WHO said the long-term effects on health from contaminated food was of greater concern that the spread of radioactive particles in the air. \"A week ago we were more concerned about purely the radiation leakages and possible explosion of the nuclear facility itself, but now other issues are getting more attention, including the food safety issue,\" Hartl said. \"Repeated consumption of certain products is going to intensify risks, as opposed to radiation in the air that happens once, and then the first time it rains there's no longer radiation in the air.\" The WHO said the spread of radiation into the food supply was more serious than it had first thought, although it added that no tainted products had reached overseas markets. Japan is an exporter of seafood, fruit and vegetables, and dairy products, with Hong Kong, China and the US its biggest markets. China, Taiwan and South Korea said they would tighten screening of Japanese imports. Workers at the Fukushima plant have attached power cables to all six reactors and started pumping water into one of them in an attempt to prevent overheating fuel rods from reaching the potentially catastrophic meltdown phase. \"There are signs of light that we are getting out of this crisis,\" the prime minister, Naoto Kan, was quoted as saying. But that optimism was tempered by the sight of what appeared to be steam rising from the No 2 reactor and smoky haze above the No 3 reactor. The latter has given particular cause for concern because it contains plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel – or MOX – and would release highly toxic plutonium in the event of a meltdown. Tepco officials said the emissions had temporarily halted work to cool off the reactors. The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami continued to rise on Tuesday, as more bodies were retrieved from the vast stretch of coastline hit by the tsunami. Police said 8,928 people had been confirmed dead and a further 12,664 were missing. Various estimates have put the current death toll at nearer 18,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/14/councils-nuclear-assessments-bias","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-14T15:23:59Z","webTitle":"Councils concerned nuclear assessment hand-outs would create bias","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/14/councils-nuclear-assessments-bias","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/14/councils-nuclear-assessments-bias","fields":{"headline":"Councils concerned nuclear assessment hand-outs would create bias","bodyText":"Local authorities are concerned that relying on cash hand-outs from companies to assess applications to build nuclear reactors and other major projects \"creates a sense of bias\", the head of the government's new planning quango has told the Guardian. Sir Michael Pitt, chairman of the Infrastructure Planning Commission, which came into operation this month, also admitted that some local authorities are struggling to secure the funds they need to do the work. Under the government's new planning regime, a developer pays a local authority to review its own application after the two sides agree how much it will cost. With an estimated £200bn of new energy infrastructure required over the next decade, local authorities do not have the resources or expertise to assess applications, particularly complex ones to build nuclear reactors. The Local Government Association and local authorities unsuccessfully lobbied for public funds to be made available or for all developers to be required to contribute money into a \"blind\" pool, which officials could tap. Sir Michael said: \"A number of authorities have said to me that they feel concerned that they are seen by their local public to have received funding from the applicant that is promoting the project, and whether that creates a sense of bias, and that is obviously a consideration.\" Asked if they felt compromised by the funding arrangement, he admitted: \"That is what they said to me.\" He added that some local authorities were having difficulty securing enough funding. \"I know of one or two examples where local authorities have argued forcibly with the [project] promoters that [a funding] agreement should be entered into. I have come across difficult conversations between applicants and promoters.\" But he insisted it would count against a developer if the IPC feels that local authorities have not been able to do all the necessary work as a result of a shortage of funds. \"An application that comes to the Commission where major issues do not appear to be addressed would mean the application is not accepted or if it is accepted, during the evaluation process Commissioners would be asking the same questions the local authority have asked a year earlier.\" EDF Energy has submitted its first planning report for a new reactor at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, which it claims will be operational by the end of 2017. The Conservatives have promised to abolish the IPC if it is elected, but they have not said whether they would change the way a developer pays a local authority to review its own application. The Conservatives claim that local interests will be overruled by a centralised \"undemocratic\" planning body such as the IPC, which, rather than the secretary of state, will make the final decision on whether to approve an application."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/sep/19/russia-putin-trade-human-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-18T23:06:19Z","webTitle":"We mustn't let the lure of trade blind us to Russia's failings | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/19/russia-putin-trade-human-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/19/russia-putin-trade-human-rights","fields":{"headline":"We mustn't let the lure of trade blind us to Russia's failings","bodyText":"During the cold war, Russian dissidents tended to be intellectuals: poets, artists, scientists. Mikhail Khodorkovsky does not fit that pattern. He is one of a post-Soviet generation of businessmen who acquired lucrative shareholdings in state enterprises in exchange for supporting the former president, Boris Yeltsin. Most Russians consider that deal a colossal theft of public assets. The beneficiaries became known as the oligarchs. Now Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail, convicted of fraud in 2005 and facing new charges that would see him imprisoned for another 20 years. His fate reveals a lot about the direction Russia has taken in the decade since Vladimir Putin took power. Mr Putin offered the country's media and energy barons a deal. They could keep some of their wealth if they renounced any ambitions to meddle in politics. Most acquiesced; Mr Khodorkovsky did not, seeking to fund liberal trends in an increasingly authoritarian, nationalist climate. That is why he lost his freedom. Writing in today's Observer, he describes himself as a political prisoner and calls on Britain to challenge Russia on human rights and corruption. Many Russians would question the authority of a former oligarch in passing moral judgments. Khodorkovsky is no Solzhenitsyn. But the thrust of his argument is sound. The Kremlin exercises power capriciously and without regard for the rule of law. At the domestic level, that makes for individual tales of injustice. At the global level, it poses a strategic threat. Russia is a nuclear power and a major supplier of energy to Europe. Britain alone cannot change the course of Russia's political development. But it can resist the temptation to ignore abuses of power in exchange for investment favours. Mr Putin, now exercising control as prime minister, believes his country's economic and strategic interests are only harmed by political pluralism. His European trading partners, Britain included, must never cease to remind him that he is wrong."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/20/japan-success-fragility","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-20T00:04:18Z","webTitle":"Behind all the success lay Japan's sense of its own fragility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/20/japan-success-fragility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/20/japan-success-fragility","fields":{"headline":"Behind all the success lay Japan's sense of its own fragility","bodyText":"The triple disaster in Japan – earthquake, tsunami, radioactive leaks – has, in addition to the natural human sympathy for the Japanese people, produced an outpouring of forecasts about possible implications for the world economy. Yet, as the recent, indeed ongoing, financial crisis should have brought to the fore, economics and finance should be the servant of the world, not its master. I've lost count of the number of assessments I have read about the consequences for the Japanese yen, the world \"supply chain\" (globalisation and \"just in time\" production can manifest their downsides at times such as this), the future of nuclear power and ordinary power, and policies towards climate change etc. One striking aspect of the reaction is the frequency with which commentators refer back to 1945, the end of the second world war, and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All this is by way of reminding oneself, and readers unfamiliar with Japan, how vulnerable that country has felt ever since. Europe benefited from Marshall aid, and from the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (later to become the OECD). Japan also benefited from US reconstruction efforts, and was indeed, under General MacArthur and others, a kind of US satrapy for many years. When, in the late 1970s, I made the first of many visits to Japan, there was a kind of mystique attached by the west to the economy and the people. Having been considered a producer of rather second-rate machines and goods, the economy was gaining admiration for the quality of its products. Into the 1980s, Japan became the envy of the rest of the G7, its ministry of overseas trade being credited with possessing magical powers. \"How do the Japanese do it?\" was a frequently asked question. Meanwhile, Japan had been the object of much hostile criticism from the rest of the G7 for its allegedly mercantilist approach to overseas trade; in the US, which had helped to prop it up after the war, Japan became an object of hostility and fear for its perceived economic success. But Japanese policymakers turned out to have no secret formula. They worked hard, moved from imitation to invention, and supplied the world with many familiar products. And it is arguable that Japanese management techniques, and investment in the UK, was arguably as important as anything done by the Thatcher government in improving Britain's industrial performance after the monetarist devastation of the early 1980s. Yet Japanese economic policymakers still felt they were running a siege economy, vulnerable to disruption because of the country's paltry endowment of natural resources and dependence on imported oil. Hence the aggressive approach to exporting, to pay for imported energy, and the investment in nuclear energy. Then came some major macro-economic policy errors. Obvious comparisons are being made with the Kobe earthquake of January 1995 and the remarkable reconstruction effort. But before that there had been an asset price boom whose collapse caused the kind of \"balance sheet recession\" with which other members of the G7 have become familiar. And the economic policy machine committed the fatal error of almost doubling VAT that year and stifling an economic recovery, thereby making a major contribution to the \"lost decade\". This was followed by what seemed to be the start of another \"lost decade\", and all the talk about the chronic sluggishness of the Japanese economy, which persisted right up to this month's events. Yet it was on a visit to Japan in the late 1990s that I first heard the term \"golden recession\": decades were being \"lost\", but at a high standard of living. Which brings me to one of many interesting points made by the retiring president of the Bundesbank, Dr Axel Weber, in a speech in London recently to the annual dinner of the Society of Business Economists. Having had some fun with the contrast between German and UK growth and inflation in 2010 – German growth 3.5%, inflation 1.25%; UK growth 1.25%, inflation 3.5% – he then tried to cool some of the German euphoria, urging his audience to be suspicious of \"growth numbers\" and look at \"levels\". Germany would not be back to pre-crisis levels until the end of 2011, he added. \"It's not a success story. It's three lost years.\" Then came the killer line: \"The long-term trend rate of growth for the German economy is 1%. That's not a dynamic driver of the European economy.\" This brings us back to the economy and finance as the servant of the people. In Nomura's comprehensive report \"Europe Will Work\", John Llewellyn and Peter Westaway remind us, in the midst of emergency meetings about the eurozone, that \"it was known at its inception that the euro area had design flaws, including a lack of fiscal union, and no mechanisms to deal with asymmetric shocks or diverging competitiveness. However, political factors trumped economic concerns and thereby… the single currency was at root a political project.\" They think the political will is there to resolve the crisis. One of their charts shows how German export competitiveness has benefited, vis-a-vis Italy and others, within the eurozone. The question is can some of the peripheral states stand the strain of Germany's strict conditions for help?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/oct/15/ed-miliband-sheffield-forgemasters-loan","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-15T11:17:00Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband hits out at axing of Sheffield Forgemasters loan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/15/ed-miliband-sheffield-forgemasters-loan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/oct/15/ed-miliband-sheffield-forgemasters-loan","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband hits out at axing of Sheffield Forgemasters loan","bodyText":"Ed Miliband today criticised the coalition government's axing of an £80m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, urging ministers to continue to think how they could help the company, which needs funds to manufacture components for new nuclear power plants. The Labour leader made the remarks on a visit to the Sheffield steelmaker the day after Vince Cable, the business secretary, told MPs that the loan was not affordable, which was why it had been included in a £10.5bn package of projects scrapped or suspended just months after they had been announced towards the end of the last Labour government. Miliband, who had condemned the withdrawal of promised funds during his first conference as the head of his party last month, said the loan should have remained in place. \"I think they made the wrong decision, absolutely. It was a loan, it was a loan that would have been paid back. They have made the decision and I hope they continue to think about how they can help in the future from the funds available.\" The Labour leader said he hoped the company could get the investment it needed. \"It is a fantastic British company and I was incredibly impressed by what I saw there today,\" Miliband said. Yesterday the Commons business select committee heard that of the 241 projects reassessed by the government, 217 were going ahead, 12 were being postponed and just 12 were being cancelled. The cuts would save between £1bn and £2bn, it was told. Cable previously agreed that the loan to Forgemasters was good value for money but he stressed yesterday that the scale of the cuts the government needed to make was due to the state of the economy it inherited. He said: \"It would have been straight cash out of the door in the financial year.\" Cable said in a memorandum sent to the committee in August that the decision was based on affordability. The loan would probably have gone through if the government had been operating in an environment \"where there were no budgetary constraints\". The memorandum also said the government would look to see how it might help the company \"when the future availability of public funds becomes clearer\". The decision has been particularly controversial for Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, whose constituency is in Sheffield."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/17/fukushima-nuclear-threat-expats-leave","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-17T15:25:58Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear threat: expats agonise over leaving Sendai","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/fukushima-nuclear-threat-expats-leave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/17/fukushima-nuclear-threat-expats-leave","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear threat: expats agonise over leaving Sendai","bodyText":"As he waited in the evacuation centre Kevin Williams had to choose between fear and love: a nuclear power plant in multiple-meltdown mode or a Japanese girlfriend he intended to marry. The English teacher (who asked for his name to be changed) had a seat to safety on a bus out of the exclusion zone around the Fukushima nuclear plant. With the radiation threat growing, it would be sensible to flee. But his partner, Satomi, could not join him because she could not leave her family. He had a short time to decide. Williams was not the only one facing a dilemma among the crowd of several dozen expats and travellers in the lobby of the Sendai ANA Holiday Inn. Closed for normal business, the hotel had been converted into a temporary UK consulate complete with a union flag draped over a registration table. For the first time, it was also serving as an exit out of Japan's widening disaster zone. The consulate had announced it would lay on buses for British nationals and the other foreigners who had endured a week like no other in history, with a massive earthquake, devastating tsunami, catastrophic failure of nuclear reactors, and worsening shortages of fuel and food. \"We've had a week of no water, no kerosene, so we stink and we're cold. There is no transportation so we feel our options closing,\" said Paul Harris, who had lived in Sendai for 20 years, and was leaving with his Japanese partner, Kayoko Ono. \"It hurts to leave. This is home and we will be back. If it weren't for the problems at the power plant, things would get back to normal here. But officials don't seem confident it will go well.\" Such inconveniences pale beside the suffering of the 430,000 Japanese refugees made homeless by the tsunami. Many of them are huddled in temporary shelters with poor sanitation, little food and insufficient blankets and heating despite plunging outdoor temperatures. But fears of radioactivity and worsening shortages have prompted many countries to advise their citizens in north Japan to leave. Some are organising evacuations from near the Fukushima nuclear plant. China has already withdrawn its nationals. The US, Canada and Australia are expected to do the same. The contrast with Japan's response is striking. Residents of southern Sendai go about their business as usual, wandering around in the snow that blows from the direction of the distressed power plant only about 50 miles away. Individuals are also taking action. Matthew Selingham, a human rights lawyer from Wimbledon, London, had arrived just 11 hours earlier from the UK to rescue his wife, Hiromi ,and daughter, Daisy. \"As soon as I saw the disaster on television on Friday, I went to Heathrow. ANA put me straight on a plane so I could rush here to give them a hug,\" Selingham said. \"I love Japan. It feels terrible to leave. We should stick with them, but there is so much pressure from home. I'm getting messages from friends saying 'run! run!' and offers to pay my fare.\" With a return flight to London booked the same evening, he hoped his family would soon be safely back in the UK. But he was interrupted by a consular official, calling people together for an update on Britain's travel advice. The announcement underlined the growing sense of alarm. The UK had accepted Japan's exclusion zone of about 20 miles around the failing nuclear reactors. But this changed overnight because of the deteriorating situation: \"As an additional precautionary measure British nationals are advised to remain outside an 80km radius of the Fukushima nuclear facility. This is in line with the advice issued by the US government to its citizens.\" The widening of the exclusion zone brought immediate consequences for the crowd. \"This will affect us. Unfortunately, we will not be able to go directly. It may take an extra day,\" said one person. The pressure to leave is immense, but many are conflicted. Abigail Bailey, a 19-year-old from Little Hadham, Hertfordshire, was in Japan for a year off before university. She was reluctant to leave a school job she had quickly come to enjoy. \"It was a really hard decision to leave the kids I teach. If it was up to me and the travel advice hadn't changed, I would have stayed. But my family left 20 messages telling me to get on a bus. It wasn't a suggestion, it was an order.\" Leaving though is a privilege. Most of the Japanese people in the shelters are trapped by a lack of petrol, a shortage that has also made it difficult to distribute food. It was thought the consulate might provide further buses; 85 people left on Thursday. Ultimately, Williams was not among them, though he admitted he was tempted to go. \"I had a moment of panic. It's very easy to get swept up in the mood of crisis. But there is no way I'm leaving my wonderful, wonderful, girlfriend,\" he said. Satomi seemed determined not to put him at risk. \"Please convince him he must go,\" she urged her friends. But his mind was made up. The couple would remain on the border of the exclusion zone. \"We'll have to be careful and stay indoors,\" Williams said. \"I'll admit it's pretty scary, but it would be scarier to think that she's here on her own. Could anyone leave the person they love?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/20/old-plants-affect-nuclear-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-20T18:48:10Z","webTitle":"Crumbling stores, leaky plants and the dangers of old age | Terry Macalister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/20/old-plants-affect-nuclear-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/20/old-plants-affect-nuclear-safety","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear industry: Crumbling stores, leaky plants and the dangers of old age","bodyText":"Dealing with the problems of old age lies at the heart of the nuclear industry's challenge to convince the public of its safety: leaky power plants, crumbling waste stores nearing the end of their lives and overworked inspectors who do not have the time to assess properly the next generation of power stations. Even with billions of pounds a year being poured into clean-up operations, it is a toxic legacy going back to the cold war that continually threatens to undermine the facelift given by the new private sector companies. The companies, mainly from France and Germany, have joined the government to try to convince the public it is time for a nuclear renaissance, on both energy security and climate change grounds. In recent days the industry watchdog, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), has admitted that the possibility of a serious accident at Britain's biggest nuclear complex, Sellafield in Cumbria, is still \"far too high\", while questioning the safety designs of new reactors being submitted for approval. The private sector managers who took over at Sellafield less than a year ago have been told in a letter that they should reduce the risks at the radioactive storage pond dubbed \"Dirty 30\" and elsewhere as soon as possible. The harsh assessment by the NII was revealed by one of its inspectors, Mark Foy, at a meeting of local stakeholders who live around the area of the plant. \"We are concerned that the risk of a major event caused by further degradation of legacy plants, or increased time at risk due to deferrals, is far too high,\" said Foy. \"We have written to Sellafield Ltd to advise that every effort should be given to addressing and reducing the risks at the earliest possibility.\" The warning comes months after the Observer revealed an internal NII report that detailed 1,767 leaks, breakdowns and other mishaps around the atomic industry over the last seven years. While most were small in nature they are nonetheless worrying and undermine the cheerful message from the Nuclear Industry Association that safety of UK plants is \"second to none\". Sellafield itself was fined £2m in 2006 after 80,000 tonnes of acid contaminated with 20 tonnes of uranium and 160kg of plutonium escaped from a broken pipe into what it calls \"secondary containment\". The fine was relatively heavy because the leak was going on for eight months before it was detected. Sellafield is now being run by Nuclear Management Partners, a consortium of Areva of France, URL Washington Group of the US and Amec of Britain. They have let it be known privately that they expect to make some £10m each this year as bonus payments under the contract they hold for clearing up the site and reducing costs. They said safety took \"the highest priority\" at Sellafield, but they admit that decommissioning is a slow process and any delays could leave the risk there \"unacceptable\". The admonishment from the NII is a particular embarrassment for Areva, which has run into trouble with the same organisation over the approval of its European Pressurised Reactor design. The largely state-owned French power company EDF wants to build four new EPRs in Britain, but the NII, part of the Health and Safety Executive, is questioning the design's safety. \"We have serious concern about your proposal, which allows lower safety class systems or manual controls to [override] higher safety class systems,\" it says in a letter, suggesting the operating and safety mechanisms should be able to operate independently. Finnish regulators have also questioned this aspect of an EPR being built at Olkiluoto. The NII is questioning both Areva and a rival company, Westinghouse, about how their designs would stand up to a 9/11-style attack from the air. Nuclear industry executives recognise the importance of public confidence over safety and security but remain aware of the long shadows cast by the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents in the 1980s and 1990s, which destroyed public confidence. In the UK, Sellafield, then-called Windscale, suffered a significant fire in 1957, but the many hundreds of minor accidents since have kept concern high. The Environment Agency this year won a prosecution of Magnox Electric Ltd for allowing a radioactive leak to continue for 14 years without being detected at the Bradwell plant in Essex. Mike Weightman, the head of the NII, said at the time it was simply not possible to \"inspect or check every feature of a complex plant\". However, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that the \"HSE has struggled to recruit sufficient nuclear safety inspectors.\" There are currently 166 staff but the requirement for regulating existing facilities is 192. \"This would leave the NII with one of the lowest ratios of inspectors to plant in the world,\" Weightman admitted in a report. Furthermore, to assess new reactor designs, Weightman says he needs a further 36 inspectors, to bring the complement up to 228 by 2011. Another issue is that a quarter of all British nuclear inspectors will be over 60 within the next \"two to three years\", said the NII. But it is not just the personnel that are growing old. \"Ageing issues apply across all areas of existing nuclear plant,\" said the report, Briefing on the Nuclear Programme, which was drafted in January but later amended. In particular, \"Sellafield continues to provide significant challenge, especially in the operational fragility of some of its radioactive waste treatment plant and the lack of progress in decommissioning the highly hazardous redundant plant\". The document also shows the number of \"safety events\" across the years. The total is 1,767 but 1,292 are on the lowest scale of risk under the International Nuclear Event Scale, a safety classification developed post-Chernobyl. Five of them come under the second-highest ranking and almost half – 858 – were judged to have been serious enough \"to have had the potential to challenge a nuclear safety system\". A DECC spokesman said: \"The UK's nuclear safety regime is acknowledged to be one of the most stringent in the world, and the UK nuclear industry has a strong safety record. The same rigour will apply to a new generation of nuclear power. There is no room for complacency and the fact that all incidents, however minor, are reported to the authorities and the public is a sign of a rigorous, transparent safety regime.\" Additional reporting by Rob Edwards • This article was amended on Thursday 22 October 2009. The British partner in the Nuclear Management Partners consortium is Amec, not Amex as we had it.

What do you do, sir?\" as John Maynard Keynes is supposed to have told some lesser mortal who dared to challenge the great economist. But what if the facts haven't changed and the coalition has got cold feet over a policy because loutish Tory backbenchers and their loutish tabloid allies have got upset? That seems to be the case over Downing Street's briefing that Ken Clarke is being told to rethink his plans to cut prison sentences via a discount scheme in return for early guilty pleas. Theresa May was on the air today, insisting there's been a routine \"consultation\" in the wake of the justice secretary's green paper last autumn and that the change isn't a U-turn. No 10 and even KC's old sparring partner Michael \"hang 'em high\" Howard agree. Well, U-turn is an overworked cliche, beloved of the armchair generals who pontificate in newspapers but, as policy revisions go, this one looks like the real deal. What's more, it's a switch over a policy to which David Cameron and his cabinet signed up enthusiastically only last year. That sounds familiar, doesn't it? Cameron and Nick Clegg also wrote the foreword to Andrew Lansley's white paper on NHS reforms, from which they are now retreating like the Italian army in the face of gunfire from all quarters. This is becoming a hallmark of the coalition. Why? Partly because it's a coalition that is pulled in both directions – by Lib Dem pinkos and Tory reactionaries – and a third way by voters who want better services, more people in jail and lower taxes. But it is also ideological or, rather, ideology-lite. Cameron's pragmatism means he sometimes expresses strong views but holds those views weakly, the opposite of some politicians – newspapers and voters too, let's not let them off the hook – who have weak views but express them vehemently until they change their mind or move on. Thus the Daily Mail (wrongly dismissed as a \"bigoted comic\" by Speaker John Bercow; it's better than that but they do deserve each other) has already moved on from the Clarke controversy. It relegates the news of his retreat, triggered by its own initial onslaught, to the bottom of page 13 this morning. In summary, Clarke was asked to gouge a huge £2bn out of his £8.7bn justice budget and thought he'd find £130m of it by embracing a discount policy initially proposed by Oliver \"Four Brains\" Letwin that would save the courts money – fewer costly trials – and save expensive prison places by cutting sentences in return for guilty pleas. It is a truly shocking fact that there are three million Americans in jail today, but pretty shocking, too, that our own prison population has been allowed to double to 85,000 in recent decades as both main parties engaged in a \"tough on crime\" bidding war. At 150 prisoners per 100,000 people, England and Wales come 92nd in the global league – Scotland is 99th at 141 per 100,000, Ulster 160th at 78 – a long way behind the US (743) and Russia (571). Locking up the seriously bad guys, violent and unrepentant, then mislaying the keys strikes me as sensible. But a lot of people shouldn't be there, certainly most drug offenders, as we've started discussing again lately. The university of crime is also a Russell Group university of Islamist extremism, so we've also noticed – again – this week. So Clarke was surely on the right track if politicians and judges could summon up enough common sense to implement a less severe policy sensibly while avoiding their reciprocal hobby of second-guessing each other and bickering in public. George Osborne would have saved a few bob in the process, 10,000 sentences would have been cut and an estimated 3,400 fewer people would have been inside one of Her Majesty's hotels. The use of indeterminate sentences for public protection would have been sharply curtailed, and remand in custody ended in cases where a jail sentence would be unlikely. I'm sure the trade – judges, lawyers and victims' groups – had some legitimate complaints, and that details could have been tweaked to address them. But, despite No 10 briefing what a \"massive amount of respect\" the PM has for Clarke, this isn't a mere tweak. Ed Miliband is indicating that he'd be moving on the \"coalition soft on crime\" front: naughty Ed, that's a manoeuvre straight out of despised Tony Blair's playbook. Cameron himself is now promising to burnish his own tough credentials in a speech next month, just as he love-bombed the NHS in a speech signalling a U-turn on health reforms only yesterday, this time in a pinko direction. Of course, Clarke made himself vulnerable last month when he tried to suggest that some rapes are more \"serious\" than others. Though a little tactless, this statement of the blindingly obvious united younger feminists and the Sun in an unholy alliance, naivety and cynicism making a powerful coalition. Only last week I asked an audience of 120 women with whom I was discussing politics if any of them had been offended, and got no takers. In her Sunday Times column, India Knight pointed out that guilty pleas would also relieve rape victims of the trauma of reliving their nightmare in court, in the presence of their often still aggressive attacker. Never mind, the \"Sack Ken\" lobby tasted blood, and Cameron sensibly decided it wouldn't be his own. As Alastair Campbell shrewdly noted in a speech to the nurses' spring conference in Liverpool, the coalition isn't tough like Margaret Thatcher in her prime – it bends to pressure. He's right. Is that what we want? We say we do, but we're ambiguous. Don't we pay these folk to decide things for us? Yes. Interestingly enough, in her Times column this week, the shrewd Rachel Sylvester makes another telling point about the evolution of the Cameron strategy for governing. Despite brave talk about \"turning Britain's pyramid of power on its head\" by devolving decision-making downwards to the people, Dave has already noticed that the people so entrusted often make bad decisions – let's start with Ken or Andrew Lansley – for which he, not they, will get the blame. The further down it goes, the worse it gets. If the coalition wants to build new homes, let alone new nuclear power stations, it may have to override its own localist agenda, as Eric Pickles demonstrated when he combined his localism bill with a raft of orders to town halls, not least the freeze on council tax. Sylvester quotes a cabinet minister as saying \"there's good localism and bad localism\". Just fancy that, eh! But liberty is the freedom to make bad mistakes and to create postcode lotteries on health, schools, welfare, social housing and all the rest. Lib Dem efforts to rebrand it as \"postcode democracy\" won't work – ministers were warned at the time they'd still get the blame as other people ran for cover – so Cameron is starting to reassert control and direction from the centre, much as New Labour did. As we've noted here before such switches aren't good for credibility. But if he's got time to watch the show unfold, Blair must be chuckling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2009/jul/06/poem-of-the-week-nuclear-susan-wicks","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-06T09:53:24Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: Nuclear by Susan Wicks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/06/poem-of-the-week-nuclear-susan-wicks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/06/poem-of-the-week-nuclear-susan-wicks","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: Nuclear by Susan Wicks","bodyText":"Stephen Spender's famous image of electricity pylons, \"Bare like nude giant girls that have no secret\" (The Pylons) is still bizarrely striking, though questionable (why are those curveless, sexless objects female?) Otherwise, the poem itself seems dated and it's strange to think that, at the time, it prompted a sort of tunnel-vision in some of the commentators on 1930s poetry, leading them to describe the Auden generation as \"Pylon Poets\". Contemporary verse makes room for everything contemporary. Today, there is far less temptation to demonise, as if by reflex, the drably functional machinery of modernity. But what if the \"machinery\" is ethically dubious and potentially destructive? This week's poem, Nuclear, by Susan Wicks, handles its emotive subject rationally and elegantly. The poem reflects the landscape it describes, and the natural and artificial are juxtaposed, but not automatically treated as oppositional. The cooling-towers of the nuclear power-station are among the first objects the reader sees, but they are not dramatically singled out. They are part of a list or group (\"that flash of river light, the bridge\") before the poem registers their presence with a \"first sight gasp\". And still \"the landscape knows them\" and the poem tries to assimilate them without judgement. There are colours in the scene brighter and cruder than their rather appealing \"lit apricot\" – the tangle of red (perhaps a fence?), the turquoise bridge. Even the river \"glitters\", as metal does. The cooling-towers are further domesticated by the striking comparison to a cruet. Are they deadly – or vital to the place and society they serve? Formally, the poem insists on a measured rhythmical pace, and a visual spaciousness that literally makes rooms for ambiguity. The stepped caesurae occur without jolts. Though there are stanza-breaks, and a rhetorically-pointed argument, the poem feels integrated in its form and thought. It is objective and painterly. Having registered the central presence of the cooling-towers, we are invited to study three further, contrasted scenes. The fish-ladder is a benign human intervention into the natural world, affording fish a migratory passage. Here it seems mythical, dream-like – a Jacob's ladder. Next we see the protesting student, brave and ineffectual, and then we are told, shockingly but calmly, about the \"packages of pills\" – two wholly different moral responses to the potential threat. Finally, the speaker takes another look at the view, this time from a private, interior angle. Cock-crow signifies betrayal, but the crowing is also an \"every morning noise\". The unidentified shadows might be sinister: \"finger-flapping\" is a strange, arresting compound verb. Then again, they might simply be playful, mere leaf-shadows resembling those friendly and funny animal-shapes also made by human hands. But does this mean we are safe, and everything is going on as before the power-station was built? The poem resists final certainties. But tension underlies the balancing act – the tension between what we can see and what we don't see. Explaining the background to the poem, Susan Wicks tells me that the power station is Golfech, situated \"on the flood-plain of the Garonne, almost within walking distance of the picturesque village of Auvillar … one of the most beautiful villages in France\". She adds that the villagers had initially opposed the power station, but that she now detected \"a mixed legacy of satisfaction and unease\". The power station and cooling-towers \"had their own surprising beauty, in some ways more real than the 'film set' architectural heritage their money had apparently helped restore and preserve.\" The fish-ladder had been closed at the time of her stay because of a security alert at the plant. Susan Wicks's most recent publication is a translation of the French poet Valerie Rouzeau's book-length sequence Pas Revoir, under the title Cold Spring in Winter (Arc, 2009). \"Nuclear\" is from her forthcoming collection, Aurora Spirit. It was first published in the London Review of Books. Nuclear Each morning as I round the bend, the same shock – that flash of river light, the bridge, the cooling-towers – always that first sight gasp as if they've been dropped there – Yet the landscape knows them: a fragment of old stone moves sideways, and through a tangle of red the river glitters, the bridge spins out its turquoise cobweb and there they stand like a cruet – squat on the flood-plain, lit apricot, steaming quietly into this end of night. I've heard there's a place where fish swim up and down a ladder, mouthing through murk like cruising angels; where a student strung himself up for days from a concrete cliff while the canal sent back his image; where they hand out packages of pills to every household, in case of leaks. But here at my open window the field's rippled with leaves, and blue, the every morning noise of cock-crow, unidentified shadows finger-flapping across."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/232927","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-28T18:15:08Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Bahrain king says Iranian nuclear programme must be stopped","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/232927","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/232927","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Bahrain king says Iranian nuclear programme must be stopped","bodyText":"Wednesday, 04 November 2009, 06:44 S E C R E T MANAMA 000642 NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 11/04/2019 TAGS PREL, MARR, ENRG, BA, AF, IZ, IR, NATO SUBJECT: GENERAL PETRAEUS WITH KING HAMAD: IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, IRAN, NATO AWACS, ENERGY Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli, reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 1. (C) SUMMARY: In an hour-long meeting on November 1 with CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus, Bahrain's King Hamad said Arab states need to do more to engage Iraq, discussed Afghanistan and the positive role India could play, urged action to stop Iran's nuclear program, and reviewed regional plans for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. END SUMMARY. 2.(C) IRAQ: King Hamad fully endorsed General Petraeus's point that increased Arab engagement and influence would help frustrate Iranian designs in Iraq. He added that the Arabs need Egyptian and Saudi leadership in this matter and that he had tried to make this point to the Saudi government, but with little effect. 3.(C) AFGHANISTAN: General Petraeus praised Bahrain's commitment of a police company for internal security at FOB Leatherneck. King Hamad confirmed that he would personally see the force off at the airport on December 16. This date will be the 10th anniversary of the King's assuming the throne, and General Petraeus said that U.S. air assets would be available on the 16th to transport the company to Afghanistan. King Hamad inquired about the extent of India's involvement in Afghanistan and noted that Bahrain saw India as very positive force in the region. \"It's a new era,\" he said. \"They can be of great help.\" 4.(C) IRAN: King Hamad pointed to Iran as the source of much of the trouble in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He argued forcefully for taking action to terminate their nuclear program, by whatever means necessary. \"That program must be stopped,\" he said. \"The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it.\" King Hamad added that in light of these regional developments, Bahrain was working to strengthen GCC coordination and its relations with allies and international organizations. He specifically mentioned NATO and confirmed that Bahrain had agreed to the Alliance's request to use Isa Airbase for AWACS missions, although the detail on numbers and timing have yet to be discussed. 5.(S/NF) BAHRAIN AIR SHOW AND NUCLEAR ENERGY: King Hamad asked General Petraeus for his help in encouraging U.S. aircraft manufacturers to participate in the inaugural Bahrain Air Show, scheduled for January 2010. He said that France was pushing the Rafale and would be there in force, although he agreed with Petraeus that the French fighter was yesterday's technology. Warming to the subject of French commercial diplomacy and referring to President Sarkozy, King Hamad said, \"The UAE will give him a hard time soon,\" over France's proposed deal for nuclear reactors. \"They're not happy with the project he's offered them.\" King Hamad also mentioned that Bahrain was studying options for using nuclear power to generate electricity. He said he had asked the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Public Works to present him recommendations and invited the Ambassador to discuss with them possible U.S. involvement.

Having said that, energy supply is a strategic industry and it cannot be ideal that so little of it remains in domestic hands. Only two of the big six home energy suppliers are UK-controlled and nuclear power operator British Energy was sold to French state-controlled operator EDF two years ago. The French do not take such a relaxed view about their assets. GDF Suez itself was created through a government-brokered mega-merger in 2006 to ward off a hostile bid for Suez from Italy's Enel. Foreign ownership in itself is not a bad thing – the real problem is the short-termist City culture and the lazy, open-door policy adopted by government that has allowed it to become so prevalent.

An extra €2tn (£1.7tn) worth of investment would be needed by the middle of this century but that could easily be outweighed by €2.65tn of fuel cost savings, argues Greenpeace International and the European Renewable Energy Council. The report, Energy (R)evolution: Towards a fully renewable energy supply in the EU, claims a mixture of existing technologies plus the widespread adoption of electric cars and demand reduction initiatives would allow a dramatic change in energy requirements without a huge reduction in quality of life. While the initial cost would be significant, the authors argue that the current model of energy production and use fails to guarantee a secure, sustainable and affordable supply into the future. \"This study shows that investing in green energy will nudge up the cost of electricity in the short to medium term. But it will save trillions of euros in fuel costs alone by 2030 and represents an immediate investment in jobs and energy security,\" says Greenpeace, which points out that its calculations are based on work by the systems analysis and technology assessment department of the German Aerospace Centre in Stuttgart. The report was given credibilitytoday by Germany whose the Federal Environment Agency said it could derive all of its electricity from renewables by 2050. The country already gets 16% of its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable sources – three times higher than the level it achieved 15 years ago. \"A complete conversion to renewable energy by 2050 is possible from a technical and ecological point of view,\" said Jochen Flasbarth, president of the Federal Environment Agency. \"It's a very realistic target based on technology that already exists – it's not a pie-in-the-sky prediction.\" Greenpeace and the renewable energy industry believe the EU needs to develop a wider vision for truly sustainable energy economy for 2050 if it is to make real advances. They say the EU needs to make the 20% target for reducing energy use by 2020 into a legally binding commitment and move towards a 30% cut. European governments are also urged to take control of the main electricity transmission system so renewable energy producers are not discriminated against. The development of a supergrid based on sophisticated IT systems that will balance supply and demand from different energy sources around the Continent is a key part of their wider plans. Subsidies and other support measures for conventional energy sources such as nuclear power and fossil fuels should be phased out so energy prices reflect the more genuine costs, Greenpeace argues. \"For example the nuclear power sector in Europe still benefits from direct subsidies, government loan guarantees, export credit guarantees, government equity input and subsidised in-kind support,\" it argues while saying the EU needs to ensure nuclear waste comes under the \"polluter pays\" principle more fully. The report also calls for the European emissions trading scheme to be restructured with a rapid move away from the free allocation of allowances to polluting industries and higher standards to be introduced covering efficiency of vehicles, consumer products and buildings. In total Greenpeace and the renewable energy sector believe that by 2050 it would be possible to generate 97% of electricity from green sources and create potential annual cost savings of €85bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"edinburgh/2010/nov/26/edinburgh-forest-student-demo-leith-decides-weekend-events","type":"article","sectionId":"edinburgh","sectionName":"Edinburgh","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-26T09:06:12Z","webTitle":"Edinburgh today: Forest Cafe debate, student demo update and Leith Decides","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2010/nov/26/edinburgh-forest-student-demo-leith-decides-weekend-events","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/edinburgh/2010/nov/26/edinburgh-forest-student-demo-leith-decides-weekend-events","fields":{"headline":"Edinburgh today: Forest Cafe debate, student demo update and Leith Decides","bodyText":"Good morning Edinburgh.

This US deal includes significant offensive capabilities – thus the repeated warnings from Tehran about it being \"destabilising\". In public the Saudis and their partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council support using diplomatic means to tackle Iran's alleged nuclear ambitions, but express greater concern behind closed doors, diplomats say. Iran insists it seeks only civilian nuclear power, not weapons. Relations between Washington and Riyadh were badly damaged by the 9/11 attacks and the identification of the Saudi origins of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. But common strategic interests and pressures generated by the arms industry and the recession helped smooth differences. US defence sales to the Gulf doubled from $19bn in 2001-2004 to $40bn in 2005-2008. It is striking that this deal has met little opposition from the pro-Israeli lobbies, which in the past have worked to prevent the Saudis acquiring advanced equipment. Nowadays Saudi Arabia also supports the Arab peace initiative, which offers to recognise Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state. King Abdullah (with Barack Obama, right) is said to have been convinced of the sincerity of the US commitment to Riyadh and pushed the arms request despite his air force wanting to divide sales between the US and Europe. Recent months have seen mounting tensions between Riyadh and Tehran, with Arab regimes pressing the US to adopt a tougher stance. In a meeting with Hillary Clinton in Riyadh in February, foreign minister Saud al-Faisal stated that the Iranian nuclear threat demands \"a more immediate solution\" than sanctions. The package reflects the convergence of the strategic views of the US, Israel and conservative Arab states regarding Iran's alleged nuclear ambitions and bid for regional influence. But Saudi Arabia denies reports it has secretly agreed to allow Israeli planes through its airspace if they were sent to bomb nuclear sites in Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/16/germany-offshore-windfarms","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T16:59:25Z","webTitle":"Is Germany's windfarm dream a load of hot air? | Frank Dohmen and Christian Schwägerl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/16/germany-offshore-windfarms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/16/germany-offshore-windfarms","fields":{"headline":"Is Germany's windfarm dream a load of hot air?","bodyText":"The promise was clear and the path leading to an ambitious goal well defined. The German power industry planned to install wind turbines with a capacity of about 10 gigawatts off Germany's North and Baltic Sea coasts by 2020. This would replace eight large nuclear power plants. The ambitious plan even called for meeting 25% of German electricity requirements with climate-friendly offshore windfarms by 2050. Germany's four major electric utility companies – RWE, E.ON, Vattenfall and EnBW – spearheaded the effort, creating countless glossy brochures for investors and customers that outline their vision for Germany's green future. It consists of hundreds of windfarms, all located 20 to 40km (12.5 to 25 miles) off the German coastlines, which would supply massive amounts of CO2-free electricity to all parts of Germany via specially built high-voltage lines. Millions of households and industrial plants are to be supplied with clean energy generated by wind, which blows constantly at sea. The new era was to be ushered in by the start-up of the Alpha Ventus windfarm last spring. After a brief period of test operation, the electric utility executives ceremoniously announced at the time, additional offshore windfarms would quickly be erected in Germany, eliminating the need for old coal-fired power plants. But little progress has been made since then, at least not in Germany. E.ON and other electric utilities are building one windfarm after the next abroad, but at home their activity has been largely limited to securing licences for areas where they want to operate in domestic waters. In fact, EnBW is the only company so far to have built its own functioning offshore windfarm. EnBW's small Baltic 1 operation in the Baltic Sea has an output of only 48MW and doesn't even come close to that of the Alpha Ventus research windfarm operated by Vattenfall, EWE and E.ON. RWE hasn't even built an offshore facility in Germany yet. And E.ON, one of the biggest operators of offshore windfarms worldwide, plans to decide in the coming months whether to finally approve the investment funds for a large-scale project in the North Sea. The company's board of directors already claimed last year that the funds have been approved. There are good reasons for the companies' hesitation. Behind the scenes, lobbyists for the power industry are trying to convince the German government to agree to better terms for their offshore windfarms. This isn't the first time. Following a crisis meeting two and a half years ago, the industry managed to increase subsidy rates from the 9 cents per kilowatt hour that was originally planned to 15 cents. Now, under the so-called Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) assessment, consumers will be expected to pay more than 18 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity from offshore windfarms. This is three times as much as the price of electricity on spot markets, and more than twice as much as the operators of windfarms on land receive for their green energy. There was nothing new in the arguments that industry executives presented at the environment ministry in Berlin to support the most recent proposed price increase, which are summarised in a study conducted by the management consulting firm KPMG. Industry officials argue, for example, that the demands of environmental and coastal protection assessments are significantly higher and more costly in Germany than in other EU countries. Besides, say the electric utility executives, the rapid connection of windfarms to the power grid is not guaranteed, and many banks are still not prepared to invest money in risky projects designed for the very long term. The industry believes that higher subsidy rates could reverse this obstacle. And to prevent the chorus of outrage from growing too loud, it has come up with what it calls a cost-neutral solution: although the subsidy rate would go up considerably, its duration would be shortened – from about 14 years to nine, according to the current discussion. The total cost, the electricity lobby argues, would therefore remain unchanged for the government and taxpayers. The key difference is that the industry's plan would greatly facilitate bank financing. Otherwise, the plan has no significant benefits or drawbacks. But this is only part of the truth. In the first nine years, at least, electricity customers could expect to see substantially higher EEG assessments on their electricity bills, while the utilities' profits would go up considerably. For them, the implementation of the model would be a real coup. They would receive the government subsidies within a significantly shorter time period and, after nine years, could sell the electricity from the windfarms, which will have been written off by then, at market prices. As a result, the value of the operating companies would rise on the utilities' balance sheets, and so would the profits from the offshore windfarms. According to KPMG calculations, profits would go up from about 7% today to almost 12%. The industry hasn't been able to make such profits with its newly built, conventional coal and natural gas power plants in years. Nevertheless, the German environment ministry can apparently reconcile itself with the model. Its reasons are entirely pragmatic. According to ministry officials, the construction of offshore windfarms is now so far behind schedule that it is a pleasant surprise when anything happens at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/energy-efficiency-siemens-industry-sector","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-07T09:55:20Z","webTitle":"Advice and solutions for energy efficiency are on hand - so get saving","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/energy-efficiency-siemens-industry-sector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/energy-efficiency-siemens-industry-sector","fields":{"headline":"Advice and solutions for energy efficiency are on hand - so get saving","bodyText":"There continues to be a significant amount of commentary from many interested parties around the issues of industrial energy use and carbon impact - with discussions highlighting the general confusion among the business community following high profile environmental summits such as Kyoto and Copenhagen. The danger of lots of talk and little clear direction is that the status quo prevails and many energy users may settle for an ineffective 'business as usual' approach to their energy management and reduction issues. It is imperative to manage demand and reduce energy costs for businesses, and this need will only increase with the attendant benefits of carbon reduction also becoming increasingly important as time progresses. We have proven cases that energy efficiency measures are the fastest and most effective way to reduce costs over the short term. Furthermore, reducing demand will ensure security of supply as traditional coal fired capacity is lost over the coming decade. Demand reduction needs to be balanced with an appropriate move towards renewables as the country seeks to decarbonise energy supply - with new nuclear power stations, carbon capture and storage initiatives, high efficiency generation and transmission, alongside smart grid and smart meter technology. Companies need to access the available range of proven energy reduction technology that offers exceptional returns of payback and adopt a systematic approach in line with EN16001 as the way to maximise energy reductions. Finance hurdles can be cleared through innovative solutions that allow project installations with zero capital investment. The subsequent additional benefits - reduced maintenance, improved system reliability and availability, simplified environmental compliance, lower carbon emissions, enhanced brand value, reduced business risk of energy price shocks or supply failures – make a compelling case to stop the talking and implement action sooner rather than later. So enough of the strategic theory - what can companies practically do? • Implement a recognised energy management process as supported by EN16001 • Use a professional expert audit to establish and benchmark the best options for your business • Establish an effective automatic monitoring and targeting system alongside a robust deployment and education programme for staff • Implement the most effective and proven cost reduction technologies based upon realistic installed cost/benefit calculations – many solutions now offer extremely quick \"payback\" • Consider real 'lifetime costs' in your evaluations - a small saving on the purchase price could have expensive repercussions down the line • Include all elements in the energy efficiency programme such as water, gas, effluent and waste • Consider energy and water as key components in any lean manufacturing or lean office process • Finally, for those organisations covered by CRC EES; did you register by the end of September deadline and how will the latest changes to the CRC payments which are now effectively a \"carbon tax\" affect you? Most organisations will be able to achieve 10 - 30% savings with energy efficiency measures. Though it may not be well understood, the benefits of reducing energy costs equate to around £150 - £200 / tonne of CO2e – as well as the additional (expected) £12 / tonne carbon cost from 2012 following the Government announcement in October of the elimination of the recycling payments - although the exact costs may yet change again. Either way, the message is clear. The need is escalating and the advice and solutions are readily available - so take action and get saving!

The German nuclear waste which had been reprocessed in France left by train from Valognes on Friday and reached its destination 92 hours later as trucks drove it the final 12 miles of its 930-mile journey to Gorleben. It was the longest journey time recorded for the once regular transport, following a 79-hour trip in 2008. The protests by anti-nuclear activists were galvanised after Angela Merkel's government extend the life of Germany's 17 atomic power plants by an average of 12 years. \"Whomever extends the time for atomic power plants, must also count on an extended time for atomic waste transports,\" said Wolfgang Ehmke, a spokesman for protest organisers. Protesters tried to hinder the shipment along the entire route, rappelling off bridges over the train tracks, undermining roads to make them impassable, and forming human shields across the route. A shepherd even herded her flock of 500 sheep and some 60 goats across the road between Dannenberg, where the waste was loaded on to the trucks, and Gorleben in an effort to slow down the transport. In one of the largest mass scuffles, riot police on Sunday tried to stop up to 4,000 protesters going through the woods on to tracks near Dannenberg ahead of the nuclear waste train. Police used water cannons and pepper spray and wrestled with activists to break up the protest, but some still reached the railway line. Nuclear energy has been unpopular since fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine drifted over Germany. On Saturday, at least 25,000 people (organisers gave the figure as more than 50,000) demonstrated peacefully outside Dannenberg in the biggest protest ever against the shipments. Activists say neither the waste containers nor the Gorleben site, a temporary storage facility, are safe. Protests against the regular shipments faded somewhat after a previous government embarked a decade ago on plans to phase out nuclear power entirely by 2021, but this year the chancellor's government decided to extend the life of the nuclear plants. Parliament approved the plan last month. Germany has no plans to build any new nuclear plants, but Merkel has argued atomic power is needed as a \"bridging technology\" to keep energy cheap and available as the country becomes more reliant on renewable sources. Germany receives waste shipments roughly every year under an agreement that involves spent fuel sent to France for reprocessing and returned for storage. Safety measures for the shipment involve sealing the solid nuclear waste in glass that is in turn encased in 40cm-thick (16in) steel containers. Decisions such as keeping nuclear plants running \"may be unpopular at the moment, but they will pay off\", Merkel was quoted as telling Focus weekly. \"They are necessary for us also in future to be a successful economic centre.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/mar/13/nuclear-turn-away-loss-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"The world's nuclear fate rests in Japan | Julian Glover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/13/nuclear-turn-away-loss-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/13/nuclear-turn-away-loss-japan","fields":{"headline":"The world's nuclear fate rests in Japan","bodyText":"Sometimes stating the obvious is sensible. There are a score of good reasons why Japan's nuclear disaster should not scare the world away from atomic power and a bad one why it will. But bad reasoning can cast out rationality. When nuclear plants go bang on live television – however unrepeatable the causes and controllable the consequences – all the industry's promises about safety and economic logic, and all the arguments for the necessity of building plants to mitigate climate change, are blown away in a scary cloud of caesium dust. It took three decades to undo the emotional consequences of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. It may take something similar to forget the calamity of Fukushima Daiichi. In vain yesterday, Chris Huhne, Britain's anti-turned-pro-nuclear energy secretary, urged us not to panic. Britain doesn't have huge earthquakes, he said. There will be an inquiry. Lessons will be learned. Maybe (he didn't dare add) this will turn out not to be a nuclear disaster at all. Japan's horrendous earthquake has found already so many victims elsewhere. True; but even as Huhne issued his statement engineers were pumping seawater up a pipe from the north Pacific to keep a trio of aged reactors from cooking themselves. This botch job might stop meltdown: but it is not a remedy a garage would recommend for the radiator of an overheating car. When experts decide it is necessary to flood reactors in the world's most technologically advanced nation with an improvised flow of marine muck, people will ask whether the industry's contingency planning for disaster is really as good as we are always being promised. At this point science and sensation drift apart. Nuclear scientists and the industry will try to explain to a doubting public that this incident is not as bad as it seems. Fingers crossed the industry will be right, though what began as a promise of no meltdown, and yesterday came close to controlled meltdown, may end up with assurances that meltdown isn't that bad, just a bit of a glow in the dark. As one glinty-eyed nuclear lobbyist put it: \"Obviously, any time you have an incident at a nuclear plant that involves any damage or explosion, it's not good. But in the scheme of things, is it a disaster? We don't think so.\" To this pantomime fool we must all shout back: oh, yes it is. Disaster comes in many forms, and only one of them involves the irradiation of northern Japan. Another is when a puff of gas blows the lid off your plant and you have to hose it down with the sea. Scientists may be proved right that in the strict sense many things have gone according to contingency plan: that the rest of Japan's 55 nuclear plants behaved perfectly; that even the antiquated Fukushima Daiichi plant – of a design less safe than would be built now – shut down automatically when the earthquake struck and was instead overwhelmed by the tsunami; and that even if the fuel inside the reactor melts through its cladding (unlikely) the main pressure vessel of the reactor should be able to contain the radiation (perhaps). The blast was caused by hydrogen gas. Perhaps the radiation released may prove no more risky than radon seeping daily from Cornish granite. Even if all this turns out to be true, the blow to the industry's credibility will still be immense – \"a turning point for the world\", as Angela Merkel says. A catastrophe in some backward ex-Soviet state might be explained away as the sort of thing that happens in unsophisticated nations with low safety standards. But this was Japan: a land of skill and resilience imbued with a precautionary culture; a land where they'd make every preparation they could. This accident may prove nothing but could signify everything: the illogical fear that the nuclear genie can never be controlled. The loss will be ours. There is an overriding reason to cling on to the development of a dependable, universally available, low-carbon form of generation which can produce massive amounts of power. Without more nuclear plants there is no chance of this country ridding itself of fossil fuels, barring a huge cut in energy consumption which no democratic state will be able to impose. Climate change should still trump the remote prospect of nuclear calamity. Nor are engineers making it up when they say modern designs are better. Most of the waste, and all of the big accidents including this one, have come from early generations of nuclear plants. But like no other contrivance, nuclear power needs the public to trust it because it comes with the possibility of huge invisible destruction. However remote this risk – however small when set against the consequences of burning fossil fuels – it cannot be forgotten. If Fukushima Daiichi proves much worse than it now seems, the west will stop building new nuclear plants. If the incident is contained, we may be able to press on only at the price of loading an industry whose commercial logic is already finely balanced with high safety costs. Either way, this accident may close down the argument. Either way, the planet will feel the pain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/27/future-london-climate-change-images","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-27T17:28:46Z","webTitle":"Images of London after climate change 'are lazy', say refugee groups","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/future-london-climate-change-images","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/27/future-london-climate-change-images","fields":{"headline":"Images of London after climate change 'are lazy', say refugee groups","bodyText":"Wind turbines lining the Mall; a shanty town at the foot of Nelson's column; the Thames frozen under Tower Bridge; and a nuclear power station in Kew gardens. These are some of the artistic visions of a future London loosely inspired by the predictions of climate science. The provocative images are part of the Museum of London's London Futures show, a series of 14 photomotage pictures exploring how the capital might be affected by global warming. They are intended to provoke debate and help people to connect with the implications of climate change, said Antony Robbins, the museum's head of communications. \"I think that many of us still think climate change is something that happens to other people, living thousands of miles from our shores. So I was also really pleased to see the potential this exhibition has for connecting with wider audiences. It even proved popular with the tabloid newspapers, which don't often cover museum stories.\" He said he hoped people would come to the museum to see the images for themselves, so they could decide whether the display \"adds to the climate change debate or simply clouds the issues\". But the pictures have been sharply criticised by groups representing refugees and asylum seekers who say they present a negative image of migrants. Vaughan Jones, the chief executive of Praxis, a London-based charity that provides practical support for displaced people, said: \"Producing sensationalist pictures which fall back on cheap stereotypes of refugees do not help anyone's cause. The issue is too serious for this inaccurate treatment.\" Jonathan Ellis, policy director at the Refugee Council, called them \"lazy and unhelpful\". \"We need fresh and creative messages, and a fair and rational debate based on the facts,\" he said. The digitally manipulated images in the show were created Robert Graves and Didier Madoc-Jones, who work at London-based communications company GMJ. The museum says the photomontages bring \"home the full impact of global warming, food scarcity, rising sea levels and how all Londoners will need to innovate and adapt to survive\". Hannah Smith, refugee project manager for the Climate Outreach and Information Network, said the images were not realistic depictions of climate change's impact on the displacement of people. \"The actual patterns of migration are far more likely to be the movement of people inside existing national borders or, in the case of the UK, from within the European Union. To suggest that there will be mass migration from the [global] south is misleading and feeds xenophobia,\" she said. Graves and Madoc-Jones had not submitted comment at the time of publishing this article. The display runs until 6 March 2011, and the illustrators are giving a talk on their motivations and inspiration behind it on 2 November at the Museum of London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-blast-japan-alert","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-12T11:40:04Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear plant blast puts Japan on high alert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-blast-japan-alert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/12/fukushima-nuclear-blast-japan-alert","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear plant blast puts Japan on high alert","bodyText":"Japan is battling to stave off a nuclear disaster after an explosion at a north-eastern nuclear plant in the wake of the enormous earthquake and tsunami. Authorities are evacuating tens of thousands of residents living within a 12 mile (20km) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi plant and those within 6 miles of a second installation in Futuba, 150 miles north of Tokyo. The explosion followed warnings of a possible meltdown after problems with the cooling system and confirmation of a radiation leak at Fukushima No 1 plant. But nuclear safety officials said it was unlikely the reactor had suffered serious damage, according to the Kyodo news agency. It is feared that 1,300 people died in Friday's double disaster, most being killed as the wall of mud and water engulfed buildings, roads and vehicles, Japanese media reported. But the priority now is to tackle the crisis at the power plant. Kyodo cited an official who said that the rate of hourly radiation leaking from Fukushima was equal to the amount usually permitted in a year. Authorities had previously heralded a successful release of radioactive gases to reduce pressure inside the reactor, which might account for the high levels. \"We are now trying to analyse what is behind the explosion,\" said the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano. \"We ask everyone to take action to secure safety.\" Television footage showed the walls of one building had crumbled, leaving only its metal frame, but it was not clear whether it housed the reactor. The Tokyo Power Electric Company, which runs the Fukushima Daiichi plant, said four workers were injured in the explosion. Hours after the blast, officials widened a 6-mile evacuation zone around the plant and around Fukushima No 2 plant. The Tokyo fire department has dispatched an elite Hyper rescue team to the nuclear plant. An uncontrolled temperature rise at the plant could lead to a meltdown of the uranium reactor core. This could burn through the walls of the vessel and release radiation into a containment building that surrounds the reactor. Some fuel is already thought to have melted in the reactor. Japanese media said officials had detected iodine and caesium, elements released when overheating causes core damage. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said it was urgently seeking information. An explosion of the pressure vessel at the Chernobyl reactor in 1986 led to a vast release of radiation. But experts and authorities urged people to remain calm, suggesting the chances of a major disaster were slight. The crisis began when the 8.9 magnitude earthquake cut out power, turning off the water supply needed to cool the system. The tsunami is thought to have cut off the backup diesel generator an hour later, leading to pressure rising rapidly within the reactor. Earlier in the day a Japanese nuclear safety panel said radiation levels were 1,000 times higher than normal in a control room and eight times higher than normal just outside the plant. Speaking before the blast, Naoto Sekimura, a professor at the University of Tokyo, told the Associated Press a major radioactive disaster was unlikely. \"No Chernobyl is possible at a light water reactor. Loss of coolant means a temperature rise, but it also will stop the reaction,\" he said. \"Even in the worst-case scenario, that would mean some radioactive leakage and equipment damage, but not an explosion. If venting is done carefully, there will be little leakage. Certainly not beyond the 3km radius.\" A partial meltdown in one of the light water reactors at Three Mile Island in 1979 resulted in the release of radioactive gases in the most serious incident in the history of the US nuclear power industry. The reactor was eventually brought under control despite a series of errors. The blast has compounded the fears of survivors in the worst hit region, north-eastern Tohoku, where aftershocks continue to rock the ground. @DavidHalton in Sendai city tweeted: \"Constant sirens and aircraft that I hope are military that on top of worrying about nuclear fallout and tremors.\" Residents woke up after a freezing night on rooftops and in emergency shelters to a sea of mud, water and debris. Earthquakes continued to rock the north-east coast overnight, although some said the worst tremors appeared to be subsiding. Kyodo said rail operators had yet to find four trains after losing contact with them as they operated on coastal lines on Friday. East Japan Railway Company said it did not know how many people were on board the trains. Japan downgraded tsunami warnings in most areas but Tohoku remained on high alert for waves of up to 10 metres high. The tsunami has reached countries across the Pacific region but there were no reports of major damage outside Japan. The country has mobilised 50,000 rescuers, and footage showed some winching people to safety from rooftops. Witnesses said the tsunami had swept inland by up to six miles in Sendai, which has around 1 million inhabitants and is 80 miles from the epicentre. \"The flood came in from behind the store and swept around both sides. Cars were flowing right by,\" said Wakio Fushima, who owns a grocery shop. \"The tsunami was unbelievably fast. Smaller cars were being swept around me and all I could do was sit in my truck,\" said driver Koichi Takairin, who was trapped in his four-tonne vehicle by the torrent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/jul/01/chris-huhne-patter-down-pat","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-01T17:19:52Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne gets patter down pat | Simon Hoggart's sketch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/01/chris-huhne-patter-down-pat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/jul/01/chris-huhne-patter-down-pat","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne gets patter down pat","bodyText":"Chris Huhne ought to have been made minister for housing, as he has an unrivalled knowledge of the problems, owning seven homes of his own.

But he is stuck with being secretary of state for energy. This may be an ironic joke by David Cameron, as Lib Dem and Conservative policies on nuclear power are precisely the opposite of each other. The Tories like nuclear power stations, and the Lib Dems loathe them. So they have settled on the perfect compromise. The coalition government will support new power stations, but none will get built. They have achieved this by declaring that if you are, say, an ordinary businessman or woman who would like to construct a few, you're welcome. But you won't get a penny of public money. Which at least will stop Richard Branson choosing to build any. Would you want to live near a Virgin version of Sellafield? I thought not. The Lib Dems – and they have 22 ministers in the coalition – split into two groups. There are the fastidious ones, often keenly aware that their constituents voted for them on the grounds that they were not Tories. They look awfully unhappy, especially when topics such as VAT increases and cuts in the public sector crop up. Then there are the ones who are keen, who have at last – after all these years – been able to stop pretending to be sandal-wearing, bean-munching, tree-hugging lefties.

Alex Salmond supports plans by the Danish power company Dong to build a major coal-fired station in Ayrshire to replace Hunterston nuclear power plant, claiming it would eventually be fitted with \"clean coal\" carbon-capture technology that will limit its CO2 emissions. But local residents have asked judges in Edinburgh to block a decision by the Scottish government to give the power station special protected status under planning regulations. Environmentalists believe Salmond's ambitious climate change strategies, including a 42% emissions cut target for 2020, and his championing of renewable energy, is undermined by his support for coal. He has called for Longannet coal mine in Fife to reopen, and his government has relaxed planning laws on opencast mines. It emerged last December that the 1.6GW power station, which could open in 2014, had been quietly added to the priority list in the national planning framework (NPF), eight months after the main public consultation on the framework had closed. That status means a planning inquiry cannot challenge the power station's purpose or legitimacy, just its design, siting and any environmental mitigation. Similar measures have been introduced by the UK government in England and Wales. The campaigners, supported by the pressure group Planning Democracy and the Environmental Law Centre Scotland, yesterday submitted a petition for judicial review to the civil Court of Session in Edinburgh, accusing ministers of breaking planning law and European environmental law by failing to properly consult them. The decision to add Hunterston to the NPF list of 14 priority projects was publicised in an obscure official journal, the Edinburgh Gazette, with a six-week consultation period. The main consultation on the 52 projects considered for the framework in 2008 was widely publicised and lasted for three months, supported by workshops. They claim that the government was legally required to use local newspapers in Ayrshire and ensure that residents were fully notified of the proposal. Maggie Kelly, from the residents campaign group Communities Opposed to New Coal at Hunterston (CONCH), said: \"The proposed power station would have a devastating impact on our community, damaging our health, our livelihoods and destroying the local environment. Yet under the National Planning Framework, we have been denied the opportunity to object to this major development.\" The Scottish government refused to discuss the judicial review, but said: \"The public will be able to have their say on matters such as siting, design and the minimisation and mitigation of potential environmental effects as part of the development management process, including any public inquiry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2012/may/25/your-views-on-the-news-academy-schools-marks-and-spencer","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-25T11:42:00Z","webTitle":"Your views on the news - academy schools, starry skies and M&S profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2012/may/25/your-views-on-the-news-academy-schools-marks-and-spencer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2012/may/25/your-views-on-the-news-academy-schools-marks-and-spencer","fields":{"headline":"Your views on the news - academy schools, starry skies and M&S profits","bodyText":"IVF treatment for older women Reports of a new policy which would for the first time allow women aged between 40 and 42 to receive IVF treatment on the NHS divided readers. StevieBee123 writes: If we are to follow the logic of many of the above posters who are against the NHS intervening against the course of nature, then perhaps it would be better if the NHS stopped offering medical treatment altogether. Tumours and viruses and parasitic infections are, after all, perfectly 'natural' phenomena. Alternatively, we could stop viewing the issues concerned in purely economic (and vaguely misogynistic) terms and accept the fact that having and raising children is a uniquely fulfilling proposition and being denied the opportunity through some biological contingency is equally uniquely painful and damaging, and therefore accept that intervening medically to help those who truly want to become parents to do so is overwhelmingly a positive thing. Children shouldn't only be permitted to those who can afford expensive private treatments. I don't really perceive any negative outcome from the decision to extend the upper age limit, and of the comments of those that do, I detect only the petty, unfeeling small-mindedness of the type of person that is pained by anyone other than themselves receiving towards happiness. MFKL says: Rightly or wrongly i cannot help but think 'how ridiculous is this' we are looking at huge cuts across NHS budgets and we want to extend IVF treatments to the \"old' !!!! heightened risks etc etc . As i understannd IVF is expensive with no guaranty of success. Nobody has the 'right' to children, god knows we seem to create more than enough unwanted, neglected ones as it is. Adoption would make more sense - but as usual that's another complicated/nonsensical process which probably ends up as expensive as IVF once all the bureaucrats have had their say RayNoble adds: It should be determined on a case by case basis. There are many reasons why a woman may find herself childless at a later age and there should be room for discretion in the treatment offered. For example, she or her partner may have had ongoing treatment for cancer which now makes it more difficult to conceive. There are ethical issues involved with older women receiving IVF treatment, but again these are often case specific. The argument about adoption is easy to state; but it is not the easy solution suggested. I think where there are clearly clinically-based mitigating circumstances then clinics should be sympathetic. The age guideline of 39 was at best arbitrary and it seems to me a sensible change to lift this to 42. Fairness and reasonableness should always apply in making these decisions. The truth is we live much more socially complicated lives; it is often difficult to establish stable relationships and this is why many come to form families later in life. anniejayoo comments: I didn't meet my husband until I was 40 and starting tr ying to have a family straight away. I could have had a child when I was younger but wanted to wait until I met the right person asI have a strong belief in the family. I know plenty of people in this situation, some who have managed to conceive naturally despite their age and others, like myself, who haven't. We have spent about £30k on IVF so far and are still trying. We weren't eligible for any treatment on the NHS and we accepted that. Where do you draw the line? Many women over 40 don't have success with IVF because of the quality of their eggs and so would need pre-genetic testing, which is expensive and isn't offered on ther NHS at all. So do you keep putting people through it when without this testing it isn't likely to work? Should it be offered only to those who have tried for years and cannot conceive because of physical problems? How do you diferentiate between offering IVF and Gastric band surgery? Breast reduction/augmentation? Dental Implants? NICE are presumably recommending this on the basis that there is no evidence to stop at 39 but this does not have any relevance on the bigger picture - they aren't saying offer this in place of something else so commissioners should prioritise accordingly. Jobseekers to deliver patient care A pilot scheme for jobseekers offering unpaid work placements helping to feed and care for hospital patients is to be extended by Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals trust. Some commenters were concerned that the scheme would threaten existing employees' positions and put patients at risk, while others welcomed the opportunity for jobseekers. From outoftcrookedtimber: This is wrong but also a little misleading. Everything that is being described here, I mean literally everything (\"general tidying, welcoming visitors, serving drinks to patients, running errands, reading to patients and assisting with feeding patients\" as well as the CRB check and health screening) is already being provided for by volunteers in many hospitals up and down the country. My own local hospital has 350 plus of volunteers providing this role (as well as some clerical etc). Also, this kind of work experience is pretty much expected from anyone going into medicine/NHS and so all nursing students, would-be doctors etc. I'm not sure how I feel about this to be honest as it's a worthwhile thing to do but it's not for everyone as placements on medical admissions units, care of elderly wards etc can be pretty taxing even for people desperate to be nurses. Not everyone is cut out to work in wards (many nurses appreciate this) and pushing the unemployed into something like this (even if it's not clinical per se) maybe a pretty unwise thing to do. My cynical head is wondering whether this is to provide lots of people with a basic level of ward skills/feeding in an anticipation of massive boom in private care home provision. stellamaris88 contributes: As a graduate seeking employment I have first hand experience of the fact that in today's job market, it is virtually impossible to get any kind of employment without prior experience. This in turn means it's impossible get the experience required, and so the vicious cycle continues. While this is the situation, unpaid work experience is the best way for individuals to address this problem, and it also gives those of us less gainfully employed a sense of pride and worth. It has the additional benefit of showing drive and initiative, qualities prized by the majority of prospective employers. The above commenters would do well to remember that this is an 8-week placement, not a lifetime of ownership. khamsin says: Can i make a point, from reading this article this is not about nurses, but healthcare assistants, auxiliaries, etc, those who do a lot of the more menial tasks for a lot less than any nurse. This is not a job that requires a lot of training but it is one that requires a caring mentality and at the moment too many people go into because their is no other choice for getting money. There are already too many uncaring carers. I would hope that the government, even one as inempt as this, understands why nurses do 3 year degrees! (you can argue whether a degree is the right method or whether nursing should be a bit more on the job etc.) Academies and SEN News that two academy schools are facing legal challenges for refusing to admit children with statements of special needs prompted some fascinating discussion from readers on SEN provision and the admisssions structure at academies. coolday comments: I have had dealings with a London Academy and a child with special needs - their interpretation of the SSEN requirements was stunning (an extra assistant was in the classroom but never actually provided any assistance to the child that was supposed to receive the assistance! When his SSEN needs changed they failed to re-assess and indeed tried to encourage the mother to remove her child from the school voluntarily (meaning it wouldn't affect their figures), and when she refused tried to move him to an 'educational establishment' that was wholly unsuitable for his needs. They were allowed to get away with it because they didn't come under the LEA requirements. The same school refused to allow its 5th students to go on to their 6th form unless they got a high number of A &amp; B grades at GCSE making the children with a C grade move to an LEA school to study A levels. From cbarr: The point as the article states is not individual cases of needs with many with SEN statements being clearly able to function in mainstream education with moderate adjustments but that academies are not having to go through the same processes with regards special needs children. This raises a number of questions including the provision of support to those children with special needs within accadamies if they don't have the same legal duties. The department of education has to clarify what it is offering funding contracts that disadvantage a proportion of the population with regards access to education in their local communities and whether the contracts themsevlves fall foul of dissability equalities legislation when there are so many laws in this regard with regards the provision of schooling. I'm also supprised no local authority or maintained school has contemplated a case with regards competition in the marketplace and the unfair advantage this gives accadamies if they can save money by reffusing to provide places for special needs children or adequate adjustments. MScott1 adds: I have a daughter with mild cerebral palsy and am worried sick that our local school, soon to be an Academy might use this against her should the school be oversubscribed in her year. I cannot believe how a child with CP could 'compromise' the education of other children - what a truly shocking thing to say. There will be many other children who could compromise the education of others for all sorts of reasons. I hope this goes as high as possible so the parents achieve a positive outcome and this is outed as the scandal that is surely is. Helen121 posts: Gove has centralised the Academies and Free schools, so that they are inside the Department of Education, but outside of the legal framework. And who is monitoring access etc? Are they bound by the FOI acts?, or does Gove only communicate with them by personal email? This really does require investigation and monitoring. What Gove has done is created enormous cracks in the system through which many children can fall. Marks &amp; Spencer's profits drop Users were ready to give their views on reasons for the reported drop in profits at M&amp;S including long-term niggles over bra sizes, ripped clothes and poor customer service. Gumbo posts: M&amp;S are caught in the awkward mid-range space in clothes retailing, where they're not a highly desirable brand which charges high prices and has a high margin business, but they're pricier than Primark, H&amp;M etc. They obviously have a very profitable food business which is in a different space in the market, but it's going to be a long battle to maintain volumes without seeing costs rise exponentially. I actually think they're doing a decent job - for example stuff like suits, shirts etc are pretty good and probably reasonably profitable. The issue they have is trying to attract people below 30 for casual clothes without alienating existing customers. Kyza06 comments: As a 39 year old, M&amp;S still comes top of the list for my wardrobe basics - underwear, t-shirts, summer shorts, officewear - and the food offering is as good or equal to Waitrose IMO, and none of the main chains can beat the 2 eat for £10 deals in quality or ease of cooking. angryeconomist says: looked in my local M&amp;S last month to see if there was anything interesting for blokes clothes (40 year old) and I didn't want to end up looking 60 so gave it a miss. Elasticated waists are not my thing. M&amp;S used to be a by-word for quality and choice - but so many other retailers do this better - Waitrose (food), John Lewis (everything else). I bought some suits the other day and M&amp;S was just not on my radar From 60boy: As I said in a post last Sunday, my wife and I were in the Leamington M&amp;S last Saturday where my wife was looking to buy some summer clothes as she's recently lost a lot of weight. She found numerous things she liked and wished to try on, but none of them was available in her new size of 12! In the end she only bought a pair of jeans in M&amp;S. When she mentioned this to the sales assistant while paying for the jeans, the assistant said they rarely get enough of any women's line in size 12 and what they do get they sell quickly. The only thing she could suggest was trying to order them from another store if possible. In the end we went to House of Fraser for the other things she wanted. Surely it doesn't take much nouse to realize that if size 12 is the most popular size in women's clothes then you order more in that size? Until the management get things like this sorted M&amp;S will continue to lose loyal customers like my wife! islandchick writes: For me it's a few little things that niggle. For example, I won't buy underwear from anywhere else but Marks. Their knickers are brilliant, and always fit well, and I love their bras. However, the t-shirt bras they sell in packs of two, ONLY come in black and white. Why can't I mix and match? I hate white bras, so why can't I just buy two black bras instead of one black and one white? I know it's not the end of the world, but it just irritates me. Kielder forest natural light bid An area of national parkland in Northumberland, including Kielder Forest, could become a \"dark sky preserve\" if the area meets the criteria of the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA). Realcoolchris comments: a couple of years ago, I waslucky enough to visit Mount St John's Observatory at Lake Tekapo in New Zealand. It was a very dark night and the night sky was one of the most wonderful things I've ever seen. It would be fantastic to have a dark skies preserve in the UK. Good luck to them. PeleMcAmble has this to say: I live in rural Northumberland and it's true, at night it is dark up here. I sometimes wonder why we need to have street lights burning all night, the source of much night blight. It seems such a waste with hardly anyone going about and surely it cannot just be to deter burglars. Those satellite photographs taken at night show practically the whole world lit up - what for? Could it be that we need to use the electricity from nuclear power stations that cannot be turned off? Whatever, this sounds like a good initiative and I wish it well. Newtownian1 contributes: Kielder looks good for England but there seem to be better places in Scotland and Spain if you want to make the trek. Also its still only 40 km from Carlisle (pop about 100k), 70 km from Newcastle and 100 km from Glasgow and Ediburgh all of which will prevent total blackout. Another constraint is moisture in the air. It may give sparkling stars at times but this implies lousy viewing. 55DegreesNorth writes: Kielder is one of only two places in Europe where I've experienced genuine darkness &amp; seen the full majesty of the milky way. Through binoculars, it's amazing. I don't think people who haven't been to Northumberland realise just how unpopulated and remote parts of it are. I know the Highlands are way more will, but I've never seen the stars there (whenever I go, if you looked up you would drown). The other place is on top of the mountains in Spain between Tabernas (Almeria) and Baza (Andalucia). Here's a plug. Camp at Las Menas, lie on the road and be astonished. Sexual harassment in public spaces More than four in 10 women were sexually harassed in public spaces in London last year, according to research from YouGov. The survey of 1,047 Londoners prompted readers to share stories of their own experiences and comparisons with other cities. From laleche: If you ask a woman if she has ever been wanked at in a public place, the majority of women will say yes. So if you think about that, it means there are a LOT of men who apparently think that that is acceptable behaviour. People making comments like \"6 out of 10 women not harrassed\" and holding that up as a winning statistic is kind of like hearing about 2 million people being killed in an earthquake and saying \"well it's a country of 10 million so that's not bad\". It is 2012 for fuck's sake - a woman should be able to walk down a street without a high probability of having to listen to some idiot making personal comments about her appearance or worse. yahyah contributes: Sad to hear how much of a problem this still is. Lived in London until I was 33, and when a teenager and young woman travelling on the Tube and working in the West End. That meant almost daily physical assaults on my person, from being made an unwilling participant in someone's masturbatory frottaging on the tube in rush hour, to having my breasts and once even my crotch grabbed while walking down the street. [Amazing just how many tube abusers there were]. It is a most bizarre and horrible experience, just going about your business and someone you weren't even aware of decides that you are a piece of meat to be grabbed, used or propositioned in a foul way. Arguments about men's reptilian brain responses are no excuse. The majority of men act in a decent and respectful way, the ones who don't are just arrogant, sick men with no concept of sexual boundaries. annetan42 adds: It is NOT natural human male behaviour to force your attention on women. Personally I think its a sign of lack of respect for the other half of the human race and also a sign of inadequacy it really doesn't impress us, its not a successful strategy men with any self respect don't do it. There are lots of charming ways to show a women that you appreciate her looks a certain kind of smile can make a girl's day but sleazy comments and even cat calls from a distance (as practised by some building workers) can be intimidating and humiliating especially for young women. I can remember taking a huge detour on my way home from school to avoid the sleazy comments from workers on a building site, it was unwanted and embarrassing. I am nearly 70 now and still remember how it made me feel and believe me it wasn't good. It is of course 'human nature' for men to find women attractive (and vice versa!) but surely in a sane world the attention should make the recipient feel good? Making her feel bad and apparently not caring about her except as an object of lust indicates an appalling attitude to women as people. I still get those nice smiles occasionally btw ;) From weegie: Spare a thought for French women. London is a paradise for women compared to Paris. I was a harassed there several times a day, pretty much every day. I walked with my eyes down, stopped wearing skirts, never drank a coffee alone, or only at the counter and downed in 2 or 3 gulps, I sat next to women when I could on the metro, I got a taxi even if it was walking distance at night - I even got approached in a church (twice). The women here just endure this. I told a guy to fuck off once in a supermarket (after staring at my chest and licking his lips) and he exploded and had to be removed by the security guard. In Britain I always got the impression that men fell into two categories the 'get yer tits out for the lads' type who operate in groups, and the 'nice' guy that who spends so much time nervously assessing his chances that every opportunity passes him by. Attention is pleasant when it is respectful and polite (smile, glances) but nobody wants their body assessed, ogled or commented on by complete strangers. Oscaria comments: I was on the London Underground on a school trip when I was seventeen, which was two years ago. It was extremely crowded and our class and teachers were with us. I was standing next to the door with my case, when this man started feeling my arse. I thought he was trying to reach something, but he just stood there squeezing it. I was absolutely terrified as no one else saw, but he got off at the next stop and ran off. Within an hour of arriving in London last year, a man in a white van wolf-whistled at me on a crowded street as he passed by. It was humiliating. Thanks for all your comments this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/12/japan-radiation-minamisoma","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-12T17:37:37Z","webTitle":"Japan radiation fears grip town on edge of destruction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-radiation-minamisoma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-radiation-minamisoma","fields":{"headline":"Japan radiation fears grip town on edge of destruction","bodyText":"The debris strewn along the coastal neighbourhoods of Minamisoma should be proof enough of the devastation wrought by the tsunami that hit Japan's north-east coast on 11 March. But for the past month this sprawling town in Fukushima prefecture has been confronted by a second, more insidious threat: radiation. Minamisoma is a town living in a state of nuclear limbo. Its southern reaches lie just inside the 20km (12 mile) radius from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that has been declared an evacuation zone. Farther north, residents have been told to remain indoors or consider leaving. Thenon Tuesday the government announced that five additional communities, possibly including more neighbourhoods inside Minamisoma, are to be included in an expanded evacuation zone amid fears over the long-term effects of radiation seeping from the Fukushima plant. Even before that advice was issued, the majority of Minamisoma's 71,000 people had voted with their feet. The first hydrogen explosion at the plant prompted an exodus that saw the population plummet to just 10,000. Petrified residents barely had time to mourn the 1,470 local people listed as dead or missing before abandoning their homes. Shops and restaurants closed, suppliers refused to enter the town, and for a few chaotic days the only vehicles on the streets were self-defence force trucks and dozens of buses laid on to take evacuees to hundreds of temporary shelters across Japan. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the crisis had not caused any direct damage to the health of people living near the plant. \"The accident itself is very serious, but we have set our priorities so as to avoid damage to people's health.\" His claim is backed by a recent radiation reading in Minamisoma that measured 0.9 microsieverts per hour - or 7,884 microsieverts per year - which is little more than that received in a chest CT scan and, say experts, poses no immediate threat to health. But the new evacuation plans have added a layer of uncertainty to a community already gripped by fear. Some residents who initially evacuated are now returning to the area, reassured by data showing that radiation is well below dangerous levels. At a local health centre medical workers in protective clothing offer free radiation checks for residents and visitors. \"People here are already traumatised by memories of the tsunami and the struggle to survive the nuclear crisis,\" said Kyohei Takahashi, a gynaecologist who initially left Minamisoma but returned a few days later. He came back to find patients deprived of essential care and hospitals emptied of staff. \"At the start we had no food or medicine – we couldn't even administer intravenous drips,\" said Takahashi, 72. \"At first the streets were dead. But now there are a few cars on the road and some shops have reopened. Radiation levels are very low, but people are still anxious about the future. \"It could be months before things settle down. Until then, all I can do is my job. If we all work together we can make something of this town, even if it takes years. But it will never be the same again.\" The emergency at Fukushima Daiichi, now rated on a par with the Chernobyl disaster in its severity, has split the community he serves. Yoshitaka Okawa, who has worked for a subcontractor at the plant for 19 years, is one of the few residents who have remained in the city throughout the crisis. He loses sleep not over radiation, but over the friendships that he fears may have been irreparably damaged by his pleas to neighbours not to abandon the town of his birth. \"I've been working at Fukushima Daiichi for almost two decades. I know all about millisieverts and microsieverts [of radiation], and I have never considered leaving,\" says the 60-year-old, an employee of a firm that decontaminates nuclear plant workers. Okawa has not been back to the plant since 11 March, when he fled the No 5 reactor building following the 9.0-magnitude earthquake. \"I'm due to retire, so I won't be going back. As things are, I couldn't even if I wanted to. \"But other people in the town don't think rationally. When the media report that radiation is several thousand times above legal limits, they panic. \"The people I feel sorry for are farmers whose lives have been ruined by radiation scares, and the old people who have been unable to leave. When I see people in Tokyo panic-buying water or choosing not to buy certain produce, I wonder if they have any feelings for fellow Japanese who are genuinely in need of help.\" Minamisoma's plight drew worldwide attention last week after its mayor, Katsunobu Sakurai, pleaded for help in an 11-minute YouTube video with English subtitles. \"We are left isolated,\" said a clearly exhausted Sakurai, dressed in his familiar crisis uniform. \"I beg you, as the mayor of Minamisoma, to help us.\" The town's commercial infrastructure, he said, lies in tatters. \"The only places open are local banks and credit unions,\" he said in an interview with the Mainichi Daily News. \"The supermarkets are still not running. There are no daily supplies that people living here desperately need. \"If the city doesn't maintain its essential services, evacuated residents won't know which way to turn. The government must do all it can to address the nuclear accident and give us an idea of when it will be resolved.\" But as Japan's prime minister Naoto Kan has acknowledged, it is a question to which no one knows the answer. And for all his optimism over the radiation threat, Okawa concedes that the unease it has generated has changed Minamisoma beyond recognition. \"As long as the power plant is in trouble, this town might as well be dead. You walk to the station and everything is shuttered. At night the streets are dark and empty. This used to be a fun, lively place to live. But not any more.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/31/consumption-of-goods-falling","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-31T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Why is our consumption falling?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/31/consumption-of-goods-falling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/31/consumption-of-goods-falling","fields":{"headline":"Why is our consumption falling?","bodyText":"The year 2001 was more eventful than most and, a decade on, we're inundated with anniversaries. September was 9/11, this month the invasion of Afghanistan and next month the release of the first iPod. To which we could add the foot-and-mouth crisis, the Gujarat earthquake and the first ever entries on Wikipedia. With so many significant events to look back on, one thing that few people will remember 2001 for is its entry in the UK's Material Flow Accounts, a set of dry and largely ignored data published annually by the Office for National Statistics. But, according to environment writer Chris Goodall, those stats tell an important story. \"What the figures suggest,\" Goodall says enthusiastically, \"is that 2001 may turn out to be the year that the UK's consumption of 'stuff' – the total weight of everything we use, from food and fuel to flat-pack furniture – reached its peak and began to decline.\" Quietly spoken but fiercely intelligent, Goodall is a consultant and author who, over the last decade or so, has established himself as a leading analyst on energy and climate issues. Probably the only Green Party parliamentary candidate who also used to work at McKinsey, his speciality is trawling through environment statistics that would send traditional eco-warriors to sleep. \"One thing that's remarkable is the sheer speed with which our resource use has crashed since the recession,\" Goodall continues. \"In the space of a couple of years, we've dropped back to the second lowest level since we started keeping track in 1970. And although the figures aren't yet available for 2010 and 2011, it seems highly likely that we are now using fewer materials than at any time on record.\" Goodall discovered the Material Flow Accounts while writing a research paper examining the UK's consumption of resources. The pattern he stumbled upon caught him by surprise: time and time again, Brits seemed to be consuming fewer resources and producing less waste. What really surprised him was that consumption appears to have started dropping in the first years of the new millennium, when the economy was still rapidly growing. In 2001, Goodall says, the UK's consumption of paper and cardboard finally started to decline. This was followed, in 2002, by a fall in our use of primary energy: the raw heat and power generated by all fossil fuels and other energy sources. The following year, 2003, saw the start of a decline in the amount of household waste (including recycling) generated by each person in the country – a downward trend that before long could also be observed in the commercial and construction waste sectors. In 2004, our purchases of new cars started to fall – as did our consumption of water. The next year, 2005, saw our household energy consumption starting to slump (notwithstanding an uptick last year due to the cold winter). And in 2006 we seem to have got bored with roads and railways, with a decline in the average distance travelled on private and public transport. All of this while GDP – and population – went up. Other consumption categories have been falling for much longer, Goodall points out. Despite concerns about the increasing intensity and industrialisation of our farming, the amount of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilisers being applied to British fields has been falling since the 1980s. Our consumption of cement reached a peak at a similar time. Even our intake of food is falling. Although obesity is on the rise, the total number of calories consumed by Brits has been on a downward slope for around half a century, driven by the fact that, compared with previous generations, we do less exercise now and live in warmer homes. Perhaps more remarkably, our intake of meat – the food most regularly highlighted as an environmental concern – seems to have been falling since 2003. Goodall's research sends a counterintuitive message. We might expect to have been getting through less stuff since the financial crash of 2008; but surely throughout the boom years of 1990s and noughties, our rate of material consumption was steadily climbing in step with GDP? Not according to Goodall. But do his claims stack up? One obvious counter-argument is the fact that we have \"outsourced\" our resource-hungry industries to China and other developing countries. After all, various reports have already made it clear that while the UK's own use of oil, coal and gas is falling, our total carbon emissions, once you consider all Chinese factories producing our laptops, toys and clothes, continues to rise steadily. Oddly, though, when it comes to overall resource use – everything from maize to metals – the same doesn't seem to apply. At least, not if we believe the official figures from the Office of National Statistics. Each year, statisticians there estimate the UK's Total Material Requirement, the grand total of all the goods we consume, plus all the materials used in the UK and overseas to produce those goods. The numbers are head-spinningly huge. Once you add up minerals, fuels, crops, wood and animal products, the UK churns its way through roughly two billion tonnes of stuff each year. That's more than 30 tonnes for each man, woman and child in the country – a giant stack of raw materials as heavy as four double-decker buses. (Or, more specifically, as heavy as four old- fashioned Routemaster buses. In an exception to Goodall's theory, some of the newer, more efficient buses are almost twice as heavy as the old ones.) Although that's still a massive – and doubtless unsustainable – rate of consumption, Goodall's point is that our appetite for materials may finally be on a downward curve. In particular, he's excited by the fact that over the past couple of decades, we've significantly grown the economy without noticeably increasing our resource use. To use the jargon, Goodall believes that Britain has finally \"decoupled\" economic growth and material consumption. If correct, this means we've achieved something that many green commentators believed was impossible. In his influential 2009 book, Prosperity Without Growth, academic Tim Jackson argued that while economies could become more efficient in their use of resources, genuine decoupling – resource use falling while GDP rises – remained a \"myth\". This view, and the argument that we therefore should aim for zero-growth economics, has become widely accepted in environment circles. Goodall believes that the data from the Office of National Statistics, combined with his own research, challenges this assumption. \"In 2007, just before the crash,\" Goodall says, \"our total use of materials was almost the same as it was in 1989, despite the economy having tripled in size in the intervening years. And the peak in resource use appears to have been in 2001 – many years before the recession halted economic growth.\" Jackson welcomed Goodall's research, describing it as \"long overdue\" and \"exactly the kind of analysis that is sadly lacking at policy level and desperately needed as the basis for a green economy\". But he also warned against drawing simple conclusions, pointing out that – thanks to Britain's investments in the global commodity markets – our economy was continuing to increase resource use even if we had started consuming fewer of those resources ourselves. \"For those hoping desperately for stuff-free growth,\" Jackson added, \"there is only cold comfort in these statistics.\" Andrew Simms of the New Economics Foundation also doubts the significance of the UK reaching peak stuff. \"Measures of our environmental impact are only meaningful when they're related to the planet's ability to keep up. For these findings to be significant, we'd need to be able to demonstrate that we're on the way to being able to live within our ecological means. And on that measure we're still a long way off target.\" Jackson and Simms are certainly right that – even if the UK has started consuming fewer resources – it's hardly going to save the planet. Globally, resource extraction is rising, carbon emissions are climbing, rainforests are shrinking, oceans are acidifying and species are disappearing. Solving these problems will clearly take far more than stabilising resource use in mature economies like the UK. Goodall acknowledges this. \"I don't want to suggest for a moment that the world doesn't face massive environmental challenges. But the data I found does suggest the possibility – and it is only a possibility – that economic growth is not necessarily incompatible with addressing these challenges. If growth helps us get more efficient in our use of resources, and actually reduces our consumption of material things, then environmentalists may be very wrong to campaign for a zero-growth economy.\" Bringing the debate back to earth, he adds: \"It is a trivial example but economic growth, and the innovation that comes with it, have given us the Kindle, a way of allowing us to read books without the high-energy consumption required to make paper. Digital goods generally have lower environmental impact than physical equivalents and if growth speeds up the process of 'dematerialisation', it has positive – not negative – environmental effects.\" The idea that the best way to get greener may be to get richer isn't a new one. Economist Simon Kuznets argued decades ago that only when countries get to a certain level of wealth do they start to reduce their environmental impact. In green circles, however, such thinking is controversial. While environmentalists accept that poor countries need to grow economically to lift themselves out of poverty, most are thoroughly sceptical that conventional growth-focused economics is compatible with saving the planet from impending disaster. There is, however, an emerging pro-growth seam of environmental thinking. Earlier this year, writer Mark Lynas caused a stir with his book The God Species, in which he broke a trio of green taboos by calling for environmentalists to embrace GM foods, nuclear power and growth-based capitalism. GM food would allow us to leave more of the world as wilderness, Lynas wrote; nuclear energy would help us wean ourselves off coal; and climbing economic growth would give us the best chance of combatting global poverty and funding the technical revolution required to green our production of energy and goods. Simms says that to call for economic growth as the solution to the planet's woes is to miss the point. \"The important question is this: is your economy doing something useful, and doing it within environmental boundaries? If we want to create a happy, low-carbon world, there are better ways to do that than slavishly trying to enlarge our economies. Bear in mind that 50 years of GDP growth and increasing resource use in the UK has done nothing to increase our life satisfaction.\" Ecological and economic arguments aside, Goodall's suggestion that the UK may have reached the point of maximum resource use throws up lots of interesting questions. Most fundamentally: is it definitely true? How can we be sure that consumption won't soar to new, even greater, highs when the global economy eventually picks up? And if we really have reached a peak, how did we get there? Was it just a matter of shifting to a more service-based economy? Can the internet – or even decades of green campaigning – claim the credit? Or could it be that our densely packed little island is running out of space for new buildings, vehicles and bulky goods? Could eBay and Freecycle be a factor, helping to keep more goods in circulation for longer? Or the fact that more of us are living in cities? If we can understand how we levelled off British resource use, perhaps that information could help other countries do the same. After all, in a world that may soon be home to nine billion people, there can be fewer more important messages than – when it comes to \"stuff\" – less can be more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/mar/22/budget-2011-george-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-22T22:30:03Z","webTitle":"George Osborne plans budget boost for homebuyers and drivers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/22/budget-2011-george-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/mar/22/budget-2011-george-osborne","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne plans budget boost for homebuyers and drivers","bodyText":"George Osborne will seek to appeal to Britain's \"squeezed middle\" when he announces help for first-time buyers, motorists and 25 million income tax payers in a budget designed to tighten the Treasury's grip over public spending. Despite disappointing news for the public finances, the chancellor is expected to say that he has scope to raise the income tax personal allowance by £600 next year, fund a £250m shared equity scheme for new homes and defer the above-inflation increase in petrol duty due next month. But Osborne will balance tax giveaways with fresh tax-raising measures, a crackdown on tax avoidance and \"special measures\" for overspending Whitehall departments in what sources insisted would be a \"steady-as-she-goes\" package. The chancellor will outline a range of measures – including a shake-up of planning laws, deregulation of employment laws affecting small businesses, and the long-awaited plans for a green investment bank as the coalition government seeks to shift the focus of the economy from deficit reduction to boosting growth. Osborne will admit that the UK's growth prospects for 2011 have worsened since last autumn, with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility likely to pencil in an increase of around 1.8% in gross domestic product this year against the 2.1% it forecast last November. But the chancellor will signal his determination not to let the government's deficit reduction plans slip, with fresh controls designed to intensify pressure on ministers to rein in spending. Departments that fail to manage their budgets properly will be placed in special measures – akin to the Ofsted rating given to a failing school – with tough penalties. These could include fines for overspending or being forced to seek Treasury authorisation for larger spending decisions. City hopes that public borrowing for 2010-11 would come in £10bn below the £148bn forecast received a dent with news that the deficit in February topped £10bn – the highest for the month since modern records began in 1993. Meanwhile, inflation according to the consumer price index rose from 4% to a 28-month high of 4.4% last month, pushing up government spending on state benefits. Dearer food, fuel and clothing were the main factors behind last month's jump in inflation, which is now more than double the government's 2% target. The increase in the CPI measure of inflation was matched by a rise in the alternative yardstick of the cost of living, the retail prices index, which rose from 5.1% to 5.5% last month, its highest for 20 years. In a move that will please the Liberal Democrat wing of the coalition, Osborne will say that the income tax personal allowance, due to go up to £7,475 next month, will be raised by more than inflation from next year. The increase of around £600 – which comes on top of the £1,000 rise next month – will be worth an average of £45 a year for taxpayers earning up to £115,000 a year. The 550,000 taxpayers who earn more than £115,000 will lose £45 a year because they no longer have a personal allowance. Osborne will announce a joint scheme with the construction industry to help some of the potential first-time buyers currently frozen out of the housing market. First-time buyers with a household income of less than £60,000 a year who can put down a 5% deposit on a new home will be eligible for an equity loan worth up to 20% of the value of the property jointly funded by the government and housebuilders. The loan will be interest-free for five years and only be repayable when the house is sold. With most first-time buyers only able to secure mortgages worth 75% of a property's value, Osborne is expected to say his scheme will give some young people the chance to meet the exacting loan standards demanded by lenders in the wake of the financial crisis, lead to the building of 10,000 new homes and protect 40,000 jobs in the construction industry. The year long cabinet battle over Britain's ability to invest in the next generation of green infrastructure will be resolved when a green investment bank is established with access to up to £3bn of funds, and an ability to borrow from April 2015. Green groups will be disappointed about the deferral of borrowing powers, but pleased at the higher than expected interim funding. The battle over the bank was resolved on Sunday and the outcome reflects a wider political struggle to ensure plans in the budget to ease pressure on the squeezed middle, including freezing planned fuel duty rises, does not strip the coalition of its green credentials. Ministers admit the deferral of the bank's borrowing powers to 2015-16 reflects Treasury determination to ensure net debt as a percentage of GDP is falling by 2015-16. But they also argue that decisions on the next big wave of green investment projects, including offshore wind farms, do not need to be made until after 2015. In a negotiating success for Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, the bank will be given access to £1bn of funds from 2012-13, as opposed to the earlier plan to wait until 2013-4. The bank will also be given access from 2012-13 to £775m from the asset sales from HS1, the superfast rail track between London and the Channel tunnel. In addition the bank will have access to £1bn from the sales from 2013-14 from Urenco, the company that makes enriched uranium from nuclear power. The government owns a third of Urenco jointly with the Dutch government and German energy companies RWE and E.On. The Treasury has given a guarantee that if the income from the sale of Urenco is not forthcoming, the green bank will have access to other funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/aug/24/cracks-iranian-regime-sanctions-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-24T12:12:21Z","webTitle":"The cracks in the Iranian regime | Massoumeh Torfeh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/24/cracks-iranian-regime-sanctions-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/24/cracks-iranian-regime-sanctions-iran","fields":{"headline":"The cracks in the Iranian regime","bodyText":"Looking at the Iranian press over the past few weeks you would be forgiven for thinking that Iran is in a state of hypertension. The long list of new military hardware ready to fire against the \"enemy\" is mindboggling. While punitive sanctions are taking effect, Iran continues to face the threat of a military strike from Israel. At the same time the US refuses to remove from the table the possibility of military action. The inauguration of the Bushehr nuclear power plant on Saturday – described by Israel as \"totally unacceptable\" – seems to have made matters even worse. On Monday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards naval force commander, Ali Fadavi, announced the production of two new high-speed boats with missile launchers. He said Iran had \"reached unparalleled power\" in cruise missile defence. These are new versions of Zolfaqar and Seraj 1 rocket launchers. They are \"unrivalled\" in high speed, according to Iran's defence minister, Ahmad Vahidi. He warned the \"enemies\" of Iran that they are \"playing with fire\". On Sunday, Iran unveiled its homemade, unmanned, long-distance bomber drone, described by the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as \"an ambassador of death\" to Tehran's enemies. On Saturday, while the world was watching the opening of Bushehr nuclear power plant, Iranian TV was repeatedly showing the latest surface-to-surface missile, Qiam1, which follow Sajil and Shahab. Meanwhile Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has stressed on \"keeping unity\" among the ruling clique. He warned in a speech last Thursday against \"intentional\" opposition to government, especially from \"high office\". They should \"confess and repent\" in the holy month of Ramadan. The internal feud between the \"pragmatist\" right – led by the speaker of parliament, Ali Larijani, and the hardline president, Ahmadinejad, has not been a well-kept secret. Larijani has blocked several of Ahmadinejad's policy proposals and Ahmadinejad has in turn refused to implement those that the parliament ratified. Larijani then had to intervene and order the executive branch to implement what parliament had ratified. And his brother, Sadeq Larijani, who is the head of judiciary, has openly criticised Ahmadinejad's interference in the work of the judiciary and for his lack of \"appropriate political language\" in internal and international affairs. In turn, Ahmadinejad supporters such as the rightwing member of parliament, Fatemeh Alia, criticised the judiciary for encouraging attacks on Ahmadinejad. The opposition to Ahmadinejad is also supported by a leading member of parliament, Ahmad Tavakoli, and by Mohsen Rezai, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as well as by Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf, Tehran's mayor. There are also two other potent opponents, both sons of respected ayatollahs: Ali Motahari and Hassan Khomeini. The same group have also been actively pursuing the president's chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim-Mashai. Yet, Ahmadinejad has just given him an added portfolio as the president's special representative for the Middle East. He is regarded as the president's protege for the next presidential elections. The constitution bars Ahmadinejad from a third term. Instead he has been nurturing support in a group called the Sweet Scent of Service. So, the infighting among the ruling clique has been persistent and serious. The official conservative media has given it coverage since the powerbrokers have their own mafia-like groups inside the media. The Fars news agency, close to the IRGC, quotes Ahmad Karimi-Esfahani, the head of the powerful bazaar merchants' guild, apparently criticising Ahmadinejad for his \"non-diplomatic\" language, which is \"provocative\" and leads to international sanctions. If our leaders did not quarrel so much, says Esfahani, \"the west would not be able to use internal problems as justification for sanctions\". Insecurity about the punitive sanctions has clearly aggravated the tension at the top. \"Under the threat of sanctions,\" Iran's supreme leader warned, \"no one must speak in a way that implies tension between the parliament, the judiciary and the government.\" Another effect of sanctions seems to have been an official rapprochement towards the United States. We know that Ahmadinejad and the foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, have recently repeatedly spoken of their willingness to talk. However, far more important was the clearest green light given by the supreme leader, Khamenei. In a somewhat unnoticed part of his speech last Thursday he said: \"Speaking to the US under conditions of threat and pressure cannot be regarded as talks. We are happy to hold talks but not with a US that wants talks under sanctions, threats and pressure. We are ready for talks if they [the US] could climb down from their superpower ladder and stop sanctions and threats.\" Under these changing circumstances two steps could be regarded as immature: first, if the US fell for the ploy and began talks before sanctions took full effect, and second, if there was a decision by Israel or the US to strike Iran's nuclear sites. Both would play into the hands of the hardliners. The most prudent response could be to continue with the present policy while ensuring close scrutiny of the nuclear sites by the IAEA."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2011/mar/22/france-science-nuclear-neutrino-lehir","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-22T13:59:01Z","webTitle":"Tracking down the crafty neutrino","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/mar/22/france-science-nuclear-neutrino-lehir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2011/mar/22/france-science-nuclear-neutrino-lehir","fields":{"headline":"Tracking down the crafty neutrino","bodyText":"In the Ardennes hills near Givet, in eastern France, stands Chooz nuclear power station, with its twin concrete cooling towers spewing steam. Here scientists may soon catch some neutrinos and break one of the most enigmatic secrets of the universe. Chooz is best known for its two 1,450 MW nuclear reactors, commissioned in the late 90s. They are precursors of the second-most recent generation of French reactors. But there is also an international laboratory, which pools 35 research teams from eight countries. They are hosted by the French Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the Atomic and Alternative Energies Commission (CEA). The scientists have installed an ultra-sophisticated neutrino detector in a cavern under a layer of rock 150 metres thick, which acts as a screen against cosmic rays. The detector rests at the bottom of a pit seven metres deep and as many wide. It is very difficult to catch neutrinos, despite the fact that they are the commonest elementary particles in the universe. They may even have served as building blocks for all the matter that surrounds us. But they are nevertheless almost undetectable: in just one second several tens of billions of neutrinos pass through every square centimetre of our bodies without us ever noticing. As their name – \"little neutral one\" in Italian– suggests, they are electrically neutral. No magnetic field diverts them from their course, shooting straight ahead at almost the speed of light. Above all, having nearly zero mass, they very rarely encounter any obstacles. Almost nothing stops them. Only if they happen to collide with an atom does a flash of energy reveal their passing. The physicists in the cave at Chooz are on the lookout for collisions of this sort, or more exactly a possible lack of collisions. \"There are many sources of neutrinos in nature,\" says Thierry Lasserre, the head of the experiment at CEA. \"The cosmos, the sun, exploding stars and active galaxy cores all produce vast quantities of them. Nuclear reactors also release enormous amounts of electron neutrinos … or more exactly antineutrinos, with properties and characteristics considered to be identical.\" The two reactors at Chooz each produce 1026 antineutrinos a day, which hare off in all directions. Given the detector's volume (10 cubic metres) and its distance from the source (1km), about 1021 of these particles pass through it every day. According to probability calculations, only 70 of them should actually hit the detector. Odd as it may seem, the physicists are hoping there will be fewer hits than predicted, as this would mean that on their way some antineutrinos have morphed, enabling them to slip through the net. Neutrinos are remarkably tricky customers. There are three types or flavours: electron, muon and tau neutrinos, named after three other particles to which they give rise when they collide with an atom. The flavours correspond to the three families of elementary particle. \"To produce all ordinary matter, just one of these families would suffice. So why did nature create three families? It is one of the great mysteries of physics,\" says Hervé de Kerret, the CNRS project leader. To complicate matters further, the various types of neutrino do not occur in isolation. As they propagate through space they may oscillate between the three available flavours, shifting from one particle family to another. This gift for transformation has already been measured for two forms of mixture: the third has yet to be assessed. This is the goal set for the Double Chooz experiment. It will seek to determine how many electron antineutrinos, out of the 70 predicted, fail to show, indicating that they have morphed in transit. To be absolutely certain, the instrument, currently being calibrated, will be duplicated. Between now and 2012 a second detector will be installed only 400 metres from the two reactors, its role being to gauge the initial stream of particles very precisely. If this can be achieved, it should lead to a leap in our understanding of these intriguing particles. Costing $21m and tipped to beat similar projects in China and in South Korea, Double Chooz will operate for five years, in order to collate sufficient data. Designing and installing the dual system has been a huge undertaking, requiring amazing attention to detail, says Patrick Perrin, the CEA operations manager. \"The detectors,\" he explains, \"are like Russian nesting dolls, with a series of superimposed containments, filled with a glittering liquid: mineral oil enriched with the heavy metal gadolinium. When a neutrino collides with a hydrogen nucleus it produces two flashes of purple light, which in turn are converted into electrical signals by 400 photo-sensitive detectors.\" The scientists can barely contain their excitement. \"The standard model of [particle] physics describes the structure of the universe with 12 elementary particles and four force carriers. But this involves too many parameters,\" De Kerret and Lasserre explain. \"We need to invent a different model, simpler yet more comprehensive.\" In particular, the standard model does not explain the mass of neutrinos and their oscillation, so it needs to be amended. But that is not all. Neutrinos could clarify another mystery. In theory the Big Bang created equal quantities of matter and antimatter, but (fortunately) matter has become predominant in the universe. Just after the original bang, neutrinos may have disintegrated into particles of matter and antimatter, but with very slight asymmetry in favour of matter. If Double Chooz discovers such asymmetry in the behaviour of its neutrinos and antineutrinos, it would support this hypothesis.

But the suggestion that EDF Energy was engaged in \"behind-the scenes lobbying\" to gain a \"hidden subsidy\" is wrong. We were responding to an open pre-consultation by government. This invited views from all parties, including ourselves and NGOs, on the price for radioactive waste disposal. We work hard to be part of the debate and recently set out our commitment to transparency. We have always been open that we expect to pay the full costs of decommissioning and our full share of the waste management and disposal costs from our new-build programme. You report that there will be \"further scrutiny on the government's promise that there will be no subsidy for nuclear power\". But we have not asked for subsidy for new nuclear in the UK. We believe it can be delivered without subsidy, in line with the coalition government agreement. However, no electricity generator – of nuclear, wind or other source – can invest without a robust policy framework. As your article suggests, central to this is the mechanism to make sure nuclear liabilities from new-build will be met. We need to avoid past mistakes and put in place a funding mechanism to make sure enough money is set aside by the operator during the generating lifetime of the plant to cover liabilities. These funds should be ringfenced so they can be used only for this purpose and so the taxpayer is protected from picking up the bill. This way, there will be funds available to cover the liabilities when ownership of the waste passes to government, which we believe should happen after decommissioning. The financial and legal arrangements to achieve this are complex, and will need ongoing dialogue between government, industry, NGOs and others. One important element is the government's proposal to set a fixed price for waste disposal. This would carry a premium to protect taxpayers against the risk that future costs could be higher than anticipated. We agree with these principles. You report that \"last year the government proposed charging a very high fixed unit price for waste disposal\". In our submission we argued that the fixed price can be set more accurately once these disposal plans are more developed. Britain's waste disposal strategy, like others globally, is via a geological repository. The government is working on the location, design and cost of this. As you report, \"the consultation is continuing\". We recognise the need for ongoing debate. Last week we launched our sustainability commitments, one of the largest such initiatives from any UK company. These include measurable pledges on how we will responsibly deliver low-carbon nuclear power. Foremost is a commitment to be open and transparent in our nuclear business, and to demonstrate that we can be trusted. We expect the government and the public to hold us to these promises."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/jan/27/england-10-important-wildlife-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-27T11:27:03Z","webTitle":"England's 10 most important wildlife sites revealed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/27/england-10-important-wildlife-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jan/27/england-10-important-wildlife-sites","fields":{"headline":"England's 10 most important wildlife sites revealed","bodyText":"Sandy dunes on a north-east island and a damp square-metre patch in a picturesque dale are revealed today to be among the 10 most important wildlife sites in England, providing the last refuges for some of our rarest species. Fragile flora and fauna such as the brightly marked ladybird spider and endearing pool frog are clinging to survival in tiny pockets of the UK in habitats ranging from royal parks to ancient fenland. The Derbyshire feather-moss, a green aquatic growth just one metre square at a secret location in Cressbrook Dale in the county, exists nowhere else in the world. The significance of the sites is disclosed by Natural England, the conservation body. All are designated sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) as efforts continue to ensure such species do not become globally extinct. Success stories include the ladybird spider, the most elusive arachnid in Britain, which derives its name from the male's red markings during the mating season, and which can be found in only one undisclosed location in Dorset. In 1994, its numbers slumped to just 56, but following habitat management, a recent web count now indicates a population of around 1,000. The pool frog survived for thousands of years in ancient fens, only to die out in the wild in the 1990s, with the sole survivor finally expiring in captivity in 1999. Still England's rarest amphibian, it was reintroduced to Norfolk from Sweden in 2005 and there is now a breeding colony at a secret site in the county after a programme of targeted habitat restoration. The queen's executioner beetle – Megapenthes lugens – did not even have a common name until a competition run by the Guardian with Natural England last year. Found on decayed beech and elm trees in the former royal hunting ground of Windsor Forest and Great Park, the large, nocturnal beetle is believed to feed on the larvae of other beetles as well as flowers, and makes a distinctive clicking sounds as it escapes from predators. Meanwhile, coastal dunes on Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, provide ideal conditions for the Lindisfarne helleborine, a wild orchid which can grow to 2ft tall, and of which there are just 300 plants. The 10 SSSIs are among 4,119 across England at which farmers, land managers, volunteers, charities and public bodies such as the Ministry of Defence have contributed to the battle to protect such rarities. Natural England said about 96.5% of the sites are now classified as in favourable condition, compared with just 57% in 2003. One of the biggest single factors for the turnaround is environmental stewardship grants given to farmers to protect threatened habitats. Helen Phillips, Natural England's chief executive, said: \"SSSIs are often all that stand between some of our most threatened species and extinction. By providing essential habitat that may not be found elsewhere, they represent a life support system whose importance cannot be overstated. It's important that we celebrate these last refuges and the species they sustain, so that we can ensure they receive the attention and support they need.\" As a result, the Sussex emerald moth, first recorded at Beachy Head in 1902, still has a toehold in Britain in the shadow of the Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent, and the less remarkable looking but even more uncommon reddish buff moth survives on a single site on the Isle of Wight. The Teesdale rock-rose and Teesdale sandwort have existed in isolation since the last ice age in the Durham Dales. Avon Gorge is home to two species of tree – the Bristol and Wilmott's whitebeam – found nowhere else on the planet. Even an unprepossessing drain at Delph Bridge in Cambridgshire attracts botanists, sustained by a nearby burger van. They visit to admire the previously lost fen ragwort, which was extinct for a century but burst back into life in the 1960s when the ditch was dug and dormant seeds exposed in the peat. Richard Benyon, minister for the natural environment, said the sites provided \"safe havens for some of England's rarest wildlife that might not survive elsewhere\" and the government would continue to work with land managers and Natural England to build on recent success. • This article and its headline have been amended. The original article and headline stated that these were \"Britain's 10 most important wildlife sites\", when the report by Natural England only concerns SSSIs in England.

Under John Major in the 1990s, Gallie was one of the few Scottish Tory MPs who were beyond the pale of ministerial office. Indeed, he helped personify the Scottish party's near-fatal inability to find publicly recognisable figures to succeed the old patrician class who were not outright populists with views which reinforced the Thatcherite caricature. Gallie could always be relied on to fight the Tory corner in Scotland, however unpopular the cause. As their public representatives declined in numbers, he became an ever-more familiar presence on radio phone-ins and panel discussions. His style was combative and dismissive of anything he regarded as fashionably left-wing. Nobody doubted the sincerity of his convictions. In 1992 Gallie succeeded the most patrician of Scottish Tories, George Younger, as MP for Ayr. His selection as a Thatcherite standard-bearer at a time of bitter controversy over the poll tax – which he ardently supported – and other divisive issues caused deep rifts within the constituency party. Along with the 10 other remaining Scottish Tories, Gallie lost his seat in 1997. He had become vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservatives in 1995 and, when a leader was required for the first Scottish parliament elections, Gallie stood unsuccessfully against the more moderate David McLetchie. In 1999, Gallie narrowly failed (by 25 votes) to be elected as the first MSP for Ayre, but he went to Holyrood anyway as a \"list\" MSP for the South of Scotland, under the system of proportional representation. He then sought to regain the Ayr seat in the Westminster election of 2001, but lost to Labour's Sandra Osborne. Although an occasional thorn in the side of Major's government, he was not by nature a rebel against the party whip. While strongly opposed to the European Union and all its works, Gallie never became one of the \"bastards\" who plagued Major's administration. Indeed his only notable rebellion was on the more esoteric matter of how Scotland's nuclear industry would be privatised. This derived from the fact that Gallie had spent much of his professional career in the power generation sector. He and two other Scottish Tories argued for Scottish Nuclear to be privatised separately from the remainder of the nuclear power industry, with a view to retaining headquarters jobs in Scotland. The eventual compromise was that the privatised British Energy established its headquarters at East Kilbride. Gallie leant heavily on his genuine working-class background to support the assertion that he was more in touch with popular opinion than many of his Labour opponents. He was born in Portsmouth to George and Ivy Gallie, and later moved to Fife, where he was educated at Dunfermline high school and Kirkcaldy technical college. He then served an apprenticeship as an electrical fitter at the Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife before spending four years at sea (1960-64) as an engineer with the Ben Line. He said that it was Harold Macmillan's \"you've never had it so good\" speech that inspired him to become a Tory. However, it was not until he moved to Ayrshire, in pursuance of his managerial career with the South of Scotland Electricity Board, that he became seriously involved in politics, first through a local campaign against rating revaluation and then as a local councillor in Cunninghame. This coincided with the leadership of Thatcher and a political direction with which he enthusiastically identified. Gallie stood in two solidly Labour seats, Cunninghame South in 1983 and Dunfermline West in 1987, before winning the Ayr nomination. His Holyrood career lasted eight years. During most of this time he was also the principal carer for his wife, Marion, whom he had married in 1964 and who suffered from a long and debilitating illness. Gallie's diligence in this role, travelling back and forth between Holyrood and Ayr each day, won him widespread admiration from political friends and foes. The Scottish Tory leader, Annabel Goldie, praised Gallie's devotion during this period as \"humbling and inspiring\". She also praised the \"passion and enthusiasm\" he brought to his political beliefs. Marion died in 2006. Gallie is survived by his son, Craig, and his daughter, Kirsteen. • Philip Roy Gallie, politician, born 3 June 1939; died 24 January 2011"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/sep/23/nuclearpower.fossilfuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-22T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power and coal crucial to UK, says Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/23/nuclearpower.fossilfuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/sep/23/nuclearpower.fossilfuels","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power and coal crucial to UK, says Hutton","bodyText":"Britain needs to undergo a \"renaissance in nuclear power\", and coal will continue to be a \"critically important fuel\" for the country, the business secretary, John Hutton, said yesterday. In a speech which drew immediate criticism from environmental groups, Hutton said that the two controversial sources of energy were crucial to ensure that Britain retained a secure energy supply. The international battle for energy security poses a threat to Britain's competitiveness and its \"sovereignty as a nation\", he said. \"It means a renaissance in nuclear power. Low carbon, reliable, secure ... And because energy security is a first thought, not an afterthought, I will not turn my back on another critical source of energy security for the UK, coal.\" The business secretary took a swipe at David Cameron, who has said he would ensure that a new generation of \"unabated coal power plants\" could not be built by imposing a California-style emissions performance standard. Hutton said: \"I understand that people feel passionate about this issue. Others, like the Tories, see an opportunity for pandering. But coal is critically important for the UK. Flexible. Available. Reducing our reliance on imported gas.\" Hutton's remarks show that Labour believes Cameron could be vulnerable on energy as high oil prices and the wider global economic downturn make people wary of restrictions on fuel even if they are designed to help the environment. Cameron has since indicated that he would be prepared to allow a new generation of nuclear power stations, though he warns that he would not provide any \"blank cheques\". Hutton said Britain had to look beyond weathering the current economic storm to make changes - \"emerging stronger and fitter to seize the new manufacturing opportunities in the green economy and global markets of tomorrow\". Greenpeace criticised Hutton's support for coal-fired power stations, saying they would make a \"colossal contribution\" to climate change. Executive director, John Sauven, said: \"John Hutton somehow manages to sound like a cross between Arthur Scargill and Margaret Thatcher ... The Iron Lady said she would build as many new nuclear stations as Hutton is promising but she managed just one because the economics didn't stand up - and they still don't.\" Robin Webster of Friends of the Earth added: \"Peddling a new generation of coal-fired power stations before we even know if carbon capture and storage is going to work is dangerous and misleading. Hutton has failed to grasp the serious threat posed by climate change or the huge potential of renewable energy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2011/mar/18/technology-links-newsbucket","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-18T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Boot up: Delicious to sell?, slower iOS apps explained, Elop talks, and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/18/technology-links-newsbucket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2011/mar/18/technology-links-newsbucket","fields":{"headline":"Boot up: Delicious to sell?, slower iOS apps explained, Elop talks, and more","bodyText":"A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team.

Though Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has criticised the irreversible startup as \"premature\", Bushehr is in fact a long-delayed fiasco predating the Iranian revolution. By contract, the spent fuel rods, containing weapons-grade plutonium, are to be returned to Russia. Uneasy faith that Iran will keep its promise, if only because it still lacks the technology to process the rods at home, is the sole reason that America and its allies are not hysterical. Whether nominally safe or not, Bushehr foreshadows Iran's more ominous nuclear plans, which the Obama administration's hectoring and cajoling have signally failed to discourage. \"Iran is entitled to civil nuclear power,\" Hillary Clinton sermonised in Moscow in March. \"It is a nuclear weapons programme that it is not entitled to.\" While arguably no country is \"entitled\" to possess weaponry capable of ending life on this planet as we know it, for the nation with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world to rebuke others for developing the same technology is bewilderingly hypocritical. Yet this is hypocrisy to which we've grown so accustomed that nobody seems to notice it any more. The nuclear club is meant to be exclusive. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty recognises the five permanent members of the UN security council as \"nuclear weapons states\", committing them to act as bouncers at the club door. The treaty theoretically obliges these members to ditch their own nukes in the fullness of time – an aptly pompous expression, for an otherwise nuke-free world would make a rogue state with even one bomb so powerful that the chances of universal disarmament are zero. Ever since Hiroshima, we've been faced with the depressing fact that you cannot un-invent something. You also cannot retain a device for yourself and then lecture others that they are not \"entitled\" to it. Iran is, alas, just as entitled to nuclear weapons as the US and Britain. Ditto North Korea. All the Obama administration has the moral and political right to assert is: \"We don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons.\" To which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would quite sensibly respond: \"So what?\" Virtually no government aside from Tehran itself wants Iran to have nuclear weapons, including its Middle Eastern neighbours, just as it's sickening worldwide that North Korea's Dear Leader will likely bequeath a couple of nukes to a son who promises to carry on the family tradition of being even crazier than dad. Yet since promotion of nonproliferation by nuclear states has been chronically two-faced for years, the Obama administration needs to be cannier, and more sensitive to how preaching that \"You've no right to what we've got in buckets\" sounds to hostile ears. Such arrogance can only backfire. By conceit, the US is one of a handful of states righteous enough to safeguard the world from the very Armageddon they could themselves unleash. By implication, Iran is an untrustworthy custodian of the means to apocalypse. But this self-serving pose surely elicits \"Who do you think you are?\" from non-nuclear sovereign nations. Inside Iran \"entitlement\" rhetoric can only inflame nationalistic indignation, inverting neatly into propaganda for Ahmadinejad. It throws down a gauntlet – and invites defiance. Granted, international leverage with Iran is limited. Yet what's required is competent manipulation, which means appealing to self-interest. In addition to brandishing sanctions, America needs to drop the posturing and talk turkey: \"OK, you want nukes. Given the way we treat the folks who went out and got them even when they were told not to, that's understandable. We handle Pakistan with kid gloves, and when they went nuclear we did little more than say: 'Well. That's a drag.' Likewise when Pyongyang sank that South Korean warship, we huffed and puffed and grumbled something like 'That wasn't very nice', but nothing happened. Because we're afraid of these guys. So sure, you want us to be afraid of you, too. \"But have you read the cover story of this August's Atlantic Monthly? It assembles an unnervingly convincing case that if you gatecrash our gentlemen's club, Israel will hit you with massive air strikes, just as they took out Saddam's Osirak reactor in 1981, and a North Korean-built reactor in Syria in 2007. We realise you don't believe us, but we don't totally control these people. Think about it: do you want a war in the Middle East? When you reflect back on the Iran-Iraq war, don't you feel tired? You've sky-high inflation and unemployment. Can you afford a war? Wouldn't you rather spend the money torturing protesters and executing adulterers with something a little more sophisticated than rocks?\" All right, maybe Clinton could contrive a more persuasive line than that. But any pragmatic appeal would beat the kind of phoney finger-wagging that notoriously flops with one's children: scolding a teenager for smoking, and jabbing a lit cigarette for emphasis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/01/japanese-nuclear-workers-groundwater","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T13:57:51Z","webTitle":"Japanese nuclear workers face new threat from radioactive groundwater","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/01/japanese-nuclear-workers-groundwater","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/01/japanese-nuclear-workers-groundwater","fields":{"headline":"Japanese nuclear workers face new threat from radioactive groundwater","bodyText":"Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant face new threats to their health after radiation exceeding safety levels was found to have seeped into groundwater near the facility. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), was the target of further criticism amid reports that some workers at the site had not been provided with personal radiation monitors. Tepco's handling of the crisis has come under closer scrutiny since three workers were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation last week. They have all been discharged from hospital after suffering no ill effects. Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency, Nisa, ordered the firm to review its latest radiation measurements taken from the air, seawater and groundwater, saying they seemed suspiciously high. Earlier on Friday Tepco reported that groundwater beneath one of the plant's six reactors contained levels of radioactive iodine 10,000 times higher than government standards. \"We have our suspicions about their isotope analysis,\" said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a Nisa spokesman. Tepco said that a computer software fault could be responsible for the high readings, but added that the data could turn out to be accurate. Experts said it was unlikely that the radioactive iodine-131 found nearly 15 metres (50ft) below one of the reactors would find its way into drinking water. For several days authorities have issued assurances that none of the radiation readings are high enough to present a threat to people living beyond the 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone. But the risks being taken by about 600 technicians, engineers, firefighters and troops as they struggle to contain radiation leaks have only increased. Tepco admitted it had not been able to provide enough dosimeters to teams of workers who are completing gruelling three-day shifts in an attempt to remove and dispose of radioactive pools of water and prevent damaged fuel rods from going into full meltdown. Tepco said it had secured additional gauges to replace hundreds that were damaged in the 11 March tsunami. \"We must ensure the workers' health and safety, but we also face a pressing need to get the work done as quickly as possible,\" Nishiyama said, adding that sharing meters up until now had been \"unavoidable\". Soon after the disaster the health ministry raised the maximum radiation level to which each worker can safely be exposed from 100 millisieverts a year to 250 millisieverts a year to enable them to spend more time in contaminated areas. Nisa said that 21 workers had so far been exposed to radiation exceeding 100 millisieverts, although tests have shown that no one has been exposed to radiation high enough to damage their health. Sumio Imoto, a spokesman for one of Tepco's main subcontractors, said its labourers were being looked after and were not taking unnecessary risks. \"The safety of our employees is our primary concern,\" he said, \"but keeping up morale is a big challenge.\" Robert Peter Gale, a US medical researcher who has been advising the Japanese government, said: \"There's a huge difference between whole-body and partial-body radiation. \"One of my primary considerations is the geometry of the reactor and the likelihood that people are in a configuration that would give them full-body radiation. It's not impossible, but it's highly unlikely. They have to be exposed in their entirety from three to four metres to get a whole-body dose. This is not a kamikaze situation.\" According to the few reliable descriptions of conditions at the plant, the workers are given just two meals a day – crackers and a small carton of vegetable juice for breakfast; dried rice and canned fish or chicken for dinner – and take naps in cramped corridors on lead-lined sheets to limit their exposure to radiation. \"That's where they sleep, with only one blanket each to wrap themselves around,\" said Kazuma Yokota, a Nisa official who spent five days at the plant. Yokota said the rush to save the plant meant some workers had been unable to change their underwear, while high radiation levels were hampering the arrival of fresh supplies. Conditions have marginally improved amid widespread admiration for the workers, initially nicknamed the Fukushima 50 because they worked in groups of that number. Their daily bottled water allowance has increased and the government has vowed to improve food supplies. The workers' nightly meeting ends with shouts of \"ganbaro!\" (\"let's keep going\"). The anonymous workers have little or no contact with the outside world while they are on site, and media interviews are discouraged. \"They are doing their best while they aren't even able to contact members of their family,\" Yokota said. After three days' work they spend three days at J-Village, a nearby sports complex, for a shower, proper food and sleep. \"It isn't perfect, but it does provide a place for the workers to pull back and get some rest before they have to go back in,\" said a Tepco spokesman, Hirota Oyama. \"They can eat fresh vegetables, something they can't do on the site.\" The prime minister, Naoto Kan, will visit the sports complex on Saturday to show his support. His spokesman, Yukio Edano, said: \"I humbly bow to the workers and officials who are doing difficult jobs at the plant's frontline.\" Japanese media reported that nuclear workers had been offered up to 400,000 yen (£3,000) a day to work inside the crippled reactors. Before the crisis some contract workers were reportedly being paid as little as 10,000 to 20,000 yen (£75 to £150) a day. Tepco said it was considering using \"jumpers\", or workers who enter highly radioactive reactors to perform short but essential tasks, then evacuate quickly to avoid prolonged exposure to radiation. An early return home is unlikely given the perilous condition of the plant three weeks after the tsunami. As Kan warned on Friday: \"I am prepared for a long-term battle over the Fukushima nuclear plant and to win this battle. \"At the current stage we cannot say that the plant has been sufficiently stabilised. But we are preparing for all kinds of situations and I am convinced that the plant can be stabilised. We cannot say at this stage when this will happen, but we are doing our best.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/mar/31/rise-hi-tech-vending-machine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-31T19:30:00Z","webTitle":"The rise of the hi-tech vending machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/31/rise-hi-tech-vending-machine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/mar/31/rise-hi-tech-vending-machine","fields":{"headline":"The rise of the hi-tech vending machine","bodyText":"In the early 1990s, environmental campaigners in Japan used to highlight the fact that the nation's 3.6m vending machines collectively used electricity equal to the output of one nuclear power station. Such a comparison holds extra poignancy today, of course, especially when you consider there are now twice the number of vending machines in the country that famously just can't get enough of them. In fact, with the country experiencing rolling blackouts following the earthquake on 11 March, a grassroots campaign was launched to persuade Coca-Cola to switch off its 980,000 vending machines to help conserve energy. An executive from another drinks firm was quick to retaliate: \"But vending machines constitute a lifeline for residents.\" Are vending machines now such an essential component of our instant-fix, consumer lifestyles that we can't do without them, even in an emergency? \"There is one vending machine for every 23 people in Japan,\" says Jonathan Hilder, chief executive of the Automatic Vending Association. \"They are the biggest vending market in the world and there is a machine on every street corner selling anything from drinks and live crabs to music and underwear. In the UK, there is a vending machine for every 55 people. But expect vending machines to get ever-more commonplace as they get ever-more sophisticated.\" Vending has come a long way since the ancient Greeks relied on Hero's coin-operated machine to dispense holy water at temples. The first machines appeared in the UK during the late Victorian era, selling postcards before moving on to the ubiquitous machines we see today selling items such as chocolate bars, stamps and cigarettes (soon to be outlawed) that are found in railway stations and other busy public places. The thing that defines these vending machines is their crude, mechanical simplicity and invariable reluctance – despite often receiving a Fonz-like whack from the frustrated purchaser's clenched fist – to accept coins without rejecting at least a third of them. (The introduction of new 5p and 10p coins by the Royal Mint was recently delayed until next year after lobbying by the vending industry saying it would cost £17m to recalibrate all its machines.) Hilder says the common perception that vending machines \"don't accept most coins\" is now largely false. \"The technology has come on enormously in recent years,\" he says. \"And don't blame it all on the industry: 2.8% of £1 coins are forgeries. \"More than seven billion products are vended in the UK each year. The machines offer superb convenience in an age when we crave convenience.\" The staples will always be popular, but vending is undergoing a revolution in terms of the range of items machines offer, as well as how they are operated. For example, hot drinks are the most popular vended item in the UK today, with 60% of vending machines now found in the workplace. \"It's not so much that you can get a hot drink now – that's been the case for years – but the variety on offer is fast increasing,\" says Hilder. \"In the past five years, there's been a boom in larger drink sizes, with 9oz and even 12oz cups becoming the norm. And rather than rely on instant coffee, some machines are even grinding their own coffee beans.\" The gentrification of vending reflects our ever-demanding and discerning tastes elsewhere across food and drink retailing. But there is also another reason why the vending industry is keen to supersize and diversify its \"offerings\" – profit. The profit margin on a vended snack, such as a bar of chocolate or packet of crisps, is 30%-40%, says Hilder. But with coffee, the profit margin leaps to 70%. It is beyond food-and-drink vending, though, where the real innovation is to be found. For example, vending machines are now used to distribute methadone in some prisons – not for the convenience of the prisoner, but, by using retinal and fingerprint scanners on the machines, wardens say they can safely ensure it goes to the right person. A Taiwanese company recently developed a vending machine with face-recognition cameras to help it recommend hair-growing tonics and razors to men. And a Canadian firm is developing a \"remote-pharmacy dispensing\" machine with customers speaking to a real-life pharmacist via videophone before scanning their ID to get their medicines. In fact, improving security is now one of the principal reasons why retailers say they are turning to vending machines: Selfridges has trialled vending designer jeans following a spate of thefts. And increased security also allows retailers to sell things they would never dare normally sell over the counter to the public. Somewhat perplexingly, gold bars are now even being vended in a handful of international airports. Hilder believes the blending together of security and convenience will mean the vending machine becomes an integral component of our 24-hour, instant-access lifestyles in the future. As mobile-phone technology improves, and payment systems move towards \"wave pay\" (as with London's Oyster card), vending points in public and workplaces will be used both as places to buy goods directly, but also as delivery points for online shopping – a cross between a left-luggage locker and a conventional vending machine. \"Most new vending machines now are touch-screen, giving users a wealth of information and options,\" says Hilder. \"And once a universal wave-pay system is adopted – which will be about five to 10 years away – the options will be incredible for what can be vended.\" But until that day arrives, food and drink will continue to dominate vending. Earlier this month, Coca-Cola revealed a new drinks vending machine it claimed had been in development for six years. Called the \"Freestyle\", the touch-screen machine offers up to 106 varieties of beverage. At its launch in Atlanta, the company's director of marketing offered some bold claims for the machine: \"To our knowledge there is nothing like this in the world. This is the future of fountain dispensing.\" • This article was amended on 1 April 2011.

The second goal in particular, a sweeping counterattack, showed the fluid beauty of the Lobanovskyi machine. Vasyl Rats advanced down the left, drew two men and played the ball inside to Ihor Belanov. Belanov took two touches and, as the centre-back moved across to close him down, he, without so much as a glance, laid the ball right for Vadym Yevtushenko. He moved one pace forward, forcing the full-back inside to close him down, then instinctively flicked the ball right for the overlapping Oleh Blokhin, who ran on to his pass and, as the goalkeeper came off his line, lofted the ball over him. The goal was rapid, simple, devastatingly co-ordinated – everything Lobanovskyi insisted football should be. After a wobble against Utrecht in the first round, when they lost 2-1 in the Netherlands before a 4-1 win in Ukraine, Dynamo had been awesome during that cup run. Universitatea Craiova were dismissed 5-2 on aggregate in the second round, Rapid Vienna 9-2 in the quarter-final and Dukla Prague 4-1 in the semi-final. They won every home leg by at least a three-goal margin and won the Soviet league in 1985 and 1986. And to think that, 17 years earlier, Lobanovskyi nearly gave it all up to become a plumber. Lobanovskyi had been a talented left-winger, an individualistic player who ultimately fell out with Viktor Maslov, the great pioneer of the pressing game that he would take to new heights. The trigger for the breakdown of their relationship remains disputed – some say Maslov made the then-fastidious Lobanovskyi drink horilka at a lunch after a flight had been delayed; others that Lobanovskyi refused to be involved in arranging the result of a game. Whatever the cause, player and coach had never seen eye to eye, largely because their conceptions of the game, at the time, were so different. Lobanovskyi was always an intense, cussed individual. When he was 22 he helped Dynamo to their long-awaited first Supreme League title, but remained aloof from the general rejoicing, as was made clear by what was intended as a celebratory visit to the Science and Research Institute of the Construction Industry with his team-mates Oleh Bazylevych and Vladimir Levchenko. \"Yes, we have won the league,\" Volodymyr Sabaldyr, a Kyivan scientist and long-time amateur footballer, remembered him saying in the face of excited congratulations. \"But so what? Sometimes we played badly. We just got more points than other teams who played worse than us. I can't accept your praise as there are no grounds for it.\" Sabaldyr asked him how it felt to achieve something that had been a dream for Kyivans for decades. \"A realised dream ceases to be a dream,\" Lobanovskyi replied. \"What is your dream as a scientist? Your degree? Your doctorate? Your post-doctoral thesis?\" \"Maybe,\" Sabaldyr replied. \"But a real scientist dreams about making a contribution to scientific development, about leaving his mark on it.\" \"And there you have your answer.\" The conversation is telling, for it suggests the analytical, rational mind was already at work. Born in 1939, Lobanovskyi grew up in the great Soviet age of science. He was a teenager when the USSR opened its first nuclear power station and sent Sputnik into space, and Kyiv itself was the centre of the Soviet computer industry. The first cybernetic institute in the USSR was opened there in 1957 and quickly became acknowledged as a world leader in automated control systems, artificial intelligence and mathematical modelling. It was there in 1963 that an early prototype of the modern PC was developed. While Lobanovskyi was studying heating engineering at the Kyivan Polytechnic Institute, the potential of computers and their possible applications in almost all spheres was becoming apparent. It was exciting, it was new and it is no great surprise that Lobanovskyi should have been gripped by the spirit of technological optimism, yet that left him conflicted. The player in him wanted to have fun, dribble and invent tricks. His training drove him to a systematic approach. Eventually, after a chance meeting with the statistician Anatoliy Zelentsov at a party, it was the latter that won out. Football became for him a system of 22 elements – two sub-systems of 11 elements – moving within a defined area (the pitch) and subject to a series of restrictions (the laws of the game). If the two sub-systems were equal, the outcome would be a draw. If one were stronger, they would win. The aspect that Lobanovskyi found most fascinating was that the sub-systems were subject to a peculiarity: the efficiency of the sub-system was greater than the sum of the efficiencies of the elements that comprise it. That, as Lobanovskyi saw it, meant football was ripe for the application of the cybernetic techniques being taught at the Polytechnic Institute. Football, he concluded, was less about individuals than about coalitions and the connections between them. \"When we are talking about tactical evolution,\" Lobanovskyi and Zelentsov wrote in their book, The Methodological Basis of the Development of Training Models, \"the first thing we have in mind is to strive for new courses of action that will not allow the opponent to adapt to our style of play. If an opponent has adjusted himself to our style of play and found a counterplay, then we need to find new a new strategy. That is the dialectic of the game. You have to go forward in such a way and with such a range of attacking options that it will force the opponent to make a mistake. In other words, it's necessary to force the opponent into the condition you want them to be in. One of the most important means of doing that is to vary the size of the playing area.\" Others, particularly in the Netherlands, were coming to a similar conclusion; the difference is that Lobanovskyi came to favour his hard-pressing style from first principles, recognising the logic of the tactics Maslov had implemented intuitively. After four unremarkable years at Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, he moved to Dynamo, where he won five league titles and the 1975 Cup Winners' Cup in his first spell in charge. Yet some part of football will always be beyond science. There will be bad luck, players will fall out of form or will lose faith in their coach. That was what happened in the qualifiers for Euro 84, which Lobanovskyi's USSR failed to reach after a defeat by Portugal in which the only goal came from a penalty for a foul committed outside the box. When he returned to Dynamo and they finished only 10th, doubts about the Lobanovskyian method grew. The more individualistic style of Dinamo Minsk and Spartak Moscow came to prominence. But Lobanovskyi remained confident in his science. \"A path always remains a path,\" he said. \"It's a path during the day, it's a path during the night and it's a path during the dawn.\" That final in Lyon, and Blokhin's goal in particular, were his vindication. He went on to become the most successful manager in Soviet and then Ukrainian history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/226331","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-30T19:20:13Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Fears over safety of Pakistan's nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/226331","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/226331","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Fears over safety of Pakistan's nuclear weapons","bodyText":"Tuesday, 22 September 2009, 14:13 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 LONDON 002198 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 09/21/2019 TAGS PARM, KNNP, PREL, CH, EG, FR, IN, IR, IZ, JA, KN, PK, RS, SL, UK SUBJECT: U/S TAUSCHER'S MEETINGS WITH FS MILIBAND AND OTHER HMG OFFICIALS Classified By: Political Counselor Robin Quinville for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (S/NF) Summary: Under Secretary Tauscher held meetings in London on September 2-4 on the margins of the P5 Conference on Confidence Building Measures Towards Nuclear Disarmament with Foreign Secretary David Miliband, Simon McDonald, Head of the Foreign and Defence Policy Secretariat at the Cabinet Office, Mariot Leslie, Director General, Defence and Intelligence, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and Jon Day, MOD Director General for Security Policy. The UK interlocutors expressed broad support for USG goals with regard to nonproliferation and disarmament and highlighted the need for close P3 and P5 coordination in the lead-up to the UNSC Heads of Goverment Summit and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Confererence (RevCon). They also predicted that UK arms control policy would not be affected either by next year's elections or the upcoming Strategic Defense Review. McDonald cited the need to get tough with Iran if it did not respond to overtures by the end of September. U/S Tauscher expressed continued commitment to ratification of the Defense Trade Treaty and noted that she is working with the Senate to resolve questions concerning implementation. End Summary Welcoming U.S. Leadership ------------------------- 2. (S/NF) While in London for the September 3-4 P5 Conference on Confidence Building Measures Towards Nuclear Disarmament, U/S Tauscher held separate meetings September 2-4 with Foreign Secretary David Miliband, Simon McDonald, Head of the Foreign and Defence Policy Secretariat at the Cabinet Office, Mariot Leslie, Director General, Defence and Intelligence, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and Jon Day, MOD Director General for Security Policy. The British interlocutors underscored that the UK welcomes U.S. leadership on nonproliferation, disarmament and arms control. FS Miliband expressed appreciation for President Obama's Prague speech, observing that the process for getting to \"a world at or close to zero in terms of nuclear arms is not a straight line\" but is long and complex. McDonald said that for the last forty years the nuclear states have downplayed the obligation to spread civil nuclear power and to disarm; President Obama's leadership presents an opportunity to change that dynamic. DG Leslie observed that UK decision makers are \"fired up by how the President has made the (nonproliferation) agenda his own.\" Prime Minister Brown wants to \"refresh and refurbish\" the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), she said. DG Day said he was \"delighted\" that the U.S. has \"resumed leadership\" on nonproliferation, arms control and disarmament. Maintaining P3 and P5 Unity --------------------------- 3. (S/NF) Leslie stressed that the UK position is \"really very similar to your Administration on nearly everything.\" The UK's goal is for the P5 to work well together but we should \"not scare the horses,\" which means \"not scaring off the French\" and \"keeping the Chinese and Russians on board.\" She acknowledged that it was \"hard to get everyone together\" for the 9/3-4 P5 Conference, but expressed hope that it would help cement P5 unity in the lead-up to the NPT Review Confererence (RevCon). Day acknowledged that the 9/3-4 P5 Conference was not a vehicle designed to make progress by \"leaps and bounds.\" He stressed that \"the engagement is valuable\" and would help cement P5 unity. 4. (S/NF) We need a strong, but unanimous, signal from the UN Security Council (UNSC) at the UNSC Heads of Government Summit, Simon McDonald stressed, noting that the first draft resolution was a disappointment. The UK interlocutors agreed on the importance of P5 unity at the summit, as well as on the importance of close P3 and P5 coordination in the lead-up to the summit and to the NPT RevCon. McDonald also observed that Libya was on the UNSC and that the P5 should take positive note of the fact that Libya has made a \"strategic shift\" on nuclear proliferation. France and P3 Unity ------------------- 5. (S/NF) DG Leslie said that the UK had done a \"lot of hard LONDON 00002198 002 OF 005 work and expressed a commitment to disarmament...and the French are uncomfortable with this.\" Leslie said that the UK \"gets on well\" with the French, but the French are \"excessively worried about what they view as unilateral UK disarmament.\" She said that P3 talks would help maintain P3 unity; \"We need to reassure France,\" she said. Leslie characterized closer U.S.-France relations as \"extremely healthy.\" 6. (S/NF) U/S Tauscher, Leslie, and Day agreed to regular P3 meetings, starting in October, to help cement P3 unity. French interlocutors also agreed, during separate bilateral meetings with Tauscher, on the importance of regular P3 consultations. Missile Defense and the Nuclear Posture Review --------------------------------------------- - 7. (S/NF) U/S Tauscher described the Missile Defense review underway in Washington, with emphasis on countering the Iranian missile threat to Europe with proven technology. She also described the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which would replace the 2002 NPR and would address questions such as extended deterrence and security assurances. Her UK interlocutors expressed considerable interest in both reviews, and she made clear the U.S. would consult bilaterally and with NATO as soon as the reviews progress to that point. Political consensus on a Strategic Defense Review --------------------------------------------- ---- 8. (S/NF) Day acknowledged that \"the next year will be pretty disruptive\" in the UK as the two major parties prepare for the next general election. He stressed that both the Labour and Conservative parties are committed to a Strategic Defense Review after the election. He predicted that neither political conflict between the two major parties nor the defense review would affect arms control policy, although he advised that these factors \"may distract the attention\" of political leaders. He predicted that \"defense will be a bigger issue than it usually is\" during the British electoral period. He cited intense debate over Britain's role in Afghanistan and the \"defense budget crisis\" as two prominent issues. 9. (S/NF) Day opined that \"mobilizing\" NATO allies after General McChrystal released the results of his review would be \"very difficult.\" \"Our message\" to the U.S. is \"bear with us... we will continue to work closely with you,\" Day said. He pledged to work closely with the U.S. on the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and National Posture Review (NPR) as well as on the UK's Strategic Defense Review. In regard to the UK review, Day observed that he had worked on the last review in 1997-98, and he bemoaned the lack of institutional memory within HMG regarding the review process. 10. (S/NF) Day also promised that the UK had \"put measures in place to protect your interests\" during the UK inquiry into the causes of the Iraq war. He noted that Iraq seems no longer to be a major issue in the U.S., but he said it would become a big issue -- a \"feeding frenzy\" -- in the UK \"when the inquiry takes off.\" Iran ---- 11. (S/NF) Tauscher made clear that Iran needed to respond to the P5 1 offer prior to the UNGA, at which point there would be a stock-taking; absent progress, attention would turn to substantially stronger sanctions. FS Milband opined that U.S. Administration is \"rightly trying to overcome a deficit of prejudice and mistrust in a relatively short time\" by diplomatic outreach to Iran. He continued that the Iranian elections were a \"bad outcome\" -- an outcome that had given extremists the upper hand and resulted in a \"culling of reformists.\" Miliband said that, in his opinion, Iran's extremist government would not make concessions in a short time. Nonetheless, the U.S. \"Administration's support for a diplomatic solution is very wise.\" He praised the impact of financial sanctions spearheaded by Treasury U/S Levey. Leslie asserted that the Iranian administration is \"in a state of flux\" and \"not focused,\" so probably unable to respond to overtures. LONDON 00002198 003 OF 005 12. (S/NF) McDonald stressed that the PM supports the President's outreach efforts to Iran, but this outreach should not be \"open ended.\" The UK view is that \"if Iran is not responsive, we have to get serious.\" UK experts have concluded that stronger sanctions should be in place by the end of the year if Iran is not significantly responsive by the end of September. McDonald observed that it would take some time to negotiate a UNSCR; in the meantime, the UK is considering national steps it could take as well as possible steps the EU could take. HMG shares NSA Jones' view that proliferation problems posed by Iran and North Korea should be addressed together, not as separate, unrelated issues, McDonald said. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) ------------------------------------ 13. (S/NF) UK interlocutors sought an update from U/S Tauscher on the progress toward U.S. Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) -- and on the President's leadership on CTBT ratification. Tauscher said the ratification of the CTBT had high priority. START had a certain urgency, given the December 5 expiration; we were working in parallel to prepare for ratification of CTBT, including a new National Academy study, a new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), and a funded program to modernize our nuclear infrastructure. UK interlocutors made clear they would welcome U.S. CTBT ratification, which would be a tangible sign to the world of U.S. commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. McDonald noted that since the 1993 Executive Order, the U.S. has acted as if the CTBT had been ratified, which he characterized as an argument that could persuade reluctant senators. UK interlocutors also sought an update from Tauscher on the progress of START negotiations and the status of the NPR. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ----------------------------------------- 14. (S/NF) \"We need to put some steel in Director General-elect Amano,\" Miliband opined. Amano has a key role and he \"must be a leader and a consensus-builder who reports faithfully what experts tell him.\" McDonald observed that the IAEA seems more prepared than it has in the past to address Iranian conduct. Tauscher agreed we need to make Amano a success. Russia-Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) --------------------------------------------- - 15. (S/NF) Leslie commended U.S.-Russian progress on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) talks. She said that the UK was looking for the U.S. to deal with Russia since \"our relations (with Russia) are very poor.\" Leslie said that despite UK-Russia bilateral problems, HMG would be able to work with Russia through the NPT process and she expressed hope that Russia \"could do the right thing\" to address global proliferation. She noted the Russian proposal for a conference that could help address Egyptian concerns. Day opined that after START negotiations are successfully concluded, Russia might be inclined to seek \"another deal\" in regard to Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), since such discussions would \"keep them at the top table\" in terms of negotiations. China, Pakistan --------------- 16. (S/NF) Leslie flagged the \"inconvenient truth\" that \"China is building its nuclear arsenal.\" She evoked an arms race in the Pacific in light of India's nuclear program. Nonetheless, Leslie said she was optimistic regarding China's commitment to multilateral cooperation and she suggested that the U.S. and the UK should push China for progress \"until they say 'stop it'.\" She noted that the Chinese had \"pretty much\" said a year ago that if the U.S. ratifies the CTBT, China would follow suit. Further, China has \"dumped\" Pakistan in the Conference on Disarmament (CD), which is a \"good sign.\" Tauscher urged P5 action to get Pakistan to stop blocking progress in the CD on the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT). 17. (S/NF) The UK has deep concerns about the safety and LONDON 00002198 004 OF 005 security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons, and China could play a big role in stabilizing Pakistan, Leslie said. Pakistan has accepted nuclear safety help, but under the IAEA flag (albeit British technicians). The Pakistanis worry that the U.S. \"will drop in and take their nukes,\" Leslie said. 18. (S/NF) Day expressed support for the development of a \"cold war\"-like relationship between India and Pakistan that would \"introduce a degree of certainty\" between the two countries in their dealings. He noted that recent intelligence indicates that Pakistan \"is not going in a good direction.\" Pakistan sees the debate about Afghanistan in the U.S. and the UK as demonstrating that the allies lack the will to maintain their commitment there. The Pakistanis also believe that their recent successes against extremists in the Swat valley validate their belief that they can deal with their own internal problems without changing their approach toward India. Day asked if the U.S. would be \"obliged\" to cut relations with Pakistan if the military took over again; he said that the last time the military assumed power the UK had maintained military-to-military ties. Day also asked for the U.S. perspective on Nawaz Sharif, whom he described as \"potentially less venal\" than other Pakistani leaders. Nonproliferation and Public Diplomacy ------------------------------------- 19. (S/NF) Leslie opined that P5 states are \"losing the public diplomacy arguments about nonproliferation\" and civil nuclear power, with the P3 and the P5 \"being portrayed as the bad guy.\" Day expressed a similar sentiment, noting that there is \"no real recognition\" of what the UK has done in terms of nonproliferation and disarmament, \"either in our own media or worldwide.\" U/S Tauscher agreed that we all need to do a much better job of getting our narrative out, and noted that the State Department has brought in new people to help to do that. 20. (S/NF) Leslie acknowledged that there had been divisions within HMG about the strategy for addressing proliferation. In Leslie's view, the risk of proliferation is a bigger threat than terrorism but it ranks lower than terrorism on the public's list of perceived threats. She flagged efforts both by states and by terrorist groups to obtain nuclear weapons. She cited former FS Beckett's speech at the Carnegie International Nonproliferation Conference in June 2007 as setting out the UK's commitment to a nuclear free world. In HMG's view, President Obama's Prague speech expressed the same commitment. Disarmament alone )- without successfully addressing proliferation )- would not make the world safer, so \"we need to manage disarmament,\" Leslie stated. She rejected the French assertion that that the U.S. and the UK are \"starting a (public) debate that is not there\" by publicly addressing issues of nuclear disarmament. Civil Nuclear Cooperation ------------------------- 21. (S/NF) UK interlocutors noted HMG's commitment to civil nuclear power and that the nuclear weapons states have done a poor job in terms of Article IV of the NPT. FS Miliband commented that the nuclear weapons states have a credibility problem with the non-nuclear weapons states. Leslie said that the UK had demonstrated its commitment to \"moving forward\" civil nuclear issues, citing the UK-hosted and organized nuclear fuel cycle conference in March 2009 as an example. Tauscher agreed that we should support nuclear power and nuclear cooperation in a manner that does not lead to the spread of dangerous technologies, citing our agreement with the UAE as an example. Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) ----------------------- 22. (S/NF) FS Miliband asked about the status of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), insisting \"we are not trying to keep people from bearing arms in the USA.\" He asked if it was \"conceivable\" for the U.S. to ratify the treaty. Tauscher stated she was not optimistic given the Second Amendment issues being raised by opponents, but said the Administration was planning to review the ATT and we are prepared to listen to the UK make its case on this issue. FS Miliband said that the UK launched its campaign in favor of the ATT in September 2008 with the support of some U.S. companies. LONDON 00002198 005 OF 005 23. (S/NF) Day observed that there is \"sometimes a sense\" that the FCO \"pushes\" the ATT while the MOD opposes it. He stressed that the MOD and the UK defense industry \"support strongly\" the ATT. He said that he had personally seen the impact of MANPADS in Sierra Leone, and stated that ground to air missile proliferation is a major problem that the ATT could address. \"Given our operational deployments in Afghanistan, we're focused on\" the ATT,\" he said. NATO - Strategic Concept ------------------------ 24. (S/NF) Day raised the NATO Strategic Concept review, predicting a major debate in the Alliance about deterrence and its strategic dimensions. A \"major objective\" should be \"to minimize fallout\" on nuclear issues. He noted that the Secretary General (SYG) would prepare the first draft. The North Atlantic Council (NAC) will need to review the final product since the first stage of work is done among a small group of nations and many others will be \"suspicious.\" The direction of NATO's debate will depend on the outcome of the German elections: the Social Democratic Party (SPD) could force a debate, while the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) would not, Day said. Day volunteered that he had been \"soured\" by the last two Strategic Concepts. Tauscher said that the USG would be addressing some of the issues in developing the Strategic Concept as part of our Nuclear Posture Review. 25. (S/NF) Day said SYG Rasmussen \"must not take his foot off the accelerator of reform.\" The SYG must be a strong leader, needs \"some early wins,\" and must have the kind of access in Washington that former NATO SYG Robertson had, Day said. Defense Trade Treaty -------------------- 26. (S/NF) UK interlocutors sought an update from U/S Tauscher on the status in the Senate of the U.S.-UK Defense Trade Treaty. Tauscher explained that we are working with the Senate to resolve questions concerning implementation. Day emphasized that the Treaty \"matters operationally... this is the sort of stuff that saves lives.\" McDonald stressed that the Treaty was not just an agreement between two leaders, former President Bush and former Prime Minister Blair, \"but an agreement between our two systems.\" McDonald expressed appreciation for Tauscher's affirmation that implementing legislation is not necessary for the Treaty to go into force. Tauscher replied that the purpose of the Treaty was to cut red tape, and we don,t want to put it back in the implementation. Leslie stressed that the UK did not want to \"complicate\" the Administration's efforts to get the Treaty fully ratified. The UK interlocutors expressed appreciation for Tauscher's commitment to the Treaty's ratification and her explanation of the Administration's steps to achieve that goal. Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) --------------------------------------------- -------------- 27. (S/NF) FS Miliband asked for U.S. support for UK candidate John Freeman as Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Director General.

When I first heard about it I was gobsmacked. As a Leith resident, and as someone who also works in Leith, I'm struggling to think what benefit the plant will bring to the environment or indeed the local economy, in either the long term or the short term. I fear for the safety of Leith's residents, for our health and our wellbeing. Air quality – the next big social issue It is estimated that in Scotland up to 10,000 people die prematurely each year from poor air quality related conditions. At the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), they have traditionally focussed most of their resources on water quality. Statistics show that last year no one died of poor water quality in Scotland, which is testament to SEPA's focus and hard work in this area. I want to see SEPA build on this success by changing their focus to air quality, and the proposed Leith biomass plant should be firmly in their sights. Currently, in the new Eastern European member states of the EU, burning waste for energy is common practice. Poor control in defining what is just normal municipal waste, and what is hazardous/biological/chemical waste that needs \"treatment\" at certain temperatures, and after incineration needs disposal \"treatment,\" is of particular concern. From what I understand whilst researching this blog post, this will soon be tightened-up with firmer legislation designed to close those loopholes that are currently open to abuse. My fear is that this will likely lead to the UK importing others' hazardous waste to \"treat it properly\", and that the Leith biomass plant, if it goes ahead, will soon be burning, not just wood, but other countries' hospital waste too. I for one don't want that on my doorstep. There are well known and well documented air quality issues from Sulphur Oxide(s) aka Sox, Nitrogen Oxide(s) aka Nox and Sooty particulates (formerly known as Soot), produced when burning the type of waste mentioned above. The UK, as a heavily urbanised country, suffers from poor inner city air quality, with many urban areas at, or above, the maximum standards being laid down by the EU. Nox and sooty particulates are especially bad in cities because of car and lorry emissions. Sox is mostly from chimney emissions from power plants burning coal. There is a real chance that the UK will shortly face huge EU fines for failing the emissions targets we agreed to. This could potentially run into hundreds of millions of pounds - not very good for our economy. The air quality limits measured in the Leith area are likely to be very conservative estimates and you need to drill into the raw data to see periods when the limits are exceeded (hot, still summer days, etc.). One thing's for sure, adding a massive biomass plant into the mix is not going to improve things one bit. Waste from where? The waste coming into the Leith biomass plant will be shipped in from all over the world. There is no guarantee that the wood used (if it is just wood they will burn, which I for one doubt very much) will come from FSC certified forests. It is likely that the wood will be brought in from clear-cut-forestry in Canada or illegal/unlicensed cutting in the former Soviet Union, and it is worth noting that these northern Boreal forests are considered to be as valuable to us as \"lungs of the earth\" as the Equatorial rain forests are. Shipping in wood to burn will increase emissions from shipping and these will no doubt come under more intense scrutiny for their CO2 emissions from the oil they use, from which they are exempt just now. This is something that is in the pipeline to be a reality at EU, UK and Scottish levels. This would raise the cost of shipping dramatically; making older small inshore vessels, similar to the type that would bring cargo into a small, shallow water port like Leith, totally uneconomical. That would mean that wood would have to be brought in from larger cargo ships that would dock elsewhere, and the wood would have to be brought in by lorry. So Leith would be subject to more road damage, congestion, noise nuisance, poor road safety and of course poor local air quality - things that Leith could do with less of, not more! Contracts, not just promises If building a biomass plant in Leith is to be seen as a green and renewable energy exercise, then there must be contracts in place (not just promises), ensuring that all wood burned here in Leith will be from FSC certified forestry. Otherwise the biomass plant will be a cynical commercial venture, and nothing more. But, even if proper contracts are in place, and everything is above board, I cannot see why Leith is a good place to build a biomass plant. Leith has plenty of electricity and energy, sitting as it does on the edge of the North Sea with its wind, gas, oil and wave power. In addition, Edinburgh is near two coal fired stations and a nuclear power plant, so we're hardly in need of any more power. If like me you think the proposed Leith biomass plant is a really bad idea, then please head over to No Leith Biomass, download your objection letter and send it in before Friday 11 March.

With fears growing that the cost of petrol could hit £2 a litre if instability in the Middle East persists and deepens, every government department will be told this week to comply with a new national \"carbon plan\" aimed specifically at \"getting off the oil hook\". The energy secretary, Chris Huhne, told the Observer that the UK had no option but to speed up efforts to move away from oil. \"Getting off the oil hook is made all the more urgent by the crisis in the Middle East. We cannot afford to go on relying on such a volatile source of energy when we can have clean, green and secure energy from low-carbon sources,\" he said. \"The carbon plan is about ensuring that the whole of government is engaged in a joined-up effort to lead us into a low-carbon world.\" The transport secretary, Philip Hammond, who has infuriated green groups by floating the idea of raising the motorway speed limit from 70mph to 80mph, will be told he must produce a nationwide strategy to promote installation of infrastructure for electric cars by June. It is also expected that new deadlines will be set for building low-carbon homes, and that a firm starting date of September 2012 will be established for a new \"green investment bank\" to become fully operational. The Carbon Plan will be launched this week by David Cameron, his deputy Nick Clegg and Huhne. In a tacit admission that ministers have failed so far to live up to their claim to be part of the \"greenest government ever\", the prime minister will, in effect, make their job security dependent on \"green achievement\" by demanding that those whose departments fall short of environmental targets write to him with a full explanation of what went wrong. And in another extraordinary move, non-governmental organisations, including Greenpeace, will be asked to play a monitoring role to ensure progress across each department is maintained. Sources have told the Observer that Clegg – unhappy that the coalition could not boast more green achievements – had recently chaired meetings with ministers in \"growing frustration that some departments were not taking their green responsibilities seriously enough\". In a speech last week, Huhne warned that China was pouring money into developing a low-carbon economy while Britain lagged behind. \"China will build 24 nuclear power stations in the time it takes us to build one. By 2020, their nuclear capacity will have increased tenfold,\" he said. \"They will lay 16,000km of high-speed rail track in the time it takes us to go from London to Birmingham. \"They have the highest installed hydro-capacity and the most solar water heaters in the world. And they are forging ahead on wind power. So China knows what's coming.\" John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said that despite the initiative, which was welcome, only some in government appeared to understand the need to break free from oil. \"Sadly, over at transport, Philip Hammond is still confused. Cuts to public transport, coupled with his recent proposals to raise the speed limit, appear designed to reduce fuel efficiency and increase our dependence on oil. Huhne really needs to drag Hammond away from Top Gear and force him to spend some time watching the news,\" he said. The sharp rise in oil prices – to a two-and-a-half-year high – has already pushed unleaded fuel above £1.40 a litre in garages in Kent. With the government facing growing calls for action, the chancellor offered his firmest hint yet that he would stop a planned 1p-a-litre rise in fuel duty – due to come into effect next month – in the budget on 23 March. George Osborne told the Conservative spring conference in Cardiff: \"I know how hard the rises in world oil prices are hurting families in Britain. We've got another of the Labour party's preprepared rises in petrol taxes coming this April – one penny above inflation. When it costs £1.30 for a litre of petrol, £80 to fill up a family car, I know people feel squeezed. And I say this to people watching: I hear you.\" In response, Angela Eagle, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that Osborne should act now to answer concerns. \"People want action, not warm words, from George Osborne. He should listen to Labour's campaign and act right now to help millions of families by reversing the Tory VAT rise on petrol, which has added £1.35 to the cost of filling up a 50-litre tank. In the budget, he should look again at the annual duty rise due in April. The last Labour government often postponed planned duty increases when world oil prices were rising, as they are now.\" In his address to the Tory conference today Cameron will strike an optimistic note on the economy, stressing his party's commitment to enterprise. He will say: \"For Conservatives, enterprise is about more than money, more than the economics of growth and GDP. We understand that enterprise is not just about markets – it's about morals too. We understand that enterprise is not just an economic good, it's a social good.\" The Carbon Plan is being published in draft form ahead of a final version in the autumn, and will be updated annually. It will be unveiled as the centrepiece of a week of \"green announcements\" by ministers. The progress made by each department will be published quarterly on the 10 Downing Street website."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-22T19:04:00Z","webTitle":"Lib Dem conference: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dem conference: Politics live blog","bodyText":"Well, I enjoyed that. Nick Clegg, Tim Farron and Jo Swinson can certainly work a crowd, although some of the more minor names on stage tonight were pretty dire. That's it from me for for the day - Andy will be back at the crack of dawn with more tomorrow. Here's an evening summary before I go. • Nick Clegg closed the first day of the Lib Dem conference in Brighton with a challenge to Labour to apologise for its economic policies and \"illegal\" Iraq war, an attack on the Tories for trying to impose a \"turbo-charged rightwing agenda\" on the country, praise for the fact the Olympics showed a Britain at ease with multiculturalism and a number of good jokes at his own expense. Bizarrely, however, party president Tim Farron – who says he hopes to replace Clegg one day – appeared not to have been briefed on his party leader's speech in advance. His own speech, made before Clegg's, joked that lines about the Olympics would become a \"tedious\" cliche of conference season, and asked Labour to apologise for its economic policies and the Iraq war, forcing Clegg to add the line \"but Tim is right\" to his own remarks. • Clegg said the Lib Dems were going to \"hold [their] nerve\" and press on with their five-year programme. Clegg's personal ratings, and the party's as a whole, are very poor, but as the conference starts Clegg has been stressing his determination to fight the next election as Lib Dem leader and there seems to be no serious effort to unseat him. Farron called him an outstanding leader and the party has been stressing its success in forcing the coalition to raise the tax allowance, taking low-earners out of tax. \"Fairer tax in tough times\" is the conference theme. • Clegg's speech announced that Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is now in charge of the review into the replacement of Trident. Alexander has been sceptical about the need for and the cost of Trident before. • David Laws, the education minister, has announced that £100m will be spent continuing a summer school programme for pupils from disadvantaged homes for another two years. The original scheme was announced by Nick Clegg last year. Laws made the announcement in his conference speech. All too often pupils who have made big progress through the school year fall behind over the long summer holiday, particularly if they are changing schools. Over 2,000 secondary schools took part in that programme this summer and the feedback we received was fantastic, so I am announcing today that we are allocating a further £100 million to continue this project in 2013 and 2014. • The Lib Dem conference passed a motion instructing MPs to vote against the proposed boundary changes because of the failure of the Conservatives to support Lords reform. Clegg said during the summer that the Lib Dems would not vote for the boundary changes that would help the Tories at the next election, but there has been speculation that he could be persuaded to change his mind. Blocking the boundary changes is now official party policy, and Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip, told the conference his MPs would not vote for them. The Lib Dems have also agreed that future Lib Dem peers will have to sign a declaration saying they support Lords reform before they can go to the Lords. • The iTunes single mocking Nick Clegg's apology over tuition fees has now made the top 40. \"To those of you who have seen the video,\" Clegg told the conference, \"I say this: I really am so, so sorry.\" He ends by telling the Lib Dems to \"go out and show the country what we're made of\". They love that and he gets a standing ovation. And this isn't even his main conference speech ... He then hits them with his serious attack on the Tories: My message to those Conservative backbench MPs who seem to think they have the right to force a turbo-charged right wing agenda on our country is this: You didn’t win the last election. You do not have a majority. The British people have not given you the right to act like you do. We formed this coalition in good faith and for the good of the country at a time of crisis. That required compromise on both sides. Liberal Democrats have kept our side of the bargain. You must too. Clegg handles the fact that Tim has stolen his preroration pretty well. He adds in the emphatic line: \"But Tim is RIGHT!\" before asking for his apologies. If the crowd notice anything's gone wrong, they don't seem to mind. There are some pretty big things I think people would like to hear them apologise for. How about a personal apology from you Ed Balls for nearly bankrupting the country after you went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive in the City of London to let the banks off the hook? And how about, Ed Miliband, an apology, on behalf of your party, for dragging our country into an unjust and illegal war in Iraq? Clegg than sets up quite a good joke. He says \"the Conservatives - they're not all bad, you know...\" \"Really?\" asks a polite heckler. \"Peter Bone - I borrowed his satnav. But it kept on telling me to turn right ... Come on, I expected a better laugh than that. I'm sorry. I tried to tell a joke that I couldn't deliver.\" That's pretty good! He attacks Labour as \"divided, deluded, with no sense of direction\". Come on. That's unfair. They're not particularly divided. Clegg makes his references to Ennis and Farah. He means well, but I would suggest drawing attention to their racial origins in this way makes the exact opposite point to the one he wants to make, by marking the two athletes out as different. Here's exactly what he says: Just look at the qualities we displayed as a country this summer: unity; generosity; diversity; openness; community; fair play. Look at the heroes we celebrated: Jessica Ennis – a mixed race woman from Sheffield who conquered the world with grace and humility. What a role model she is. And Mo Farah – what a wonderful thing it says about us as a country that we have taken an immigrant called Mohammed to our hearts. At a press conference Mo Farah was asked whether he would have preferred to run for Somalia. He said ‘Listen mate, this is my country’. And in a single sentence every argument the BNP and the EDL have ever put forward was crushed. This is his country. This is all of our country. Farron returns. He pays tribute to Clegg for his apology for tuition fees, then asks Labour to apologise for its City policy and the \"illegal\" Iraq war - stealing all Clegg's upcoming lines. Clegg comes on stage and the two hug in an awkward grapple. Clegg opens by informing the conference the remix of his apology is at No 37 in the iTunes chart. \"To those of you who have seen the video, I say this: I really am so, so sorry.\" Equalities minister Jo Swinson speaks next. She says the Lib Dem conference has a \"psephologists anonymous\" feel to it - seemingly starting off with the Stewart Lee approach of insulting your audience. She's probably right, though; I witnessed Jeremy Browne, the Home Office minister, lovingly reel off the years of the last 10 or 20 general elections one at a time to make a point earlier. A mention of Sarah Teather - recently and surprisingly sacked from the frontbench - gets a big round of applause from the audience. Swinson goes on to mock the Lib Dems' typical election leaflets, including the notoriously misleading \"two-horse race\" bar charts they so often favour. She recalls the difficulties of electiontioneering in the era of \"a conspiracy to murder charge against the party leader - could be worse … \" It's a likeable speech. Simon Hughes is up next, after Farron showers him with praise, including that some of his constituents think he is an MP for Labour, rather than the Lib Dems, so therefore, Farron says, he \"transcends politics\" in his community. That's one way of looking at it. Luckily Hughes attacks Labour for its backing of nuclear power, its \"authoritarianism\" and its lack of commitment to green issues. The environment is \"much more safe in our hands\", Hughes says. He suggests that if you don't believe in the government's \"green deal\", you go out on to the streets of Brighton and ask some young people if they'd like a \"green deal - and you don't have to pay anything up front. I think it would be quite popular,\" he jokes. He ends his speech on a particularly anti-Tory note, holding up an anti-George Osborne poster that Greenpeace have made. Farron is back. He says he's just heard the news that George Osborne does have a plan B. It's exactly the same as plan A, he says, except Michael Gove has marked him down a grade mid-term. The embargo has been lifted on Clegg's speech. As well as paying tribute to Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah and what the British embrace of these athletes says about how comfortable the UK is with multiculturalism, he is going to announce that Danny Alexander is now in charge of the review into the replacement of Trident. Alexander has been sceptical about the need and the cost of Trident before. Referring to his own now-infamous tuition fees apology, Clegg is going to ask Labour to apologise for their policies towards the City and the \"illegal\" Iraq war. And he will tell the Tories they don't have the right to force a \"turbo-charged right wing agenda\" on the British public. Tim Farron takes the stage, calling this rally the \"opening ceremony\" of the conference season. He says mentioning the Olympics in a conference speech is going to be one of the most \"tedious\" conference staples this year - but he's going to do it anyway. (So is Nick Clegg, by the way - I've read his speech. Presumably Farron has read it too.) Clegg and co have just taken their places at the front of the hall to the sight of flashbulbs popping from the dozen or so photographers in front of the stage. The hall at the Brighton Centre seems more or less full up to me, alhough the highest section of seating is curtained off. Hi, Paul Owen here. I'll be your host for the next hour or two as the Lib Dems hold their opening rally, with the reasonably star-studded line-up of Nick Clegg, his possible future leadership rival Tim Farron, deputy leader Simon Hughes, who was at one point seen as the voice of the Lib Dem left, and equalities minister Jo Swinson, a popular conference turn. Lib Dems are often in a better mood than outsiders might expect at their annual conference. Today the atmosphere is particularly buoyant - far from being crushed by the responsibilities of government, as their leader sometimes seems, the delegates seem excited to be in likeminded company and enjoying the sun and the sea air. • Nick Clegg has arrived in Brighton for the opening of the Lib Dem conference saying the Lib Dems are going to \"hold [their] nerve\" and press on with their five-year programme. Clegg's personal ratings, and the party's as a whole, are very poor, but as the conference starts Clegg has been stressing his determination to fight the next election as Lib Dem leader and there seems to be no serious effort to unseat him. Tim Farron, one of his rivals, has called him an outstanding leader and the party has been stressing its success in forcing the coalition to raise the tax allowance, taking low-earners out of tax. \"Fairer tax in tough times\" is the conference theme. • David Laws, the education minister, has announced that £100m will be spent continuing a summer school programme for pupils from disadvantaged homes for another two years. The original scheme was announced by Nick Clegg last year. Laws made the announcement in his conference speech. All too often pupils who have made big progress through the school year fall behind over the long summer holiday, particularly if they are changing schools. Over 2,000 secondary schools took part in that programme this summer and the feedback we received was fantastic, so I am announcing today that we are allocating a further £100 million to continue this project in 2013 and 2014. • The Lib Dem conference has passed a motion instructing MPs to vote against the proposed boundary changes because of the failure of the Conservatives to support Lords reform. Nick Clegg said during the summer that the Lib Dems would not vote for the boundary changes that would help the Tories at the next election, but there has been speculation that he could be persuaded to change his mind. Blocking the boundary changes is now official party policy, and Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip, told the conference his MPs would not vote for them. The Lib Dems have also agreed that future Lib Dem peers will have to sign a declaration saying they support Lords reform before they can go to the Lords. • The iTunes single mocking Nick Clegg's apology over tuition fees has now made the top 40. That's it from me for tonight. But my colleague Paul Owen will carry on blogging. He will be writing everything from now on and he will be covering the Lib Dem rally at 6.30pm, where Clegg, Farron and Simon Hughes will be speaking The Lords debate, and the afternoon session of the conference, is now over. The Lords motion, says the Lib Dems should not approve the proposed boundary changes, was approved. I will post a summary shortly. Lord Newby, a Lib Dem whip in the Lords, told the conference that in future people being made Lib Dem peers would have to sign a declaration saying they were in favour of Lords reform. This is an issue for the party because some Lib Dems peers are opposed to having an elected Lords, even though this is a firm plank of party policy. Here's more from Alistair Carmichael. Resisting progressive change is what the Conservatives do. The Conservatives - the clue is in the title. If the conduct of the Conservatives was a disappointment, then the conduct of the Labour party was a disgrace. It's quite something when you see the trade unions standing shoulder to shoulder with the hereditary barons. Their opposition to change wasn't based on principle or belief, but sheer partisanship and narrow party interest. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip (and government deputy chief whip), has come out with the best line of the day, in the debate on Lords reform. Quoting the Clash, he told the conference: \"I fought the Lords, but the Lords won.\" The Lib Dem schools motion being debated this afternoon would have been reasonably significant, because it called for pupils leaving primary school to be tested through internal procedures - which would have meant the abolition of Sats at key stage two. But, after a close vote, the motion was amended to say that external testing should stay when pupils leave primary school. The motion was then approved. So, an attempt by the party leadership to call for the abolition of Sats at key stage two was defeated. As a result of another amendment, the motion also says councils should have a scrutiny role over academies. And we know how many people are here. Some 207 people took part in the vote. Kevin Brennan, the Labour schools spokesman, has been following the Lib Dem conference. He has posted this on Twitter. According to PoliticsHome, Danny Alexander has said that having a minister in the Department for the Environment (where David Heath has just become farming minister) was more important for the party than having one in the Foreign Office or at Defence. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, thinks that Clegg is an \"outstanding\" leader and that he has \"nothing to worry about\" in relation to the security of his position. Here's the video of him saying so. The Lib Dems have got their own conference app. The Lib Dems are now debating a motion on school. But one activist has complained that there is no opportunity to vote against Michael Gove's Ebacc proposal, and there was a mini procedural debate on changing standing orders to allow the debate to be extended. The proposals was voted down, and they are back to the debate as scheduled. Leading Lib Dem frontbenchers are running \"ministerial surgeries\" with delegates throughout this year's conference. Paul Owen has just been to see Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, talk about the economy. Delegates asked technical and often rather ponderous questions about compliance with the tax code, small business rates, the road fund licence tax disc, and so on. Alexander seemed unflappable and relaxed; earlier in the lobby of the Grand Hotel I overheard him telling a bearded antagonist affably: \"What else could we do, mate?\" Alexander's most interesting answer this afternoon was probably his suggestion that parts of Iain Duncan Smith's incoming universal credit system may be altered if they do not work. He was asked about the introduction of monthly rather than weekly or fortnightly benefit payments, and replied: \"Your specific point about paying weekly or paying monthly, and also I think a related point which is paying benefit directly to individuals rather than paying it directly to councils … CLG [the Department for Communities and Local Government] are piloting that at the moment to see whether the fears that people have, the fear is that a lot of people will then default on their rental payment and that will cause financial problem for councils and for housing association, to see if that is borne out by experience. \"Clearly if it is borne out then we need to think again about the policy, in terms of how those benefits are paid.\" But he added that: \"There is part of this which is about trying to encourage people to take more financial responsibility by receiving the money themselves and then paying it out, which of course is what everybody else has to do. But I do accept that if these pilots show up the sort of problems that we're being warned about then we clearly have to look very carefully at that.\" Patrick Kingsley has sent me an email saying he has found some Clegg \"sorry\" badges on sale. He has posted about it on Twitter. The Lib Dems have passed their early years motion, with two amendments. It calls for an independent report into making childcare provision more flexible and for a study into the feasibility of wrapping the various childcare support payments into one payment. It also calls for a study of EU practice into how good childcare could be delivered more cheaply, perhaps by increasing child/adult ratios. There was some opposition to this, but Annette Brooke, the MP summing up, said the Lib Dems were only calling for a study; they were not calling for ratios to be changed. Elizabeth Truss, the Tory MP who has just been made an education minister, published a report earlier this year saying childminders should be allowed to look after more children, so that childcare can become more affordable. Nick Thornsby has a good summary of the Laws speech at Lib Dem Voice. The Press Association has filed a story about the surprise success of the Clegg apology in the iTunes chart. Here it is. After two years of languishing in the political polls the Liberal Democrat leader is today enjoying some popularity - at least in the Apple iTunes chart. The spoof song, which uses Clegg's two-and-a-half-minute video apology over his party's pledge on tuition fees, went to number 39 in the iTunes chart, just a little more than 12 hours after its release. It is unclear whether Clegg, thought to be the first member of the cabinet to have enjoyed a chart career while still holding a day job, will manage to outperform pop rivals such as The Script and Little Mix in the sales tally. But he has already seen off stiff competition from Kanye West and is hot on Pink's heels. Nick Clegg Says I'm Sorry (The Autotune Remix) song initially entered the Apple iTunes chart at 116, but sales quickly soared. The spoof was created by satirical website http://www.thepoke.co.uk. A spokesman for the website said: \"Nick Clegg has been very good-humoured about this. \"He has become the first politician in history to achieve a position in the pop charts for making an apology. \"The Poke is staggered by its success.\" Clegg gave permission for the single to be released and all profits will be given to Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, of which his wife Miriam is a patron. Temulakar in the comments wants to know how many people are here. In the hall at the moment, 200 or 300, I think. It feels about half full. It's a respectable audience for Saturday afternoon on a sunny day, but the Lib Dems clearly aren't expecting an enormous crowd. The balcony seats in the Brighton centre have all been curtained off, and the platform has been brought forward by about 20 yards, with the rest of the hall screened off behind it, so that the conference hall feels smaller than it would be if all the space were being used. Here's some Twitter reaction to the Laws speech. From the Mail's Matt Chorley From Sean Davey, a Lib Dem activist From Kevin McNamara, who posts as WoollyMindedLib Laws also accepts that the pupil premium needs to be spent more effectively in some schools. He urges Lib Dem members who are involved with schools to ask questions about this. Laws announces that the government will spend another £100m to continue the summer school programme for disadvantaged pupils that was announced by Nick Clegg last year. Some 2,000 schools took part this year, he says. The new money will fund the programme in 2013 and 2014. David Laws, the education minister, is speaking now. He starts by saying that he knows some in the party see him as a \"number-crunching, dessicated calculating machine\" (using the phrase that Aneurin Bevan used about Gaitskell). And he pays tribute to the work of his predecessor, Sarah Teather, praising her for focusing on special educational needs. (See published a green paper on the subject.) And here's the Guardian video of Clegg arriving at the conference earlier. You can follow the key conference announcments on the Lib Dem confererence Twitter feed. Paul Owen reports from the first fringe of the day, which was packed out with Lib Dem delegates wanting to hear Tim Farron - the folksy Lib Dem president who recently mused that he might like to be leader some day. That was mischievous, and the fact Farron is running for president again means lots of his supporters are walking around wearing orange badges that say \"I'm for Tim\", which Nick Clegg is probably not 100% delighted about either. Farron was on a panel, along with his colleague new Home Office minister Jeremy Browne and assorted thinktankers, discussing how to \"renew\" the coalition. He suggested that it had been better to open what he predicted would be a modern era of coalitions with a Tory-Lib Dem team-up rather than a coalition with Labour. The \"love-in\" between then-leader Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair in the 1990s had threatened Lib Dem \"assimilation\", he said. With this coalition, by contrast, \"you would have to be absolutely crackers to think that the Lib Dems and the Tories are in some sort of love-in - this is a business relationship.\" His party, he said, now had to be \"distinctive, but not destructive\". This summer had seen \"the death of the Cameron project\", and the Tories were now going to go off to their \"extreme\" - \"we mustn't do the same with ours\". The Lib Dems must be \"radicals, absolutely - but not lunatics,\" he added prudently. He said the Lib Dems would look \"ludicrous\" if they withdrew early from the coalition. Browne suggested it was a \"complete delusion\" to suggest that if they left the coalition \"say, at the autumn 2014 conference\" the electorate would then forget the Liberals had been part of the government. Farron also tried to explain grassroots anger about the party breaking its pledge not to increase tuition fees, saying: \"We delivered, in their eyes, lots of nice stuff they didn't mind, but we didn't deliver what they really wanted.\" But he was less understanding about what he called the \"Polly Toynbee attitude\" towards the coalition, which he said was \"psychopathic\". Browne said that he had recently asked John Major how the coalition was going, and the former Tory PM who presided over nightmarish party splits over Europe had told him: \"Jeremy, it's far more stable than the coalition I led when I was prime minister.\" Councillor David Tutt, leader of the Lib Dem group on East Sussex county council, opened the conference with a short speech. He said that being in coalition with the Tories did not mean that you had to like them and he said that he had concerns about the proposed welfare cuts. He also had a dig at the press, accusing us of always predicting the demise of the liberals. This is what Nick Clegg said when he arrived in Brighton earlier. It is a tough time economically for the country and it has been a challenging time for the Liberal Democrats politically. But I don't want anyone to be in any doubt: the Liberal Democrats are going to hold our nerve and see this through. We are halfway through a five-year journey and we are doing some very important things: rescuing and reforming and repairing the British economy; delivering fairer taxes in tough times and improving schools for children up and down the country. Those are things we are very proud of. Clegg made this point rather more vividly in his FT interview. What you don’t do is bale out half way up the mountain. But that's a mixed metaphor, isn't it? I thought you could only bale out from a plane. If Nick Clegg does not fancy writing or working for Greenpeace when he leaves politics (see 1.57pm), there's always a career in music. This is the latest from The Poke Here we go again. It's a glorious day by the sea, but us drone workers of the political media class are encased in the Brighton centre waiting for the Lib Dem conference – and indeed, the entire three-week festival of politicking that makes up the British conference season – to get underway. I'm sure that that we are going to have some exciting and dramatic moments, but perhaps not this afternoon. Senior Lib Dem figures have been giving interviews to mark the opening of the conference. • Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has told the Guardian that Tories in the government are waging a “constant war of attrition” on green issues. • David Laws, the education minister, has told the Times (paywall) that the Lib Dems will not agree spending plans with the Tories beyond 2015-16 in the next spending review. • Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, has told the Daily Telegraph that the Lib Dems will not agree to further welfare cuts unless new taxes are introduced for the wealthy. There has also been an announcement from Laws that the pupil premium will go up, prompting the first Lib Dem complaint about the Guardian of the conference. There are bound to be more. It's a tradition. But perhaps the most interesting read is in the Financial Times, where George Parker has written a long interview/profile about Clegg. He has written a story off the back of it about Clegg saying welfare cuts would have to be matched by extra taxes for the rich – “The idea that all savings are done through a £10bn slug from welfare is for the birds,” says Clegg – but the bulk of the profile is about how Clegg has no intention of quitting and how he thinks he is maturing as a leader. Clegg says he is determined to fight the next election and Parker says Clegg's wife Miriam has decided she does not want to move back to Brussels because she now regards it as rather provincial. Clegg's friends tell Parker that Clegg may stand down as leader at some point in the next parliament (and after that Clegg's mother thinks Clegg may turn to writing, or work for Greenpeace or Amnesty, Parker reports). Parker also quotes Clegg talking about how he has changed. I have more energy and more clarity about what we need to do in the second half of the parliament than I did in the early stages of this government ... Clearly something I have learned – like no other Liberal Democrat leader has done – is how to both fight and win bare-knuckle fights in government ... I will be a different leader in 2015, I’m already a different leader. I have learned a lot of things. So, the Lib Dems will have a different leader in 2015! George, you missed the scoop.

This series finds the green-fingered sometime novelist visiting inspirational British gardens of history, this time fetching up in the 17th-century elegance of Hatfield House in Hertfordshire. Here, the meticulous order of the knot garden can be seen giving way to the more colourful and eclectic parterre, the decorative and the practical – even the political – going hand in hand. Alan attempts to make this relevant to our own gardens by making something out of wire which looks, in fairness, very bad. JR Kirstie's Homemade Home 8pm, Channel 4 Kirstie's \"secondhand revolution\" involves people buying old stuff, giving it a good scrub-up and putting it in their homes, except here it's a lifestyle choice rather than a necessity. Now that she's done her own house, Kirstie is passing on her expertise to others; this week, she's helping a couple bring Caribbean flavour to their pad with the help of some homemade appliqué cushions. It's all very wholesome, in a crafty kind of way. RN BP: $30bn Blowout – A Money Programme Special 9pm, BBC2 Tony Hayward, BP's former chief executive, speaks for the first time about what it was like to be running the multinational during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It's something of an understatement to say it was a challenge: as well as the technical difficulties of stopping the oil pouring out into the Gulf of Mexico, he had to deal with President Obama, BP's shareholders and the world's media. RV The Secret Life Of The National Grid 9pm, BBC4 After the white heat of technology, the meltdown. The final programme in the series explores the downside of having a centralised electricity system – ie being held to ransom by those with the power to pull the plug. Plunging Britain into darkness, while humiliating the Tories in the early 1970s, clearly wasn't something Margaret Thatcher was prepared to forget or forgive during the following decade. Plus, there's a look at how the UK's love affair with nuclear power fizzled out and what the future may hold in store. AJC Getting On 10pm, BBC4 On what should be a dull nightshift, nurse Kim Wilde plays solitaire on the computer. Bliss. Except Kim's hopes of a quiet night prove to be forlorn when, first, she's left alone on the ward because the night sister leaves early, and then B4 welcomes an emergency admission whose condition is unusual enough to attract the attentions of ambitious Dr Moore. If this weren't difficult enough, Kim also has to contend with a tired and emotional Den (teary phone message to Hilary: \"Maybe we could try for a baby . . .\"). Controlled mayhem, beautifully anchored by deadpan Jo Brand's comic timing. JW Community 10pm, Viva Who would have thought that Pete Campbell's wife could be so funny? Alison Brie – Mad Men's Trudy – playing prim, uptight, formerly prescription drug-addled Annie Edison is one of the best things about this great new comedy. Tonight she's left in charge of Greendale College's STD Awareness Ball. And proud of it, too: \"I was voted most likely to succeed at my rehab clinic!\" she squeals. It's all going very well until someone questions the wisdom of stitching the college's name on the complimentary condoms.

They will ring down the curtain and join the choir invisible. I may be exaggerating, but only slightly. On Thursday morning, polling company YouGov had Lib Dem support at single figures (9%) for the first time since 1997. It's at 11% today (both within the polling margin of error) but the trend since May's election has been steadily downwards. If Labour or the Conservatives had shed half their support in a manner of months, people would be at panic stations. But Lib Dems exude a Zen-like stillness. And there are several misplaced reasons for this. Some Lib Dems point to other pollsters who show higher support. But that's mostly down to different methodology, with some companies also counting \"don't know\" voters and spreading them out. See this explanation. The polling methods might be different but they all show a downward trend for Lib Dems since May. Others argue this always happens to the party between elections. But this is usually because they get little media coverage. That isn't the case this year and Nick Clegg is now a household name, as he wasn't before. Yet their support keeps falling. I suspect there is a deeper issue here, and Tony Blair comes to mind by way of comparison. Blair hated the left because he felt they made Labour unelectable. Denying them a seat at the top table is one thing, but he also went out of his way to ignore and rubbish them. He was unapologetic about Iraq, paid little to attention the party's shrinking base and cared even less for signature leftwing issues. Gordon Brown carried on the tradition and ignored millions of low-income voters who had abandoned the party since 1997. We were all middle class now, the thinking went, and only voters in the centre mattered. It was only after May that Labour MPs admitted they should have done much more. Clegg seems to be on the same trajectory. The left of the Lib Dems are increasingly dismissed as woolly idealists who don't understand the pragmatic needs of wielding power. The two leaders make the same calculation: their base has nowhere else to go and those angry voters will come back. But this calculation fundamentally misunderstands leftwing voters, as Labour eventually realised to its cost. Voters who felt angry and disenchanted didn't come back, they simply sat at home during the election. They became disengaged. Lib Dems already attract a good percentage of voters disenchanted with other parties for \"selling out\". How do you think they will feel in watching such blatant U-turns over VAT, tuition fees, nuclear power, housing and more? To compound that problem, Ed Miliband is planning to aggressively go for those disenchanted voters. He launched his campaign accepting that Labour got it wrong over ID cards and 42-day detention. He has since said he is open to Lib Dem ideas on prison reform, raising the tax threshold and going further on tackling climate change. There's something wrong when even Tories wonder why Lib Dem left leaders are so quiet. It's time for them to wake up and start making their case, or Thatcher's parody may actually become reality in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/28/lake-district-burial-nuclear-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-28T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"Lake District identified as prime site for burial of nuclear waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/28/lake-district-burial-nuclear-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/28/lake-district-burial-nuclear-waste","fields":{"headline":"Lake District identified as prime site for burial of nuclear waste","bodyText":"It is not clear what Wordsworth would have made of it, but the \"bliss and solitude\" of the Lake District that inspired the poet's verse has now made it the UK's leading contender for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. A report prepared for the government by the British Geological Survey (BGS) looked at the geological suitability of areas within Cumbria. The report will not in itself determine where a long-term nuclear dump will be sited, but it rules out much of the county outside the Lake District National Park as being unsuitable geologically. Finding a safe disposal method for the UK's nuclear waste has been a thorny issue for several decades. In 2006, the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management published recommendations on long-term disposal, saying it would be best carried out by identifying suitable sites for burial. The idea behind \"deep geological disposal\" is to store radioactive waste from nuclear power stations and military establishments within suitable rock formations so that it remains safe for thousands of years. The UK government is pursuing this strategy and similar geological disposal plans are being made in Finland, Sweden and the US. In 2008, the government called for communities interested in hosting such geological storage facilities to come forward for further evaluations. So far three local authorities in Cumbria – Allerdale Borough Council, Copeland Borough Council and Cumbria County Council – have shown an interest. To rule out unsuitable locations, the BGS was asked to examine the known geological features of the areas. Cumbria already hosts the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. Areas with natural resources such as coal or iron ores at depths greater than 100 metres were screened out, as were places with exploitable groundwater resources in aquifers, because of the risk of radioactive contamination. On this basis the BGS ruled that areas in north-west and south-west Cumbria were unsuitable. The BGS report is only the start of the process of choosing suitable sites. \"This work does not show where a facility might eventually be located,\" the authors write. \"It is at an early stage in the site selection process and simply intends to avoid unnecessary work in areas which are clearly unsuitable for obvious geological reasons. A more rigorous assessment, based on a comprehensive range of criteria, will only be undertaken if a 'decision to participate' in further stages of site selection process is taken.\" Energy minister Charles Hendry said: \"We must progress implementation of geological disposal, the long-term sustainable solution for dealing with radioactive waste.\" He added: \"The geological disposal facility site selection process is based on voluntarism and partnership and these results do not present any reason why West Cumbria cannot continue to consider whether or not to participate in that process.\" Ben Ayliffe, senior energy campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \"It's hard to imagine a more tragic legacy to Britain's nuclear folly than vats of lethal nuclear waste being stored around Keswick or Scafell Pike ... Dumping this stuff underground is no solution anyway – wherever it is. So we certainly shouldn't be creating any more nuclear waste. There are much better ways of producing electricity.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/feb/09/gas-prices-rising-costs-down-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-09T18:00:00Z","webTitle":"Gas prices will keep going up, but there are ways to keep the costs down | Sam Laidlaw","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/gas-prices-rising-costs-down-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/gas-prices-rising-costs-down-uk","fields":{"headline":"Gas prices will keep going up, but there are ways to keep the costs down","bodyText":"With tensions rising in Egypt and throughout the Middle East, the price of oil this week broke through $100 a barrel, its highest level for nearly two years. It's a development that has already raised concerns about the impact on global economic recovery. But beyond these regional geopolitical influences, commodity prices are rising across the globe. Everything, from food to raw materials, appears to be on an inflationary path. Gas is no exception. Wholesale prices on the UK spot market doubled from 30p a therm in March 2010 to 60p by December. Forward prices for 2011 rose by nearly 50% over the same period. This dramatic shift triggered the recent increase in domestic UK energy prices. To some observers, this upward move is perplexing, as they read about the prolific discoveries of shale gas in the US. It has been hailed as a long-term \"game changer\", which could trigger a global gas glut. Shale has certainly revolutionised the US market, releasing vast, and hitherto uneconomic reserves. It now accounts for 20% of production there, up from just 5% in 2006. As a result, the price of natural gas in the US has fallen by 40% over the last three years. At times this month it has traded at half the cost of gas in the UK. But there are strong reasons for seeing the shale gas phenomenon as largely confined to the US, at least for some time. Although the existence of gas-bearing shales in the States has been known about for decades, its potential has only recently been unlocked through a combination of access to acreage, incentives for owners and exploration companies, and the existence of a well-developed supply chain. These conditions are unlikely to be replicated elsewhere. Even in the US, while technology is lowering the cost of shale gas extraction in some basins, other wells are rapidly depleting and the cost structure and environmental charges are rising. The impact of shale on world markets will be very limited in the short to medium term. With a well-supplied North American market and low natural gas prices there, US imports of LNG (liquefied natural gas) have dried to a trickle. Ninety per cent of the country's import capacity is lying idle. So the obvious question arises: if the US no longer needs large volumes of LNG imports, will this gas flood on to world markets, leading to oversupply and falling prices elsewhere? The answer is that, while the supply overhang may exert some short-term downward pressure, the long-term trend remains inexorably upwards. Among the consuming countries, Asian gas demand grew at more than 10% last year, supporting the rise in wholesale prices. Barring a significant recession in the region, Asia's demand for LNG will continue to increase. In developed economies, switching from coal to gas power generation is a cost-effective method of achieving emission reduction targets. Coal-fired power stations need replacing as soon as possible; old nuclear plants will start to shut down in five years' time. This too will increase demand for gas, causing wholesale prices to rise, and further upward pressure on household bills. Of course, there's always a degree of uncertainty in predicting the direction of wholesale gas prices. A mere 1% change in global demand can shift the market from oversupply to shortage. But there's no uncertainty about the range of other costs which together make up about half the average domestic energy bill in the UK. So-called \"non-commodity\" charges rose by nearly 9% last year and will continue to increase well into the future, largely as a result of sensible government policies to make sure we have a sustainable energy market in the decades to come. These costs include charges for the transmission of gas and electricity, the installation of smart meters in every UK home, huge investment in low-carbon power generation, and big energy efficiency programmes. The government estimates that the UK needs to invest a total of £200bn by 2020 to decarbonise its power industry and ensure that the lights stay on. But it's not all gloom. Britain has an opportunity – unrivalled in the developed world – to revolutionise the energy efficiency of its aged and inefficient housing stock, ensuring that higher prices do not necessarily result in higher bills. We are fortunate in having North Sea gas – declining but still important – to meet some of our needs, as well as a range of import options through various pipelines and cargoes of LNG. Already, Qatar has invested heavily in building import facilities at Milford Haven and, during another very cold winter, LNG imports have met one fifth of total UK demand. New long-term supply contracts would underpin that investment. But that in itself is not enough. Gas is only part of the energy security solution. We also need prompt action on the pricing of carbon and reform of the electricity market currently being undertaken by the government, so that new nuclear power stations and low-carbon sources of energy can be developed as soon as possible. Otherwise we could find ourselves facing a very different future, one that would threaten our long-term energy security."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/may/02/environmental-fixes-all-greens-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-02T18:30:00Z","webTitle":"Let's face it: none of our environmental fixes break the planet-wrecking project | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/02/environmental-fixes-all-greens-lost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/may/02/environmental-fixes-all-greens-lost","fields":{"headline":"Let's face it: none of our environmental fixes break the planet-wrecking project","bodyText":"You think you're discussing technologies, and you quickly discover that you're discussing belief systems. The battle among environmentalists over how or whether our future energy is supplied is a cipher for something much bigger: who we are, who we want to be, how we want society to evolve. Beside these concerns, technical matters – parts per million, costs per megawatt hour, cancers per sievert – carry little weight. We choose our technology – or absence of technology – according to a set of deep beliefs: beliefs that in some cases remain unexamined. The case against abandoning nuclear power, for example, is a simple one: it will be replaced either by fossil fuels or by renewables that would otherwise have replaced fossil fuels. In either circumstance, greenhouse gases, other forms of destruction and human deaths and injuries all rise. The case against reducing electricity supplies is just as clear. For example, the Zero Carbon Britain report published by the Centre for Alternative Technology urges a 55% cut in overall energy demand by 2030 – a goal I strongly support. It also envisages a near-doubling of electricity production. The reason is that the most viable means of decarbonising both transport and heating is to replace the fuels they use with low-carbon electricity. Cut the electricity supply and we're stuck with oil and gas. If we close down nuclear plants, we must accept an even greater expansion of renewables than currently proposed. Given the tremendous public resistance to even a modest increase in windfarms and new power lines, that's going to be tough. What the nuclear question does is to concentrate the mind about the electricity question. Decarbonising the economy involves an increase in infrastructure. Infrastructure is ugly, destructive and controlled by remote governments and corporations. These questions are so divisive because the same world-view tells us that we must reduce emissions, defend our landscapes and resist both the state and big business. The four objectives are at odds. But even if we can accept an expansion of infrastructure, the technocentric, carbon-counting vision I've favoured runs into trouble. The problem is that it seeks to accommodate a system that cannot be accommodated: a system that demands perpetual economic growth. We could, as Zero Carbon Britain envisages, become carbon-free by 2030. Growth then ensures that we have to address the problem all over again by 2050, 2070 and thereon after. Accommodation makes sense only if the economy is reaching a steady state. But the clearer the vision becomes, the further away it seems. A steady state economy will be politically possible only if we can be persuaded to stop grabbing. This in turn will be feasible only if we feel more secure. But the global race to the bottom and its destruction of pensions, welfare, public services and stable employment make people less secure, encouraging us to grasp as much for ourselves as we can. If this vision looks implausible, consider the alternatives. In the latest edition of his excellent magazine The Land, Simon Fairlie responds furiously to my suggestion that we should take industry into account when choosing our energy sources. His article exposes a remarkable but seldom noticed problem: that most of those who advocate an off-grid, land-based economy have made no provision for manufactures. I'm not talking about the pointless rubbish in the FT's How To Spend It supplement. I'm talking about the energy required to make bricks, glass, metal tools and utensils, textiles (except the hand-loomed tweed Fairlie suggests we wear), ceramics and soap: commodities that almost everyone sees as the barest possible requirements. Are people like Fairlie really proposing that we do without them altogether? If not, what energy sources do they suggest we use? Charcoal would once again throw industry into direct competition with agriculture, spreading starvation and ensuring that manufactured products became the preserve of the very rich. (Remember, as EA Wrigley points out, that half the land surface of Britain could produce enough charcoal to make 1.25m tonnes of bar iron – a fraction of current demand – and nothing else.) An honest environmentalism needs to explain which products should continue to be manufactured and which should not, and what the energy sources for these manufactures should be. There's a still bigger problem here: even if we make provision for some manufacturing but, like Fairlie, envisage a massive downsizing and a return to a land-based economy, how do we take people with us? Where is the public appetite for this transition? A third group tries to avoid such conflicts by predicting that the problem will be solved by collapse: doom is our salvation. Economic collapse, these people argue, is imminent and expiatory. I believe this is wrong on both counts. Last week something astonishing happened: Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency, revealed that peak oil has already happened. \"We think that the crude oil production has already peaked, in 2006.\" If this is true, we should be extremely angry with the IEA. In 2005 its executive director mocked those who predicted peak oil as \"doomsayers\". Until 2008 (two years after the IEA now says it happened) the agency continued to dismiss the possibility that peak oil would occur. But this also raises an awkward question for us greens: why hasn't the global economy collapsed as we predicted? Yes, it wobbled, though largely for other reasons. Now global growth is back with a vengeance: it reached 4.6% last year, and the IMF predicts roughly the same for 2011 and 2012. The reason, as Birol went on to explain, is that natural gas liquids and tar sands are already filling the gap. Not only does the economy appear to be more resistant to resource shocks than we assumed, but the result of those shocks is an increase, not a decline, in environmental destruction. The problem we face is not that we have too little fossil fuel, but too much. As oil declines, economies will switch to tar sands, shale gas and coal; as accessible coal declines, they'll switch to ultra-deep reserves (using underground gasification to exploit them) and methane clathrates. The same probably applies to almost all minerals: we will find them, but exploiting them will mean trashing an ever greater proportion of the world's surface. We have enough non-renewable resources of all kinds to complete our wreckage of renewable resources: forests, soil, fish, freshwater, benign weather. Collapse will come one day, but not before we have pulled everything down with us. And even if there were an immediate economic cataclysm, it's not clear that the result would be a decline in our capacity for destruction. In east Africa, for example, I've seen how, when supplies of paraffin or kerosene are disrupted, people don't give up cooking; they cut down more trees. History shows us that wherever large-scale collapse has occurred, psychopaths take over. This is hardly conducive to the rational use of natural assets. All of us in the environment movement, in other words – whether we propose accommodation, radical downsizing or collapse – are lost. None of us yet has a convincing account of how humanity can get out of this mess. None of our chosen solutions break the atomising, planet-wrecking project. I hope that by laying out the problem I can encourage us to address it more logically, to abandon magical thinking and to recognise the contradictions we confront. But even that could be a tall order. • A fully referenced of this article can be found on George Monbiot's website"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2011/mar/29/japan-animation-natural-disaster-sotinel","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T12:59:01Z","webTitle":"Japan's fantasy films act as a buffer against the reality of the natural world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/29/japan-animation-natural-disaster-sotinel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2011/mar/29/japan-animation-natural-disaster-sotinel","fields":{"headline":"Japan's fantasy films act as a buffer against the reality of the natural world","bodyText":"In September 2008, Hayao Miyazaki, the author of Spirited Away, attended the Venice festival to present his most recent full-length film, Ponyo. In this city so closely connected with the sea, the Japanese director explained why he chose to end the film with a tsunami, and why the Japanese celebrate nature in spite of its destructive power. \"There are many typhoons and earthquakes in Japan,\" he said. \"There is no point in portraying these natural disasters as evil events. They are one of the givens in the world in which we live. I am always moved when I visit Venice to see that in this city which is sinking into the sea, people carry on living regardless. It is one of the givens of their life. In the same way people in Japan have a different perception of natural disasters.\" True enough, in Miyazaki's animated films nature dictates its terms on mankind. Ultimately the tsunami in Ponyo is beneficial for the country it wrecks, which with its ageing population and small coastal towns closely resembles the real Japan. But not all the pictures in Japanese films, whether animated or not, are underpinned by such environmentally aware animistic harmony. In most feature films the sea round Japan is a deadly enemy, stirred by subterranean forces. Alain Schlockoff, who organised the Paris Fantastic Film festival for many years and now edits L'Ecran Fantastique, a specialist magazine, was particularly impressed by Tidal Wave, a 1974 science fiction movie that caused a sensation in Japan. Based on Nihon Chinbotsu, a disaster novel by Sakyo Komatsu, the story hinged on the disappearance of the archipelago due to tsunamis and volcanic eruptions caused by shifting tectonic plates. \"Japanese film technicians are very good at building scale models and the pictures in the film were exactly like what we have just seen,\" says Schlockoff. It was remade in 2006, as The Submersion of Japan, testimony to the enduring appeal of such nightmares. Since 1945 and the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the awareness of the threat from the natural environment has been compounded by fear of nuclear war. The manga Barefoot Gen in Hiroshima was made into a film, but most cartoons depict the cities' destruction without explaining the cause. A typical example is the 2001 anime Metropolis, loosely based on Fritz Lang's eponymous work. Similarly Steamboy, by Katsuhiro Otomo, is set in a parallel world where neither the internal combustion engine nor nuclear power have been invented. Technology does, however, represent a deadly hazard for the community. The approach to these disasters is not so much premonitory. It is more a way of exorcising fears. Godzilla is the oldest instance, and the most famous. The monster was born in 1954, less than 10 years after the atom bombs, at the Toho studios, where a statue still stands. The giant lizard came into existence following experiments by American nuclear scientists. It was sufficiently powerful, tough and radioactive to destroy the whole of Tokyo and unlike King Kong prompted no sympathy at all, just terror. The film was such a success that about 30 follow-ups were made. In 1998, Hollywood commissioned Roland Emmerich to shoot a remake. In this version the mutation was caused by French nuclear tests in the Pacific. Yet another remake is on the way. Japan's nightmares are contagious. On 8 March, the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro announced that he was starting work on Pacific Rim, in which a fault in the ocean floor releases swarms of monstrous creatures that destroy Tokyo and Los Angeles. But some doubt the project will ever happen, given the fearful reality of the disaster that has now struck Japan. Watching the pictures on television Schlockoff admits to feeling \"somehow ashamed at having enjoyed these films\". They were, after all, a chilling premonition, not an exorcism. Driven by destruction Apocalyptic events, regardless of the form they take, are a central theme in mangas such as Ken the Survivor, Akira or Neon Genesis Evangelion. The threat of an earthquake or tsunami appears in many series, serving as a driving force in the narrative, a backdrop to romance or a remote starting point justifying the existence of a post-disaster world. The theme is also tied up with the various forms mangas may take, depending on their readership, with seinen, for adult readers, addressing \"serious\" topics, shojo for young women, shonen for their male counterparts and a host of other sub-genres. In Tokyo Mew Mew, a lightweight story for girls, the main character acquires magical powers and a feline appearance after an earthquake. At the other extreme Tokyo Magnitude 8 offers a realistic account of the consequences of a massive quake that devastates the archipelago. A fairly conventional rite of passage, the story centres on two survivors in the ruins of a man-made island wrecked by the tremor, but also describes rescue operations in considerable detail. Spirit of the Sun, by Kaiji Kawaguchi, is an outstanding manga, which starts with a gigantic quake, so severe it breaks Honshu, the largest island of Japan, in two. A tsunami follows, devastating what remains of the country. Under the pretence of providing humanitarian aid, the Chinese army takes over what soon becomes North Japan, whereas the US army occupies the south. Though at first sight a fairly typical example of the post-disaster genre, Spirit of the Sun offers a critical view of Japan in the 2000s, using its description of the living conditions of Japanese refugees in Taiwan to make barely veiled allusions to the strict immigration policies enforced by the government in Tokyo. Although earthquakes and tsunamis are recurrent motifs in many books and films, they are far from neutral. Publication of X, a fantasy inspired by the Bible, in particular the Apocalypse, was suspended for several months in 1995. Its recurrent tremors, purportedly announcing the imminent end of the world, upset many readers at a time when Kobe had just been hit by an earthquake that claimed nearly 6,500 lives. Several similar series are likely to be suspended in the near future. On television the rerun of an anime version of Tokyo Magnitude 8 has already been shelved, and other animes containing tsunami sequences have met a similar fate or are being rewritten.

The chancellor, George Osborne, announced in the spending review this week that the government would put £1bn into the bank and hoped to find extra funds from asset sales, although he did not say what would be sold. Chris Huhne, the climate secretary, today told the Guardian that he was looking at selling the UK's one third share in Urenco, a company it jointly owns with the Dutch government and two German power companies, RWE and E.ON. Urenco, which has a quarter of the growing global market for enriched uranium, was recently valued by the Adam Smith Institute thinktank at £3bn. However, the relinquishing of government control of such a politically and technologically sensitive company could prove controversial with anti-nuclear campaigners, including many in Huhne's own Liberal Democrat party. A previous attempt by the Labour government to sell its share in Urenco, in 2006, failed because it was blocked by the other shareholders. This may raise concerns about how long any fund-raising will take. Malcolm Grimston, associate fellow and nuclear expert at international affairs thinktank Chatham House, said a private sale of Urenco should not raise concerns about nuclear security, because of tight regulation. Uranium enriched for power has a very much lower content of fissile material, Uranium 235, than that used for weapons. \"The safeguards around materials are pretty strong and robust, and therefore I think the general feeling is the ownership is not a particular issue,\" said Grimston. Huhne's success in getting the Treasury to agree the £1bn was seen as a qualified success, being considerably less than the £2bn-6bn that City and environment experts had called for, and half what Nick Clegg told Lib Dem MPs on the morning of the spending review. \"The exact shape of the remit of the institution is still to be decided ... but the key thing is to have found a contribution to the capital from public spending, and we're continuing to work hard to find asset sales which will fund it,\" Huhne said. The chancellor's description of the new institution as a \"Green Investment Bank\" – using capital letters – was also seen as something of a victory after the Treasury apparently wanted to downgrade the coalition and manifesto promise to a \"fund\". Huhne suggested there was concern about liabilities the government could take on, saying: \"The Treasury has a lot of experience of banks over the last couple of years [and] the problem with our banks happened when money they lent wasn't paid back and money they borrowed had to be paid back.\" However he added: \"We found the capital for what the chancellor called a bank ... If we were to announce that we were going ahead with a bank which was not a bank a lot of people in the City would spot that very rapidly.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/28/japan-nuclear-plant-partial-meltdown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-28T19:26:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima's partial meltdown increases fears of contaminated seawater and soil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/japan-nuclear-plant-partial-meltdown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/28/japan-nuclear-plant-partial-meltdown","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima's partial meltdown increases fears of contaminated seawater and soil","bodyText":"High levels of radioactivity in water leaking from a reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant resulted from a partial meltdown of fuel rods, Japanese officials have said, amid growing fears that radiation may also have seeped into seawater and soil. Contamination in a pool of water in the turbine building of the No 2 reactor was found to be 100,000 times normal levels, the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said. On Sunday the firm said the figure was 10m times higher, a mistake the government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said was \"absolutely unforgivable\". Tepco was forced into another embarrassing apology after it admitted it had twice named the wrong isotope in its corrections about the levels of radiation. \"On one hand, I do think the workers at the site are getting quite tired,\" Edano told reporters. \"But these radiation tests are being used for making various decisions on safety … they are absolutely unforgivable.\" In addition, radiation above 1,000 millisieverts per hour was found in surface water in trenches outside the No 2 reactor, Tepco said. It added that the trenches did not lead to the sea, but conceded it could not rule out that radioactive water had seeped into the ground. Greenpeace, meanwhile, said that it had recorded radiation levels of up to 10 microsieverts per hour in Iitate, a village 25 miles from the plant, and urged authorities to expand the evacuation zone from its current 12-mile radius. \"It is clearly not safe for people to remain in Iitate, especially children and pregnant women, when it could mean receiving the maximum-allowed dose of radiation in only a few days,\" said Jan van de Putte, the group's radiation safety expert. \"When further contamination from possible ingestion or inhalation of radioactive particles is factored in, the risks are even higher.\" In a sign that Tepco is struggling to regain control of the reactors, it has reportedly asked the French nuclear sector for assistance. Tepco has sought help from Electricité de France, Areva and the Nuclear Energy Agency, a research body, Eric Besson, France's industry and energy minister, said. Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency (Nisa) said radioactive iodine-131 of 1,150 times the maximum allowable level had been detected in seawater near drainage outlets serving four of Fukushima's reactors. Nisa spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama said he suspected radioactive water from the plant was leaking into the sea. On Sunday he had denied any connection between the two. Edano said that partial meltdown had probably occurred when the plant was hit by the 11 March tsunami, adding that there was no evidence of subsequent meltdown. Four of the facility's six reactors are yet to be made safe, while efforts are continuing to pump in fresh water to prevent a far more dangerous full meltdown. \"The radiation seems to have come from fuel rods that were partially melted down and came into contact with the water used to cool the reactor,\" Edano said. \"Steam may have condensed … carrying water from within the containment vessel.\" Airborne radiation has been confined to the reactor buildings , and work to remove contaminated water from the structures continued on Monday. Recent setbacks to attempts to cool the reactors, and the realisation the crisis is far from over, have added to the plight of tens of thousands of people living nearby. Sakae Muto, vice-president of Tepco, said: \"Regrettably, we don't have a concrete schedule at the moment to enable us to say how many months, or years it will take [to make the plant safe].\" About 70,000 people within a 12-mile radius of the Fukushima plant were evacuated soon after the disaster, while a further 130,000 people living in a 12-20-mile radius have been told to stay indoors. The government said that it had no plans to widen the evacuation zone. Fukushima prefecture authorities do not have any exact figures on how many people remain in the 12.7-18.6 miles rradius. Many have left voluntarily after days of living without essential supplies and services. Media reports say that many truck drivers are refusing to enter the zone, fearing radiation exposure. The government created confusion last week when it advised people within a 20-mile radius to consider leaving the area. It insisted the advice was given due to concern for their quality of life, not exposure to harmful levels of radiation. According to the public broadcaster NHK, self-defence force personnel in the evacuation zone said 30 people had yet to leave the 12-mile evacuation zone, and 10 had indicated they wanted to remain in their homes. Evacuees have been urged not to return to the area to collect belongings while the Fukushima plant remains unstable. Residents who return, even temporarily, would expose themselves to \"great risk of radiation contamination\", Edano said. \"It is very likely that the 20km area is contaminated and there is a significant risk to health,\" he added. Local authorities reported, however, that some people had already returned. Others forced out of their homes are coming to terms with the possibility that they may never be able to return. Even if they do, the many residents who depended on Tepco for employment accept that with the plant ruined, their chances of finding work in the area are close to nil. A large number of evacuees have already moved twice since the nuclear crisis began, and could be forced to move on again if the situation worsens and the evacuation zone is expanded. \"We're assuming that in a worse-case scenario we might also be subject to evacuation,\" Norio Hattori, a disaster official in Nihonmatsu, said, adding that he had sent his own daughter to Tokyo. Some of the refugees are already beginning to accept that a vast area surrounding the Fukushima plant could be condemned as a nuclear wasteland. \"If it had been an earthquake or a tsunami, we could have gone home again, but because it's radiation, we can't,\" said Tokuko Sujimoto. Her home, in the village of Namie, was so close to the plant she heard the first reactor explosion on 12 March. She said that her husband had watched from the roof of their house as a cloud of smoke rose from the reactor, before the couple decided to flee. Yoshimoto Nogi, who had a job at the Fukushima plant until he retired last summer, said he had no hopes of going home this year. \"It's going to take a year or two. It is not a question of months,\" said Nogi. \"Even if the nuclear plant is stabilised tomorrow, I don't think the government is going to tell us it is safe to go back any time soon.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/aug/01/edf.britishenergy.nuclear1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-01T10:52:08Z","webTitle":"EDF decision sets back UK nuclear power plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/01/edf.britishenergy.nuclear1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/aug/01/edf.britishenergy.nuclear1","fields":{"headline":"EDF decision sets back UK nuclear power plans","bodyText":"Gordon Brown's plans to initiate the construction of a new generation of nuclear power stations suffered a setback today after the dramatic collapse of a £12bn takeover deal for British Energy. The French power giant EDF abandoned its plans to buy British Energy, the nuclear power group, after negotiations broke down unexpectedly at the last minute over the price. The decision will hold up the construction of new nuclear power stations, which the prime minister believes are essential if Britain wants to reduce its dependence on foreign energy supplies and contribute more to the battle against climate change. The Liberal Democrats claimed that the move left the government's energy policy \"in total disarray\". Steve Webb, their environment spokesman, said: \"New nuclear build is supposed to be a central part of the government's energy strategy, but it seems to be dependent on the decisions of foreign companies over whom it has absolutely no control.\" The deal was scuppered at the last minute by leading private shareholders of British Energy, which is 35% owned by the government. It is thought that Invesco, which owns a 15% stake, and M&amp;G were holding out for a higher price because of the surging cost of fuel. This led to a shock announcement from EDF, the world's largest nuclear power generator, in the early hours that it had backed out of the takeover deal for the UK nuclear power operator. The company, which is 85% owned by the French government, had been expected to announce details of the bid today. John Hutton, the business secretary, said he was \"disappointed that talks between British Energy and EDF have not yet been successful\". But he insisted that \"nuclear new build\" did not depend on a single deal and that other operators were interested in investing in the UK. Charles Hendry, the Conservative energy spokesman, said that the collapse of the talks was \"worrying but not critical\" to the future of the nuclear power industry. \"Time is not on our side, as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear. We need a clear resolution quickly, as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap,\" he said. But Mick Rix, the national officer of the GMB union, complained that the government's reliance on a market-led strategy was creating further uncertainty for the British Energy workforce. \"It is pathetic that a government minister who not only controls 35% of British Energy shares, and who also has to commit public and consumers' money to guarantee the future viability of the industry, and who represents the public interest when it comes to licensing and planning, should allow himself to be pushed about by British Energy shareholders who simply want to cash in on their ownership of licensed nuclear sites,\" he said. \"[Hutton] has got to get a grip and put the interest of the UK public who foot the bill before the self-interest of the shareholders.\" Greenpeace described the decision as \"a hammer blow for Gordon Brown's deluded nuclear ambitions\". Nathan Argent, head of its nuclear campaign, said the government should now ditch its nuclear policy. \"This takeover would have taken us back to the old days of a state-subsidised, monopolised nuclear power sector,\" Argent said. \"The French government, via EDF, would have the monopoly, while the British government, via the taxpayer, would have shelled out subsidies to the tune of billions.\" EDF put out a further statement this morning saying that a further announcement would be made when appropriate. Pierre Gadonneix, the company's chief executive, said: \"I confirm our ambition to be a major actor of the nuclear rebirth in Britain. We have been working on that for three years and we have taken measures to reach this target.\" But he added that \"financial conditions\" were not there yet for a move into Britain, which would have been the company's biggest foreign foray to date EDF referred to an earlier stock exchange announcement from British Energy this morning that \"advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date,\" leading to a sharp drop in its share price. The stock dropped 32p to 697.5p this morning, a fall of 4.4%, while EDF shares were down 0.66% in Paris. The bid is thought to have taken the form of either a cash-only deal worth 765p a share, or a cash option worth 700p a share plus shares. It would have netted the British government around £4.6bn, to be used for the clean-up of Britain's nuclear power stations. Although the collapse of the deal is a setback for ministers, the government does have other options. EDF may return to the negotiating table or British Energy's recalcitrant shareholders may be prepared to withdraw their opposition. Even if a bid does not emerge British Energy may be prepared to sell individual sites, or lease them, for nuclear new build. Nor is it the only organisation with nuclear sites. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority owns Britain's Magnox reactor sites which could prove suitable for a new generation of reactors, with the NDA's Wylfa plant in Anglesey seen as a likely contender. British Energy operates one coal-fired and eight ageing nuclear power stations, including Hinkley Point in Somerset, Torness near Edinburgh and Dungeness in Kent. Together, they produce one sixth of Britain's electricity. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, had also been expected to take part in the deal by acquiring a 25% stake in British Energy from EDF. EDF reported a bigger-than-expected 2% rise in half-year core earnings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/25/labour-liberal-democrats-green-manifestos","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-25T10:03:00Z","webTitle":"Labour and Liberal Democrats launch green manifestos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/25/labour-liberal-democrats-green-manifestos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/25/labour-liberal-democrats-green-manifestos","fields":{"headline":"Labour and Liberal Democrats launch green manifestos","bodyText":"Labour and the Liberal Democrats today published their green manifestos, highlighting wide differences between the two parties on how the UK will be powered in the future. Labour announced support for new low-carbon \"economic areas\" in each region, and 5,000 new apprentices in the clean-tech economy. The Lib Dems gave more details about their ambitious main manifesto pledge to create a zero-carbon Britain by the middle of the century. In addition to their earlier promise to generate all electricity from renewable sources – and at least three-quarters from offshore wind and marine or tidal power – the Lib Dems said Britain would have to slash emissions from transport, heating buildings, industry and agriculture. The UK could offset up to 10% of emissions by buying credits from overseas projects. Labour sources said the pledge was an \"empty gesture\" as MPs had already voted for an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. Last week, the party attacked the Lib Dems for saying such targets could be met without using nuclear power, which Labour and the Conservatives support. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem shadow climate and energy spokesman, told the Observer that the greater use of renewable energy in Scandanavia, the Netherlands and Germany showed that much more could be done, and privately other European politicians have spoken of decarbonising their economies without nuclear power. The Lib Dems want to focus on insulation programmes for homes and public buildings, and on boosting renewable energy industries, including a major apprenticeship scheme. The party said these plans would receive £3.1bn from other spending programmes in the first year, and income from a tax on planes in future years. Labour sources said low-carbon zones could provide a focus for different industries to work together. Existing examples include a marine energy hub in the south-west and an emerging electric car industry in the north-east. Other possible coalitions include carbon capture and storage for coal power in Yorkshire and Humberside. Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, said in his party's green manifesto that the Tories \"talk the talk on green issues only to align themselves with climate deniers in the European parliament\", and claims that voting for the Green party is a waste because they \"cannot make a difference in Westminster\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-george-osborne-homebuyers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T12:15:09Z","webTitle":"Budget 2011: George Osborne plans boost for homebuyers and drivers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-george-osborne-homebuyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-george-osborne-homebuyers","fields":{"headline":"Budget 2011: George Osborne plans boost for homebuyers and drivers","bodyText":"George Osborne has told the cabinet his budget will set out the government's plans to reform and rebalance the economy and help struggling families with the cost of living. The chancellor will seek to appeal to Britain's \"squeezed middle\" when he announces help for first-time buyers, motorists and 25 million income tax payers in a budget designed to tighten the Treasury's grip on public spending. Osborne briefed senior ministers including the prime minister, David Cameron, on the contents of his second budget at an 8am cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street Despite disappointing news for the public finances, the chancellor is expected to say that he has scope to raise the income tax personal allowance by £600 next year, fund a £250m shared equity scheme for new homes and defer the above-inflation increase in petrol duty due next month. But he will balance tax giveaways with tax-raising measures, a crackdown on tax avoidance and \"special measures\" for overspending Whitehall departments in what sources insisted would be a \"steady as she goes\" package. Cameron's official spokesman told reporters: \"The chancellor took the cabinet through the budget and set out the main aims ... which are to set out our plans for reforming and rebalancing the nation's economy and steps to help families with the cost of living.\" Osborne will outline a range of measures including a shake-up of planning laws, deregulation of employment laws affecting small businesses, and long-awaited plans for a green investment bank as the coalition seeks to shift the focus of the economy from deficit reduction to boosting growth. The chancellor will admit that the UK's growth prospects for 2011 have worsened since the autumn, with the independent Office for Budget Responsibility likely to pencil in an increase of around 1.8% in gross domestic product this year against the 2.1% it forecast in November. But Osborne will signal his determination not to let the government's deficit reduction plans slip, with controls designed to intensify pressure on ministers to rein in spending. Departments failing to manage their budgets properly will be placed in special measures – akin to the Ofsted rating given to a failing school – with tough penalties. These could include fines for overspending or being forced to seek Treasury authorisation for larger spending decisions. City hopes that public borrowing for 2010-11 would come in £10bn below the £148bn forecast were dented by news that the deficit in February topped £10bn – the highest for the month since modern records began in 1993. Meanwhile, inflation according to the consumer price index rose from 4% to a 28-month high of 4.4% last month, pushing up government spending on state benefits. Dearer food, fuel and clothing were the main factors behind last month's jump in inflation, which is now more than double the government's 2% target. The increase in the CPI measure of inflation was matched by a rise in the alternative yardstick of the cost of living, the retail prices index, which rose from 5.1% to 5.5% last month, its highest for 20 years. In a move that will please the Liberal Democrat wing of the coalition, Osborne will say that the income tax personal allowance – due to go up to £7,475 next month – will be raised by more than inflation from next year. The increase of around £600 – which comes on top of the £1,000 rise next month – will be worth an average of £45 a year for taxpayers earning up to £115,000 a year. The 550,000 taxpayers who earn more than £115,000 will lose £45 a year because they no longer have a personal allowance. Osborne will announce a joint scheme with the construction industry to help some of the potential first-time buyers currently frozen out of the housing market. First-time buyers with a household income of less than £60,000 a year who can put down a 5% deposit on a new home will be eligible for an equity loan worth up to 20% of the value of the property jointly funded by the government and housebuilders. The loan will be interest-free for five years, and will only be repayable when the house is sold. With most first-time buyers only able to secure mortgages worth 75% of a property's value, Osborne is expected to say his scheme will give some young people the chance to meet the exacting loan standards demanded by lenders in the wake of the financial crisis, lead to the building of 10,000 new homes and protect 40,000 jobs in the construction industry. The year-long cabinet battle over Britain's ability to invest in the next generation of green infrastructure will be resolved when a green investment bank is established with access to up to £3bn of funds, and an ability to borrow from April 2015. Green groups will be disappointed about the deferral of borrowing powers but pleased at the higher than expected interim funding. The battle over the bank was resolved on Sunday, and the outcome reflects a wider political struggle to ensure plans in the budget to ease pressure on the squeezed middle, including freezing planned fuel duty rises, do not strip the coalition of its green credentials. Ministers admit the deferral of the bank's borrowing powers to 2015-16 reflects Treasury determination to ensure net debt as a percentage of GDP is falling by 2015-16. But they also argue that decisions on the next big wave of green investment projects, including offshore wind farms, do not need to be made until after 2015. In a negotiating success for Chris Huhne, the energy secretary, the bank will be given access to £1bn of funds from 2012-13, as opposed to the earlier plan to wait until 2013-14. The bank will also be given access, from 2012-13, to £775m from the asset sales from HS1, the superfast rail track between London and the Channel tunnel. In addition, the bank will have access to £1bn from the sales from 2013-14 from Urenco, the company that makes enriched uranium from nuclear power. The government owns one-third of Urenco jointly with the Dutch government and German energy companies RWE and E.On. The Treasury has given a guarantee that if the income from the sale of Urenco is not forthcoming, the green bank will have access to other funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
