Far less focus has been placed on the practical positive steps that can be taken at community level. That's why the government has commissioned research to find out why people are getting involved in the growing community energy movement, and what might encourage more of it. People across the country are coming together to change the way we think about our energy system and their relationship with it. From a community-run advice service in Hampshire that promotes energy efficiency to a community-owned windfarm just north of Swansea, to a renewable heat project in Herefordshire that replaces fossil fuels with locally grown biomass. Today I will be visiting the Repowering London project in Brixton. Several hundred square metres of solar panels have been installed on six blocks in the Loughborough Estate and the project is providing work placement opportunities for local young and unemployed people from the estate. These examples are fantastic and extremely encouraging. I want to see community energy projects rolled out across the country, but we need a strategy to help unlock the potential. And that strategy has to be informed by the best available evidence. Our initial research found that keeping energy bills down is the main driver for people to get involved in community energy projects. Environmental reasons – like the desire to be active in the fight against climate change – and the aspiration to help improve wellbeing in disadvantaged neighbourhoods were also key factors. I strongly believe that there is appetite for this grassroots approach and want to see nothing short of a community energy revolution. I am supporting collective purchasing and switching to help more and more people to buy energy together, but I also want to see more people saving and generating energy together. • The Department of Energy and Climate Change on Thursday launched a call for evidence on community energy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/oct/31/britain-solar-energy-unsustainable-foundations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-31T00:05:00Z","webTitle":"Britain's solar energy boom is built on unsustainable foundations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/31/britain-solar-energy-unsustainable-foundations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/31/britain-solar-energy-unsustainable-foundations","fields":{"headline":"Britain's solar energy boom is built on unsustainable foundations","bodyText":"You can't miss Britain's solar energy boom. Solar panels generating electricity adorn tens of thousands of British homes, providing clean green energy. But the uncomfortable truth is that, with overgenerous subsidies failing to keep pace with plummeting costs, this boom has been built on unsustainable foundations. That is why we are proposing timely measures to reform the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme and ensure this vital green industry has a long-term future. It's easy to see why solar is so attractive: it's simple, accessible, reliable and fits discreetly into homes and communities. It's a vital component of our decentralised local energy revolution. But however convinced we may be of the long-term potential of solar, we have to face up to the economic reality that every other sector of the economy is challenged by. The green economy does not exist in a bubble. The huge subsidised returns for people investing in solar photovoltaic panels – funded from everybody's energy bills – have now broken double figures and cannot continue. The good news is that the costs of the technology have plunged – by at least 30% – since the scheme started in April 2010. A home installation can now cost around £9,000 or less. A similar installation would have set you back an extra £4,000 less than two years ago. With installed capacity nearly three times that projected by the last government when it launched the scheme 18 months ago, it all means that solar is burning through its budget at an unsustainable rate. The generous pot of £867m secured for the feed-in tariff scheme by the coalition last year will be completely devoured if we don't act now. I still believe passionately that feed-in tariffs are essential. But there is a delicate balancing act to perform to avoid the boom and bust already experienced in countries such as Italy, Spain and France, fuelled by over-generous subsidy. The challenge we face is to use that public investment to obtain the widest possible deployment. I don't want a tariff that gives bumper returns to a lucky few but a tariff that incentivises sensible deployment, in the right place, on the right buildings in the greatest numbers. The coalition's proposals are about making the FIT scheme more intelligent, more nimble and responsive to market development and, crucially, better value for money for our hard-pressed consumers. We'll also fix one of the biggest failures of the scheme, namely its failure to require basic energy efficiency measures to be put in place before subsidies are claimed to generate renewable electricity. Our proposals will mean only energy efficient buildings will get the full PV subsidy from April next year. This new requirement will encourage the industry to make the most of their skills and expertise and work much more closely with the rapidly expanding energy efficiency market. By taking timely and responsible action to protect the long-term future of the FIT budget, rather than putting our head in the sand, we will forge a sustainable future for the UK's solar industry. Used wisely the tariff scheme offers the potential for millions of consumers to generate more of their own green electricity and break the grip of the over-dominant energy companies. I want to fix the feed-in tariff scheme, enhance it and put the whole microegeneration industry on a credible path to a bright and exciting future.

The traders grinding fresh, specialty coffee are also doing a cracking trade; TV chef Simon Rimmer showcases seasonal foods in his cooking demos; and, at the micro-bar, they are handing out samples of locally brewed craft beers. This isn't Borough Market, London: this is Bolton – and if you want a glimpse of what a sustainable market of the future should look like, industry experts claim you should look no further. Three years ago, however, it was a different story. The market was popular with locals, and its food outlets were winning awards, including Best Food Market at the BBC Radio 4 Food and Farming Awards 2011. But the building was run down: even loyal customers were complaining about the state of the loos and the lack of decent baby-changing facilities. The roof was in a bad state of repair and the building – as Jackie Casey, general market manager at Bolton market, admits – \"was not fit for purpose\". Food markets are often neglected by local councils, which fail to recognise their social capital, so organisations – such as the National Market Traders Federation – have been waging vigorous campaigns to try to reverse this problem. But Bolton council took a modern, radical approach. Casey says: \"The council understands the value of the market; it employs 500 local people and supports 300 small businesses.\" The council invested £4.5m from its capital account into the market, money that does not have to be repaid, either by the traders or by customers paying inflated prices. Some of the money was spent on an overhaul of the market's basic design, the conventional grid format giving way to clear sight lines and a clean, light feel. The roof has been repaired at a cost of £600,000 and photovoltaics (PVs) have been installed to provide solar energy and reduce energy bills. Every market unit now has an individual electricity meter, which means traders can control their energy usage and pay monthly. Previously, only some traders had meters, which caused tensions because – while everyone shared the overall energy bill – some traders left their lights on overnight. The market has recycling points for cardboard and polystyrene, and a food-waste collection point is being installed. It is also piloting a computer-controlled, microbial fermentation unit, to reduce the need for chemical detergent and the problem of blocked drains. Naturally occurring bacteria are pumped into drains and pipes, and these eat the grease to prevent a buildup. A key part of the market's redevelopment is the bright and spacious lifestyle food hall, with 40 businesses, lots of new stalls and a central area with chunky wooden furniture and free Wi-Fi. Bolton now sets a new benchmark for markets, according to Malcolm Veigas, policy officer for the National Association of British Market Authorities. He says: \"For a sustainable model, which is designed to support a thriving market as well as populate the local high street with small independents, Bolton really is the one to watch.\" Alongside its traditional fare of fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, biscuits, bread, cakes and sweets, the market now has a wider offering – and is pulling in a new crowd, the sort that wants top-notch coffee at The Coffee Grind, olive flatbreads and African curries (which can work out cheaper than the packaged sandwiches, crisps and drink offers at the major chains). Alain Job runs the Nkono stall, which sells curries wrapped in banana leaves. He says: \"The response has been overwhelming. People are coming in for healthy meals and the fresh ingredients available at the market. At my stall, the sustainable packaging is also popular. The leaves are bio-degradable – and it means there's no washing up.\" Despite the influx of new faces, Bolton market has a loyal customer base, so it's determined to stay inclusive. \"We've kept around 70% of our traditional traders, some of whom have been with us for 15 years or so,\" says Casey: \"You can still buy pasties and pies.\" In a bid to help everyone make the most of the market, it runs a wellbeing programme in partnership with the NHS. Locals can attend free sessions, and traders teach them how to buy and cook affordable foods. Casey says: \"We want to help make buying cheaper cuts of meat, for example, as accessible as possible, so we offer samples, tasting sessions and ideas for how to buy and cook fresh ingredients.\" Individual traders run loyalty schemes and interact with customers through social media. It's a much-needed strategy because Bolton – like many other towns in the north-west of England – has a high number of empty retail units in its high street: recent Local Data Company figures show an average of 17% of empty shops in this region, compared with 12% nationally. \"We want to invigorate the centre,\" says Veigas: \"There's a great atmosphere at the market – with businesses keen to help each other – and we try to help too, with networking, as well as the enterprise hubs. Recently, for example, a florist wanted to get their displays into hotel lobbies, so we invited people from the tourist board to our launch event and put them in touch.\" This is a market that seems determined to succeed and traders are looking at every possible means to reach their customers.

Both were nominated for Oscars. Salaam Cinema, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, 1995 For this film, Mohsen Makhmalbaf announces a casting call: thousands of people turn up and there’s a riot to get in. Each participant is channelling their worries and hopes into the desire to be in a film. He interacts with them in this dictatorial way, which makes the film ultimately about power and authority. He demands that people cry on command. One woman becomes so frustrated that she does start to cry, so he says OK, you’ve made it. And she’s so happy, but then there’s the disappointment as she realises this was her moment on screen. She thought there’d be a script and a real film to make afterwards. It’s a devastating, beautiful film. Close Up, Abbas Kiarostami, 1990 A man pretends to be Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the director of Salaam Cinema. He insinuates himself into a family’s life out of loneliness, to make friends. At one point the family realise he’s not really the director and have him arrested. The film follows this man’s trial in an Iranian court, and then the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf meets the man and takes him to the family. The impostor’s fragility ultimately embodies what it means to be poor and struggling in life, and through that you feel how sad it is that we live in a world where people are measured by wealth and power, and the cruelty that any human being could ever feel insignificant. Gates of Heaven, Errol Morris, 1978 This was Errol Morris’s first film. He was taking his time with it so Werner Herzog promised “If you finish this film I will eat my shoe,” which he did. It’s about two families in California who run pet cemeteries, and it looks at humans’ relationships to their pets. It’s an odd mystery, a pet. We eat animals, we use them for labour, but then we keep them in our home as objects upon which we project love that we maybe lack elsewhere. Morris has these carefully crafted tableaux: there’s one continuous shot where a woman has a 15-minute lament, complaining about aspects of her life, and that’s where the film becomes something altogether greater and more mysterious. Loss Is to Be Expected, Ulrich Seidl, 1992 This was made shortly after the fall of communism in eastern Europe and it looks at two communities on either side of the Czech-Austrian border. There’s an elderly man in Austria looking for a new wife, and he meets a lone single woman on the Czech side of the border. There are these amazing scenes where they go on a date to a funfair and then to a sex museum. She’s much more sexually comfortable than he is, which is a source of incredible comedy. But it’s about desire and love and the fulfilling of our quotidian needs and the necessary, wilful blindness towards our deeper needs because ultimately, to contemplate those needs is to contemplate our own mortality. The Hour of the Furnaces, Octavia Getino and Fernando e Solanas, 1968 This is a furious, angry film about neocolonialism in Argentina, and it’s the most devastating look at colonialism I’ve seen in nonfiction films. The sections about Argentina’s oligarchy, and the exploitation on which they thrived, are so poetically rendered that you relate to the horror of dictatorship purely through your emotions. It was made secretly and was screened at illegal opposition meetings, in defiance of the authoritarian rule. People were arrested for screening it. I imagine that seeing it at the time you would come out feeling like you’d have to do something about the situation. There are sections of The Act of Killing where I surely had this film in the back of my head. KB Lucy Walker: ‘The Up series showed me what the medium was capable of’ British director Lucy Walker has been Oscar-nominated twice, for Waste Land (2010) and The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom (2011). She is currently working on a follow-up to Buena Vista Social Club. Hoop Dreams, Steve James, 1994 Hoop Dreams follows two very talented African American boys in Chicago who get a basketball scholarship to go to a prestigious, predominantly white high school. It follows them for five years and it’s a spectacular example of a longitudinal documentary where you get to glimpse the machinery of life. You get a real sense of time unfolding and the big forces that act on us. The twists and turns are subtle, nothing much happens, and yet it feels incredibly dramatic and compelling because it’s so well crafted and the characters are so beautifully rendered. I watched it repeatedly when I was making my first film, Devil’s Playground, because it follows young people through this pivotal period in their lives, and I was trying to understand how you could get so much narrative, emotion and character into a film. There’s a scene where the mum is icing a birthday cake for her son’s 16th birthday. It’s an interview, in the sense that the film-maker is asking her questions and she’s talking to camera, but it doesn’t feel like one, it’s so much more cinematic and compelling and the activity is so perfect. Streetwise, Martin Bell, 1984 This film had its beginnings in a photojournalism assignment for Life magazine by the photographer Mary Ellen Mark about a group of street kids living in Seattle. She persuaded her husband, Martin Bell, to make a film about them. It’s just so intimate that it’s hard to believe the film-maker is actually in the room with these kids. It’s like he’s put on a cloak of invisibility. I could have chosen any number of cinema vérité masterpieces but for some reason this moves me. I’ve made quite a few films with young people and it’s fascinating because the plot of their lives is so close to the surface: one conversation can change the course of your life when you’re young in a way that is rare when you’re older – and you can capture that nano-second when the course of a life’s direction is altered. When you put a camera and a film crew into a room, the observer’s paradox is almost always true – you can’t capture life because you’re in the way of it. But these kids seem unaware of the camera and they’re behaving in a way that feels like life unfolding. The filmmaker is so present with them, you can’t help but understand what they’re going through, and to understand is to feel empathy and to want to help. The Five Obstructions, Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, 2003 In this underrated film the iconoclastic Danish director Lars von Trier challenges experimental film-maker Jørgen Leth to remake one of his earlier films, The Perfect Human, five times, each time with a different creative constraint. The first “obstruction” imposed by von Trier, for example, was that the film had to be made in Cuba, using shots of no more than 12 frames. Another was that it had to be made as a cartoon. It’s basically these two creative egos going up against each other and it gives a fascinating insight into the film-making process, what goes on in a director’s head and how you cope with stress and constraint and challenge. It’s delicious and playful and there’s never a dull moment watching these two maestros needling each other. The Gleaners and I, Agnès Varda, 2000 This film was made during the early days of the hand-held digital camera, when for the first time you could capture something high-quality enough to show on a big screen on a camera that would fit in your handbag. It’s an essay about the people who pick through other people’s leftovers, whether it be the remains of the harvest in the countryside, or in cities. It’s very casual, but Varda is so astute and the quality of the film-making is such that it becomes something very beautiful, a meditation on life. We’re having this golden age of documentary right now and it’s being driven by technology. In the past you would need to write a script first because the editing process was so laborious but now you can shoot a whole bunch of stuff and capture life in a way that you couldn’t before and this film, shot by a 72-year-old woman using a very low-key format, shows you just what level of artistry is possible. Up series, Michael Apted, 1964 I’m fascinated by longitudinal film-making and this series, which has followed the lives of 14 British children since 1964, when they were seven years old, showed me what the medium was capable of. This series is head and shoulders above any other attempt to record dramatically a whole human life. And because it’s a whole group of people, you learn not just about the individual but also about the system in which they’re living. I can’t think of any other artefact in our culture that can tell us so much about Britain in our lifetime and how society is evolving as this body of work. It’s illuminating and fascinating and it’s one of the things that inspired me to do the work that I do. JO’C Alex Gibney: ‘Fake home movies don’t bother me – you might as well object to dreams’ Alex Gibney’s award-winning films include Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room (2005), Taxi to the Dark Side (2007) and Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (2012). Last year he released documentaries on Scientology and Steve Jobs. He says: “I don’t believe in ‘five best films’. But I do believe in influential films. These are five of mine.” Night and Fog, Alain Resnais, 1955 What really impressed me about this film was its concision. It’s about the Holocaust, but it has a simple and horrible beauty to it, because it describes the terrifying nature of the Holocaust through a powerful series of images and a narration that was specific, naming the collections of items of the prisoners and survivors. It’s the cruel poetry of detail that is so heartbreaking: the handles of the ovens, the fingernail scrapings on the ceilings of the cells. We see piles of combs, shaving brushes, shoes and a vast mountain of human hair. It took something so horrible but found a way to go to the heart of the matter through simple details. Gimme Shelter , Albert and David Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin 1970 Here you see the Rolling Stones on tour singing about sympathy for the devil, but their posturing about satanism blows back at them at the Altamont music festival. It’s structured like a detective story: it starts with a murder – a Hell’s Angel stabs somebody who seems to have a gun in the audience – and then you go back in time. Maybe one of the most powerful scenes is of the Stones listening to a playback of Wild Horses in the studio. It’s stunning in its simplicity. That film went way beyond a concert show; it celebrates music but it’s really about a moment in time and how dark forces get unleashed. It’s powerful both in its observation and its analysis, which is a rare combination. When We Were Kings , Leon Gast, 1996 This is maybe the greatest sport film ever made. It has wonderful cinema vérité footage of the “Rumble in the Jungle”, the famous 1974 fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Gast has the most magnificent material, particularly in Muhammad Ali on a run, dancing, gooning for the camera, at his most charismatic. And then the brooding figure of George Foreman. But Gast wasn’t able to put that footage together, and in comes Taylor Hackford, shoots some interviews with people who were there, notably George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, and through their recollection you also have a sense of analysis and understanding rather than mere observation. So it’s combining those two things in the film that really is magnificent. Stories We Tell, Sarah Polley, 2012 This is a detective story that’s very much in the first person. It’s about identity, trying to understand your childhood, and ultimately paternity. Sarah Polley is digging back into the relationship between her mother and father, who she discovers isn’t her biological father. In some quarters she was criticised for using a series of fictional home movies that she manufactured, but it didn’t bother me at all – they might as well object to dreams and memories, because those are everyday recreations. The trick is finding the poetry in them. It’s a very powerful film about memory and exploration and love, because she comes to appreciate her adoptive father in a way she might not otherwise have done. Waltz With Bashir , Ari Folman, 2008 Part of the small but growing category of the animated documentary, Waltz With Bashir is really a film about repressed memory, and the recollection of Israeli soldiers trying to understand why they’re having these nightmares. The idea of using animation to convey what is mostly going on inside their heads, in their imaginations, is such a powerful one. It doesn’t become clear until almost the end that the soldiers all took part in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camp massacre in Lebanon in 1982. And the very end of the film includes just the slightest bit of real footage: a woman wailing in the wake of that massacre. It really is one of the most poignant films about the trauma of war. KB Kim Longinotto: ‘All the good TV documentaries are on the BBC at the moment’ British film-maker Kim Longinotto tackles themes such as female genital mutilation (The Day I Will Never Forget) and women fighting abuse (Sisters in Law). Her most recent film, Dreamcatcher, is on Chicago women trying to leave the sex industry. Sherman’s March, Ross McElwee, 1986 I saw this at film school, then watched it again at a festival a couple of years ago and thought it was so charming, so good. It has a very simple premise. The director is meant to be making a film about General Sherman’s march through Georgia during the American civil war, but he falls out of love with the idea. Instead, the film becomes about his attempts to find a girlfriend, shot as a kind of video diary – an approach that was completely new at the time. It’s so candid and affectionate and lovely, and everyone at the festival loved it. Not many films bear rewatching, but this one does. Tales of the Grim Sleeper, Nick Broomfield, 21 Nick Broomfield has become much more serious and political in recent years and this is a difficult and committed film. It’s about a man who was arrested in 2010 for killing as many as 100 prostitutes in Los Angeles over a period of 25 years. What’s extraordinary is how he managed to get away with it for so long – the police didn’t pursue because his victims were mostly black prostitutes. It’s a very timely film, in terms of Black Lives Matter and police abuses in the US, and I thought he got it just right. It’s also a really good crime story. Solar Mamas, Jehane Noujaim and Mona Eldaief, 2012 This is a film about Bedouin women trying to get solar energy in their village in Jordan. It follows one woman travelling to a college in India to become a solar engineer. I like it because it’s not saying, “Oh, look at these poor women.” Instead, it shows women actively changing their lives and I found that very inspiring. So many documentaries tell you what to think. This one doesn’t – it puts you straight into the story and you get to know the characters just by watching them. It was part of a very good BBC series on poverty. That’s where all the good TV documentaries are at the moment: on the BBC. Virunga, Orlando von Einsiedel, 2014 I watched this in the cinema, which was good because it’s very beautifully filmed – a real spectacle. It’s set in a reserve in the Congo, which is home to the last mountain gorillas on earth and it follows the people who are trying to save them, as well as the corrupt people trying to get the land to drill oil. There’s a moment when the people in a neighbouring village are attacked. It was filmed so well, I don’t know how they did it. You’re right in the thick of it and you feel so angry, because you know it all comes down to corruption and greed. Five Broken Cameras, Emad Burnat, Guy Davidi, 2011 This is about a Palestinian man who films the destruction of his village’s olive groves by the Israeli army. His cameras keep getting broken by the Israelis, hence the title, but he just kept filming. I think he was feeling: “There’s an incredible wrong being done to my people, I’m going to film it, even if I die doing it.” Then he linked up with an Israeli film-maker, who edited the footage. I remember people saying he shouldn’t have worked with an Israeli, but I thought it was so great that they came together and made something very powerful which showed us what is really going on in Palestine. KF James Marsh: ‘In my view there should be no boundaries to film-making’ James Marsh is a British film-maker, best known for the Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire (2008) and the acclaimed Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything. Man with a Movie Camera, Dziga Vertov, 1929 This was the first truly subversive, playful documentary. It’s notionally a day in the life of a city in the Soviet Union and so it has, on a purely sociological/historical level, great value. But what it does beyond that is to show you the means of production: the filming, the cutting room, the editing – all the things that are going into the making of this film. It’s way before its time, the Tristram Shandy of documentaries, if you like. It’s so inventive and it has techniques that, 87 years later, still look pretty revolutionary: the freeze frames and slow motion. It’s just full of inventive and brilliant formal ideas as well as being a very beautiful film to watch. And it’s informative too, showing us the Soviet Union in a halcyon period before Stalin’s terror, when you felt that things were still possible in a new political context. Of course we now know that Vertov suffered in the Stalin era, as many other independent artists would have done, but there’s a sort of optimism and a playfulness to it that you wouldn’t expect from a Soviet documentary from 1929. Le Sang des Bêtes, Georges Franju, 1949 This is a documentary about an abattoir that was made in Paris just after the second world war. If the film had been shot in colour it would be unwatchable, it’s so gory and weird and disturbing, but it’s in black and white and so it becomes a bit more abstract. There are images in that film that I think are some of the most powerful I’ve ever seen. There’s a surreal sequence where lots of sheep have been beheaded and they’re all dancing without their heads on this conveyor belt. It’s like a bit of choreographed horror, but it’s all real. The director Georges Franju went on to have a career doing very artistic horror movies in French cinema, most famously a film called Les Yeux Sans Visage. The War Game, Peter Watkins, 1965 In this film, Watkins takes a possible scenario – a nuclear attack on London – and shows you very carefully, each step of the way, what is likely to happen. It was banned by the BBC for many years because it was just too harrowing a depiction of a reality that everyone at that time was very concerned about: this was in the middle of the cold war and at the time there were dozens of warheads pointing at us. It’s like a documentary made by Brecht – you’re staging something to flush out a reaction in the audience, and that reaction is one of utter horror. Some people would say this is not a documentary because everything was staged, but it’s a speculative documentary – the director is saying: “This is how it could be and I’m going to show you this in a way that’s very truthful.” It’s very responsible, even if the imagery is very disturbing: you’re seeing bobbies firing at people in the street, people with their clothes burned off. His information is sourced directly from the government and based on scientific fact, so the bed of it is factual, and people responded to it as if it were a real documentary. It’s a brilliant and bold piece of film-making. He’s reinventing the documentary and subverting it. In my view there should be no rules and no boundaries to film-making, and the impact this film had shows you how much he got right. The Battle of Chile, Patricio Guzmán, 1975, 1976, 1979 This is a trilogy of films that chronicles the coup against the democratically elected leftwing government of Salvador Allende. It shows you the breakdown of a society and the triumph of the greater evil once there’s a political vacuum, so it’s a very strongly political film but it’s also, dare I say it, incredibly exciting. For me, this is the first great example of a film-maker being there while it’s all actually happening and there are moments in it that are utterly heartbreaking. Notoriously, there’s one point where they are filming a demonstration and you hear a gunshot and you see the camera just fall down and tip over and the cameraman has been shot and killed. That shows you the terror of these situations, where no one is safe from the forces of darkness, but also the commitment of the film-maker to document this, to extract a proper historical document from these terrible events. It’s a work of great bravery and definitive historical significance. Primate, Frederick Wiseman, 1974 Wiseman is probably my favourite film-maker in fiction or nonfiction, and Primate meant a lot to me because I made a film [Project Nim] that emerged from some of its ideas. It’s a portrait of a primate experimental laboratory in Texas and there’s imagery that you cannot forget. You see operations on animals that are still alive, their brains being looked at while they’re still twitching around, so it’s very disturbing and upsetting. It’s an interesting window on the hubris of science, which does things for its own sake because it can do them. A lot of the experiments done in this laboratory seem utterly pointless. Wiseman is a purist. He doesn’t use commentary, he doesn’t use music, he doesn’t use interviews, he just observes things and then finds a rhythm in his cutting room to show you the reality, usually of an institution, and the human fallibilities of institutions. Primate is really about the humans, not the animals. The animals hold a mirror up to people in that institution, and we don’t pass that test very well. J’OC Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy: ‘Documentaries can change the way people look at things’ The journalist and film-maker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was born in Karachi, Pakistan. Her films Saving Face (2012), about acid attacks in Pakistan, and A Girl in the River (2015), which tackled the subject of honour killings, both won Oscars for best short subject documentary. Amy, Asif Kapadia, 2015 It’s so rare that someone’s life has been so well documented. From when Amy Winehouse was very young right up to the time she died, people were filming her: her family, her friends, the media. I absolutely loved the way Asif Kapadia told her story using all that footage – as if he was with Amy her whole life. As a viewer, you really get to know her and understand what she went through. You’re cheering her on, hoping that she does get over her addiction, does beat the paparazzi, does come out on top. The film made me realise how much of her life was not in her hands. Iraq in Fragments, James Longley, 2006 I was amazed that this film was shot on a camcorder, because it was so beautiful and it showed Iraq in a completely different light. All the images coming out of Iraq at the time were images of war. This showed what everyday life felt like – it was almost as if the director was shutting the war out. You felt the violence, but he doesn’t show it. The film records three different perspectives. One storyline follows a young Sunni boy without a father in Baghdad, another shows you the followers of the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the south, and in the third you’re with a Kurdish family in the north who are happy the Americans are there. It also tracks how Iraq has changed from one generation to the next. Buena Vista Social Club, Wim Wenders, 1999 Cuba was a mystery to many people when this film was made. It was under sanctions and closed off to the US. With Buena Vista Social Club, it was as if Wim Wenders put aside the sanctions, the politics, and played with the language of music. These musicians and their stories moved people, whatever their politics. The film put you on the streets of Havana, you saw how people ate, how they interacted with each other, the way they danced and sang. Even without being political, the film is political, because it shows you what life was like inside Cuba at a time when the only perspective you got on the country was through a news lens. The Thin Blue Line, Errol Morris, 1988 This film showed me that documentaries can change the way people look at things. It’s centred on a murder that took place in 1976: a young man stole a car, picked up a hitchhiker called Randall Adams and later a policeman was shot and killed by someone in the car. Adams was given a life sentence for the murder but Morris’s documentary showed, by exploring the testimony and the way the police put the case together, that he had been wrongly accused. A year after the film came out, Adams was released from prison. That was the bit about the movie that really shook me. It oscillated between art and activism. It was a gripping drama but it also had an impact in the real world. Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore, 2002 This was a landmark film for me because it made documentaries popular – people who didn’t normally watch documentary films watched this. It tells the story of the Columbine high school massacre and the investigations that followed, but more than that it tells you about the National Rifle Association, about gun violence, about how schools in Michigan had become battlegrounds. His interview with Charlton Heston, who was the NRA’s president at that time, was very powerful and I remember the scene where he goes into a bank and gets a free hunting rifle for opening an account. On the way out, he asks: “Do you think it’s a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?” He told the story beautifully and he asked the questions a viewer would want to ask. KF Franny Armstrong: ‘By the end of Some Kind of Monster, I quite liked Metallica’ Franny Armstrong is the UK director of The Age of Stupid, a reflection from 2055 on climate change, McLibel, about the McDonald’s court case, and Drowned Out,, on the fight against the Narmada dam. Global Report, Peter Armstrong, 1981 This was a BBC documentary made by my father in the 1980s. I remember he took me on a trip to New York when I was eight years old and I ended up watching it over and over again. It just really blew my mind. I’d never been out of the UK and suddenly I was seeing this extreme wealth on show in New York and at the same time being hit by the extreme poverty in my dad’s film. I’ve chosen it because I think that’s where my whole drive to change things for the better came from. It shows five different stories from different parts of the world. It’s a bit similar to Unreported World, but back then it was considered groundbreaking. It was telling the stories that the rest of the media weren’t telling and the one that stuck with me was the story about a little boy my age in India who was having to sell peanuts on the side of the road in order to make money for his family. That was my introduction to the concept of inequality. The Queen of Versailles, Lauren Greenfield, 2012 Inequality is obviously one of the key issues of our time and I think this is the best film I’ve seen on the subject. The film-makers were following this mega-rich American family, the Siegels, who were building the biggest house in the United States – a mansion in Florida inspired by Versailles – and then the financial crash happens and they lose lots of money and they can’t finish it. They’ve got lots of children who are being looked after by a Filipina nanny, who we learn hasn’t seen her own children for years because she can’t afford a ticket to go home. The thing that really stayed with me was when the children’s pet lizard dies because nobody had fed it and it turns out that they didn’t even know they had a pet lizard because they’re so overwhelmed with material possessions. Everyone in the film is unhappy, the ones who’ve got too much stuff and the woman who can’t see her own kids. It’s an amazing example of the story of a major global issue being told in a very small way, in this case through a dead lizard. Blackfish, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, 2013 This is perhaps an odd choice, because I haven’t actually seen it as I find the subject matter too upsetting, but I’ve chosen it as an example of a documentary that sets out to change something material and succeeds. It’s about Tilikum, a performing killer whale being kept in captivity at SeaWorld. In the last few weeks, SeaWorld has announced that it will no longer breed orcas in captivity or acquire any new ones. It shows how one extremely powerful documentary can work alongside campaigning and holding demonstrations to bring about change. Lessons of Darkness, Werner Herzog, 1995 Lessons of Darkness is by the far the most powerful anti-war film I’ve ever seen. It was shot just after the first Gulf war, when the Iraqi oilfields were famously set on fire. The film is essentially just a continuing aerial shot of these burning oilfields set to beautiful music. It’s completely mesmeric and beautiful in an apocalyptic way, and it just goes on and on. You can’t believe how big, how many and how endless these oilfields are, or how wanton the destruction is. And just when you’re thinking “OK, I’ve had enough” it cuts to a mother and a child and the mother just tells the story of what happened to her family during the war, and then she says, of the boy who is about five years old: “This child has never spoken again.” And that’s all there is to the film. It’s so bold. You have to be Werner Herzog to get away with that. Some Kind of Monster, Joe Berlinger, Bruce Sinofsky, 2004 I’ve chosen this as a bit of light relief, because it’s rip-roaring fun. The film follows the heavy metal band Metallica as they go through group therapy. God knows how the directors ever got permission to do it, but it’s just so incongruous to see these ageing rockers discussing their personal problems in such an open way. What strikes you is the difference between their tough image and music and the pettiness of their squabbles over who gets the most credit on a record. It follows them over a couple of years while they’re rehearsing a new album and searching for a new bass player, but you also get to see them trying to balance their personal lives with being heavy metal performers – you see one of the band members going to his daughter’s ballet class, for example. It’s way more absurd than Spinal Tap, but what’s most strange is that by the end of it I actually quite liked their music and I’m really not a heavy metal fan. J’OC Khalo Matabane: ‘Some film-makers try to be objective, but Herzog isn’t shy’ Khalo Matabane was born in Limpopo, South Africa. His documentaries include Nelson Mandela: The Myth and Me and Story of a Beautiful Country, a road movie that explores post-apartheid South Africa. When the Levees Broke, Spike Lee, 2006 I saw this four-part documentary in a single night at a friend’s house in Amsterdam and I was completely blown away. It’s an angry, in-depth look at how the levees failed in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and what happened in the aftermath. It really moved me and gave me an insight into race relations in the US and what it means to be poor in a developed nation. The images of bodies floating in the water and people trying to save themselves and their neighbours have really stayed with me, and the music by jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard – who also appears in the movie – is really memorable. Capturing the Friedmans, Andrew Jarecki, 2003 This felt more to me like fiction than documentary – I remember watching it and thinking, can these people be real? It’s about a father and son in Long Island who were convicted of molesting children in the 1980s. The film-maker Andrew Jarecki discovered that the family had an archive of home movies from the time, documenting how they coped with the accusations and the trial. What amazed me was the access: I’ve always been curious how Jarecki managed to persuade the Friedmans to bare their souls and let him use the videos. The result is a disturbing portrait of a very unconventional family. Grizzly Man, Werner Herzog, 2005 What I remember most from this documentary is Werner Herzog’s voice. Ostensibly this is a film about a man called Timothy Treadwell, who spent many summers living among grizzly bears in Alaska and was eventually mauled to death and eaten by an enormous brown bear. Herzog turns it into a much grander meditation on loneliness and man’s relationship with nature. Many film-makers try to be objective and avoid giving their opinions, but Herzog isn’t shy about being authoritative. When he addresses the camera directly in that strange monotone of his, it’s almost like you’re listening to the voice of God. The 3 Rooms of Melancholia, Pirjo Honkasalo, 2004 I saw this at a film festival in Amsterdam and it had a huge impact on me. It confronts you with images of war from Chechnya, with a particular focus on the children caught up in the conflict (the second Chechen war that began in 1999). It’s incredibly sad but I really liked that it didn’t try to push a war-is-bad message on you, like a Michael Moore film. It just provides testimony and lets you make up your own mind. I was also struck by the artistic nature of the film-making and how images of war and catastrophe can also be beautiful. I’m sure people had problems with that, but it meant the images stuck with me long after I saw the film. Pina, Wim Wenders, 2011 I didn’t know anything about Pina Bausch or contemporary dance before I saw this film – I only went to see it because Wim Wenders directed it. The fact that I really enjoyed it and didn’t want it to end just goes to show what power documentaries can have. Pina Bausch died just as Wenders was preparing to make a film about her, so instead he filmed her dance troupe in Germany talking about Pina and re-enacting her work. One detail I really loved was the way he disconnected the voiceovers from the images of the people who are speaking. It added to the film’s very strong emotional effect. KF Molly Dineen: ‘Adam Curtis made us look again at our own world’ Born in Canada and raised in Birmingham, documentary director and cinematographer Molly Dineen won Baftas for her 1993 series The Ark and 2007 film The Lie of the Land, and Royal Television Society awards for 1987’s Home from the Hill and 1989’s Heart of the Angel. Into Eternity, Michael Madsen, 2010 I saw this when I was on a jury at a documentary festival in Nyon, and it was really unexpected. It’s about Finland burying its nuclear waste in a deep, deep cavern, with two diggers silently burrowing into the bedrock. That’s intercut with interviews with scientists talking about how you can leave a signal for future civilisations not to go into this burial chamber. This stuff is so toxic for 100,000 years, so we’re not talking about any sort of signposting we will understand; there may be whole different ways of communication. There was something really affecting about that. And the interviews are fabulous, because they’re very unpromising – just straight-on head-and-shoulders shots of scientists – but they’re humorous and warm and compassionate. Le Joli Mai, Chris Marker and Pierre Lhomme, 1963 They showed this to us when I first went to the National Film School and I absolutely loved it. It’s about the beautiful month of May in Paris, and it starts with a voiceover by actress Simone Signoret, saying as only French people could, “It’s the most beautiful city in the world and against this set, 8 million Parisians act out a play.” And it’s this fantastic springboard into a series of observed vignettes: famous people, shopkeepers, passers-by, mothers, sons, black, white, men, women. It’s like a wonderful complex tapestry – without wanting to sound like a pillock – of life. And this was the first time France hadn’t been at war since 1939, so there’s this beautiful feeling about it. Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, Nick Broomfield And Joan Churchill, 2003 This is the last interview with Aileen Wuornos [who killed seven men in Florida in 1989-90] before she’s executed. There’s a very interesting tension as to whose film it is. She sees it as her opportunity to set the record straight, saying it was self-protection – I thought she came across well and I was incredibly moved by her situation. But on the other hand Nick and Joan are making the film about her. At the end it’s very shocking because he asks her a question she doesn’t like and she’s screaming, “fuck you, Nick”, as she’s dragged off to be executed. And yet you feel it’s something he had to ask, because I suppose in a documentary you have to have the film‑maker in charge. The Power of Nightmares, Adam Curtis, 2004 I think that Adam Curtis is a completely independent voice, and he presents situations and current affairs back to us in a radical way. The Power of Nightmares is a three-part BBC documentary where he addresses al-Qaida and the fact that it’s been very useful for governments to have something to be scared of. In the context of the whole world being terrified of al-Qaida, this made you rethink received opinion; he made us look again at our own world. I love his delivery and the way he uses archive material and music. His style is so unusual and imaginative and rich and draws on all sorts of other cultural references that we have. Sisters in Law, Kim Longinotto, 2006 This is about two female judges in Kumba, Cameroon dealing with cases of violence against women. Kim Longinotto and I work in a very similar way, so I think I appreciate her films even more. It’s difficult to immerse yourself in another culture, and in a different language, when to a European this is a very alien community. Kim always puts herself out to the nth degree: she manages to be in the right place and observe and tell the story through character. I think it’s because of her character – she’s warm, she’s humble, she’s sensible – that she relates to people so well, and boy, does it come across here. It’s a brilliant film. KB Angus Macqueen:‘Television’s contribution to the documentary form has been huge’ Angus Macqueen is a British film-maker whose latest film is The Legend of Shorty (2014), about the search for Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Other films include Gulag and The Death of Yugoslavia. Man on Wire, James Marsh, 2008 This is the story of an event in 1974, when a French tightrope-walker named Philippe Petit decided to sling a wire between the Twin Towers in New York and walk across it. It’s not an easy story to tell on film, but they did an extraordinary job. I loved the decision to shoot it like a heist movie, showing how Petit and his gang staked out the towers and set up the rope without anyone noticing. The director got across the lunatic absurdity of the whole project and the sense that Petit’s walk was not just a physical feat but also an act of art. Too often, documentaries are painful and difficult to watch, but this was a real pleasure. Little Dieter Needs to Fly, Werner Herzog, 1998 This is one of Werner Herzog’s less well-known documentaries. It’s an astonishing story about a German-American military pilot called Dieter Dengler who grew up in Germany during the second world war, then went to America, enlisted in the air force and fought in Vietnam. He crashed his plane over Laos and was taken prisoner by Laotian troops, then handed over to the Viet Cong. Herzog takes him back to revisit the whole ordeal and meet his former captors. It’s a remarkable piece of documentary film-making. Herzog later turned the story into a feature film called Rescue Dawn, which wasn’t very good. This is the one you need to see. Shoah, Claude Lanzmann, 1985 This is Claude Lanzmann’s nine-hour film about the Holocaust. My film Gulag was pretty directly inspired by it, though I would never claim to any of its greatness. What’s remarkable about Shoah is its monumentality: Lanzmann wanted to make a monument out of a documentary, and he didn’t care if you thought it was too long because the extraordinary nature of this event – the organised, mechanical destruction of human beings over an extended period of time – cannot be told in 45 minutes or an hour. It’s painful to watch but magnificently made. His meeting with Jan Karski, the Pole who reported what was going on in the Warsaw ghetto to the allied governments, is almost a film in itself. Lanzmann also finds some of the perpetrators and gets them to talk. Once you’ve seen it, it’s impossible to forget. Pandora’s Box, Adam Curtis, 1992 I think Adam Curtis is in many ways the most important documentary voice on British TV, simply because he puts across mad arguments and compels you to engage with them. This was his first series for the BBC (his best known is probably The Power of Nightmares) and his imaginative use of archive material is completely striking. The subtitle is “A Fable from the Age of Science” and it deals with a lot of things he’s fascinated by – communism, game theory, DDT, nuclear power – weaving them together in a very original way. It’s really worth seeing if you can find it. China: Beyond the Clouds, Phil Agland, 1994 This is a great documentary series made in China in the early 90s. Agland was an anthropologist and he’d already made a wonderful series in the 80s about the Baka tribe in Cameroon. For Beyond the Clouds, he spent several years in a small town in Yunnan province telling the stories of various characters he met. He focuses on normal people but in doing so tells us about China’s past as well as its present and the monumental change that was coming. It was beautifully shot, because he’s a very fine cameraman, and very memorable. Television’s contribution to the documentary form has been huge and this is television at its best.

The proposed regulations Obama will launch at the White House on Monday could cut carbon pollution by as much as 25% from about 1,600 power plants in operation today, according to those claiming familiarity with the plan. Power plants are the country's single biggest source of carbon pollution – responsible for up to 40% of the country's emissions. The rules, which were drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and are under review by the White House, are expected to do more than Obama, or any other president, has done so far to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions responsible for climate change. They will put America on course to meet its international climate goal, and put US diplomats in a better position to leverage climate commitments from big polluters such as China and India, Obama said in a speech to West Point graduates this week. “I intend to make sure America is out front in a global framework to preserve our planet,” he said. “American influence is always stronger when we lead by example. We can not exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to everyone else.” It won't be without a fight. Obama went on in his remarks at West Point to take a shot at Republicans who deny climate change is occurring, and the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, on Thursday accused critics of making “doomsday claims” about the costs of cutting carbon. But the White House still showed some signs of nervousness about a political backlash, releasing a report about expanded oil and gas production on Obama's watch and adding to the furious spinning by environmental and industry groups about the potential costs and benefits of the EPA regulations. “We actually see this … as the Super Bowl of climate politics,” said Peter Altman, director of the climate and clean air campaign for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which produced a model carbon-cutting plan that has helped guide the EPA regulations. But if all unfolds according to plan, Obama will have succeeded in overcoming blanket opposition – and outright climate denial in many cases – from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress, an industry-funded misinformation campaign, and a slew of anticipated lawsuits. Obama had originally hoped to cut carbon pollution by moving a bill through Congress. Four years after that effort fell apart, campaigners say the EPA rules could deliver significant emissions cuts – near the 17% Obama proposed at the Copenhagen climate summit – and the cap-and-trade programmes that were so reviled by Republicans. The EPA, using its authority under the Clean Air Act, proposed the first rule phase, covering future power plants, last September. In this the more politically contentious phase of the plan, it is widely believed the EPA will depart from the “inside the fence-line” convention of earlier environmental regulations for mercury and other pollutants, which focused on emissions-scrubbing on specific power plants. The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, is seeking steep reductions – as much as 25% – but she has hinted repeatedly that she will allow states latitude in how they reach those targets. The plan would allow electricity companies to reduce pollution by shutting down the oldest and most polluting coal plants. They can install carbon-sucking retrofits. They can expand wind and solar energy, upgrade the electrical grid, encourage customers to update to more efficient heating and cooling systems, or more efficient appliances and lightbulbs. “They have recognised huge emissions reductions opportunities are often cheaper than trying to do it all inside the plant,” said David Doniger, who heads the climate programme at the NRDC. “If you want to get substantial reductions and you want to get it economically, you have to take into account a system-wide approach.” The EPA to expected to try to soften the impact of the regulations by coming out with a range of targets, taking account of the energy mix in different states, and by allowing a two-step phase-in of the targets, with steeper cuts delayed until 2030. But campaigners and industry are bracing for a fight. The Chamber of Commerce, one of the major opponents of the environmental regulations, said in a report on Wednesday the EPA regulations would cost $51bn a year in higher electricity prices and lost jobs and investment – but those figures were disputed. Coal mining companies, power plant operators that are heavily dependent on coal, attorney generals in about a dozen Republican-controlled states, and conservative think tanks also argue the system-wide approach oversteps the EPA's authority, and are lining up for legal challenges. “I suspect we will see more environmental litigation as it relates to CO2 emissions going forward from a variety of sources,” said Karen Harbert, who heads the Chamber's energy institute. America's carbon dioxide emissions have been falling over the last few years to the lowest levels since the 1990s, because of a switch from coal to cheaper natural gas, and on a smaller scale increased investment in renewables. The economic downturn also reduced demand for electricity. The White House said those changes – which were mainly market-driven – showed the EPA regulations would not hurt the economy as critics claim. “We can transform our energy system to be less carbon intensive while still growing the economy,” Obama's counsellor, John Podesta, told a conference call. The EPA rules would fix those reductions in place and – as several campaigners and energy analysts noted – be a relatively easy reach for a large number of states which have already moved to cut emissions and expand wind and solar power. More than 30 states already have regulations promoting renewable energy. Minnesota and Colorado are pledged to get 30% of their power from renewables by 2020. Meanwhile, nine north-eastern states and California are already rewarding power companies which cut carbon through operating cap-and-trade systems. Those changes in the energy landscape – and an intense outreach campaign by McCarthy and other officials – could defuse of the opposition, said Paul Bledsoe, an energy consultant who served on Bill Clinton's climate change task force. “I think there is a divide between the companies,” he said. “Coal heavy companies are going to fight it tooth and nail, especially behind the scenes, legally. The more gas, nuclear and renewable-heavy companies are going to be more sanguine about it.” The EPA rules could also end up vastly expanding regional cap-and-trade programmes. Kelly Speakes-Backman, who heads the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the north-east, said she had already had quiet approaches from a number of state officials. She said the nine states in RGGI had already cut carbon dioxide emissions 40% from 2005 levels, and were aiming to halve carbon pollution by 2020. The new EPA rules would be a “game-changer” for cap-and-trade. Once Obama makes his announcement on Monday, the clock starts ticking. The EPA will have one year to take public comment from anyone from Greenpeace to Peabody Coal before finalising the new standards in June 2015. Once those rules are final, the states will have one year, or until June 2016, to submit their plans for meeting the new EPA targets. With Obama's term ending in January 2017, those are tight deadlines – especially with the legal and political battles ahead. But it does put Obama in position to fulfill the promises he made on climate change when he was first elected in 2008. “This whole suite of policies is getting us within shooting range of where we could have been with a cap-and-trade bill,” said Vicki Arroyo, who heads the climate centre at Georgetown University law school. “If the EPA is really restructuring programmes to take advantage of systems wide benefits … then that is just huge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2015/jul/20/the-guardians-labour-london-mayoral-hustings-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-20T20:46:45Z","webTitle":"The Guardian's Labour London mayoral hustings - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/jul/20/the-guardians-labour-london-mayoral-hustings-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2015/jul/20/the-guardians-labour-london-mayoral-hustings-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian's Labour London mayoral hustings - Politics live","bodyText":"If there had been a clapometer in the room, David Lammy would have probably won it. A colleague tells me there seemed to be a disproportionate number of Lammy supporters in the room, and that may explain why, but he did seem to be the candidate getting the most applause. On the minus side, he was the candidate most liable to sound a bit hectoring. But, on the plus side, he certainly pushed the right buttons. His answers on “dirty money” in the city (see 8.21pm) and on the danger posed by rising house prices (see 8.46pm) were two of the highlights of the evening. To be fair, though, the hustings had many good moments. Covering Labour leadership hustings has become a dreary, soul-destroying affair, not so much because the candidates are saying the same things (though they are), but because they seem nervous about saying anything new, and the chief interest lies in seeing how the two front-runners, Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper, align themselves closest to where they perceive the centre of political gravity in the party to be. In this contest, partly because the powers of the mayor are different, the dynamic seems quite different. An observer hearing these six for the first time would be hard pressed to place them on an ideological spectrum, and instead the debate was one about practical ideas. There are been many Labour London mayoral hustings already and the selling points of the candidates are well established. Tessa Jowell would be the Olympics mayor; the person with experience, who made the games a success. Diane Abbott’s reference point was Ken Livingstone, and she would resurrect his approach. Lammy and Sadiq Khan both highlight their upbringing, and the fact that they did not come from a privileged background. Thomas is the co-operative candidate; he is chair of the Co-operative party. And Christian Wolmar is the non-parliamentary expert, the only candidate not to have been an MP. All six stuck to these roles tonight, and when Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr said Labour supporters had a good choice, they were not just being polite. No one is saying that about the party leadership contest. Overall the tone was friendly, although it was interesting to note the snide asides. Khan was talking about Lammy when he said that he (Khan) would not build on the green belt, unlike others. Abbott had a dig at Khan, saying, unlike him, she had not changed her mind on Heathrow. But her sharpest barb was directed at Jowell. More than once she said that, unlike Jowell (the favourite), she had not just worked on stop-and-search for six months; it had been a lifelong cause. From the party’s point of view, the only drawback may have been the tendency of the candidates to agree on too much. When Wolmar said that he was not impressed by the case for a youth mayor, because the issue of youth disengagement demanded a more substantial approach, he introduced a surprise moment of dissent. (See 7.55pm.) And spare a thought for my colleague, Rafael Behr. When he suggested that the financial services industry was such a powerful revenue-raiser for the UK that a Labour mayor would not simply be able to bash it (see 8.16pm), I feared he might get lynched. None of the candidates really engaged with his point. But in the full mayoral contest, against a Conservative opponent, the successful Labour candidate will not be able to avoid this problem so easily. The panel is summing up. Polly Toynbee says Labour has a good choice. Labour voters have to think who would best stand up to the Tory candidate, probably Zac Goldsmith. Rafael Behr says Labour has a fantastic choice. But the themes did sound a bit zone 1, zone 2. He grew up in outer London, he says. There are places like Croydon that are not so Labour. Tony Travers says it will be hard for Labour to get its message about low pay over, without sound anti business. Some 85% of people in London work in the private sector. And how can the mayor make people feel a bit more empowered? That is important, he says. And that’s it. The event is over. I’ll post a summary shortly. Christian Wolmar says he agrees with Lammy; housing is the key issue. He mentions a worker on his campaign; if we cannot ensure people like Dan can find a home, then London will never thrive. Gareth Thomas says we need to build more communities. He takes his inspiration from Coin Street community builders. In the Oxo tower, beneath the restaurant, there are five floors of social housing. They set their own rents. He says he would also like to see more credit unions, and a credit union bank. He agrees with Jowell about the Olympics. But it was in the past. London should host a Commonwealth games. Diane Abbott says the mayor should bring people together. In a reference to David Cameron’s speech today, she says she is wary of anything that stigmatises Muslims. Q: What would you do to make London more neighbourly? Sadiq Khan says there are some things even the best politician cannot do. But they can help to make a difference. He says he does not accept that London is unfriendly. After 7/7, people predicted a backlash. But it did not happen. Ken Livingstone reminded us London should be united. Tessa Jowell says she has been talking about one London in her campaign. During the Olympics we saw London as an open city, welcoming people around the world. But we should never forget that some of the unhappiest Londoners are young people, shut out from the opportunities. David Lammy says the challenge is to keep London a city of mixed communities. If you drive people out through gentrification, then London will lost out. High rents militate against neighbourliness. So the biggest challenge for the next mayor is housing. If people are buying flats off plan from Hong Kong or Singapore, they should pay extra. He says everyone on the panel owns a home worth more than £750,000; his office has checked. The mayor should do something for ordinary Londoners.] This gets a large round of applause - perhaps the biggest we’ve heard all night. Gareth Thomas says it is not just a matter for the police; he would like to see the CPS prosecuting more of these offences. He is glad Met officers are now wearing body cameras. Under George Osborne’s cuts, thousands of Met posts will go. That is why London should have power over tax. Londoners did not vote for austerity, he says. Diane Abbott says, at the top, Met officers take issues like this very seriously. The problem relates to middle ranking officers, she says. She says the pornification culture is creating problems. The average age at which boys are exposed to hardcore pornography is now eight, she says. Christian Wolmar says the Met is too big. It should be broken up. There should be a force just dealing with London; counter-terrorism should be separate. And there should be more manned stations. Q: What would you do to ensure women are safer on public transport? Sadiq Khan says he has two daughters; he feels strongly about this. He would tell the Met to make this a priority. David Lammy says there is a lot that needs to be done to improve the Met. There are many dangers in the home, where people are being sexualised through the internet. Rape, domestic violence and sexual violence is on the increase. We need a Met that reflects the city, but we need more public education too. Assaults against men are an issue too. Tessa Lammy says only 15% of the Met are BAME. That is completely disproportionate for London. On the Tube, we should stop having posters asking women about being “beach ready”. In the past the Met has not taken rape seriously enough. The incidence of rape is increasing; in some case, that is to do with people being more willing to report it. She says the work that she and Harriet Harman did to persuade the Met to take sexual crime seriously sent “shockwaves” through the force. Sadiq Khan says corporate social responsibility should not just be a box to be ticked. Finance is all well and good, he says. But we need more tech jobs in London, and more manufacturing jobs. It is important for London to be pro-Europe. Zac Goldsmith, the potential Tory mayor, is anti-Europe. Christian Wolmar says he likes the idea of a Robin Hood tax. No one has mentioned the Corporation of London. Labour used to be committed to incorporating it into London. He would like that to happen. He went to to see the Corporation recently; they can spend £250m, with little control. He would like to get his hands on that money. Gareth Thomas says he comes from the Co-op tradition in Labour. He is interested in promoting community shares. There is a need for more transparency, he says. The City should aim to become the most trusted financial centre in the world. And that relies on a better relationship with Londoners, which in turn depends on more investment in things like social housing. The City needs “tough love”. He would like to see the mayor sitting on the Prudential Regulation Authority. Q: Would you be willing to buy shares in big businesses and turn up at the AGM to push for change? And do you support the Robin Hood tax? David Lammy says he supports a financial transaction tax. And he has brought shares in a company and turned up at its AGM to push for change. He did that with Tottenham. He says there is a lot of dirty money flowing through the city. And it is unacceptable for Google to make billions from London, but only pay about £11m in tax. And it is unacceptable for Uber to be running cabs in London, but not paying tax. Tessa Jowell says she agrees with the point on Uber. That is why she does not have an Uber account. And she says Lammy is right about Russian money coming to his country, from dubious sources, and being deposited in London property. She would do everything she could as London mayor to get HM Revenue and Customs to tackle this. Diane Abbott jokes that she is not trying to out-left Tessa Jowell on this. The City want to address issues like housing, she says. That happened when Ken Livingstone was mayor. She says Jowell said she worked on stop-and-search for six months; she has worked on that all her life, she says. She says that is what you do when you worry about your son being picked up by the police. Rafael Behr says none of the candidates mentioned the financial services industry. Yet the mayor of London in the past has found himself becoming an advocate for the City. He says he would be interested to see whether any of these candidates would stand up to the City. The City is an important part of the national economy, he says. He says he hopes that Tessa Jowell is right about settled pay differentials becoming the norm, but he has not seen the evidence for this. Christian Wolmar says the mayor has limited power. But the mayor could insist that firms that get contracts with London publish information about their pay differentials. And the mayor could only offer contracts to firms paying the living wage. David Lammy says he pressed Tottenham, the football club in his constituency, to pay the living wage to all their staff. That made a difference, and they are now doing that. The mayor has a bully pulpit, he says. The mayor can and should campaign on this, he says. Sadiq Khan says the mayor should have the power to set a London living wage. It should be £10 an hour. Paying it improves productivity, he says. He says the current head of Transport for London earns around £650,000. His replacement should earn less, he says. He says he wants to be the most pro-business mayor ever. But he wants to be a living wage mayor too. It is possible to do both, he says. Q: Is top pay too high in London? And, if it is, what would you do about it? Diane Abbott says in her lifetime the multiple between the lowest and the highest paid in a business has widened enormously. She would roll out a London living wage, not just for those employed by London, but in the hope of setting an example too. As for wages at the top, that is something to campaign on. That is a key role for the mayor. Tessa Jowell says she is comfortable with people being rich if they act as citizens of London. But she is not happy with people buying flats as “gold bars”. She is a trained organiser with London Citizens, she says. She would push for a London minimum wage. In 10 years time it will be odd if a ratio between the highest paid and the lowest paid does not exist. Firms that do stick to a settled high paid/low paid ratio show the most resilience. So this makes good business sense too. Gareth Thomas says you cannot be comfortable with levels of high pay. He is the only candidate saying London should have the power to set income tax, he says. He wants there to be a referendum on this in September 2016. He thinks London should have the power to cap rents too. David Lammy says he would like to set up a process that would enable young people to audit the GLA’s budget. Services for young people have been cut. And there is a spike in knife crime. That is because the organisations that keep young people off the streets are being cut. Sadiq Khan says it would be the middle class kids who would get involved. He has nothing against that, but he would like to reach out to people on council estates. He has been working with #DareToDream, to get young people involved in his policy making. Tessa Jowell says she would have a young mayor. But you need these initiatives to make you feel uncomfortable. She has been working with Doreen Lawrence on alternatives to stop and search. They worked with young people, and as a result came up with ideas that she would not previously have considered. She says you need young people beside you a lot; she always had work experience students in her parliamentary office, and learnt a great deal from them. Q: How will you involve children and young people in decision making in London? Would you have a young mayor? Diane Abbott says young mayors in boroughs have been a success. There should be a young London mayor, and a young London assembly too. Gareth Thomas says it is a great idea. The youth parliament has been a success. Christian Wolmar says he is slightly sceptical about this. The biggest problem with democracy is that young people do not vote. The general election result would have been very different if young people had voted as heavily as old people. So it is more important to make a bigger drive to get young people to vote. Parties should have youth parties, he says. Tessa Jowell says the cultural Olympics were a success. And her 10 things do do before you are 10 would encourage children to get better access to the arts. David Lammy says 30 years ago he was a young Alud Jones. Ilea funded a scholarship for him to sing in the Peterborough Cathedral choir. It was his Billy Elliott moment. We need to encourage the arts. Artists are now leaving London, and going to cities like Berlin instead, he says. Diane Abbott says fine art is important; she used to drag her son to museums. But she would also like to use the arts and culture to bind people together. Q: [From someone from the New Direction arts group] Would you support moves to give all children experience of the arts? Sadiq Khan quotes Oscar Wilde on knowing the price of everything, but the value of nothing. His father, a bus driver, used to make a point of going to art galleries, which were then free. He says in his constituency the Polka theatre gives families the chance to take their children to the theatre. But now it is not just poor families who cannot afford the arts; some middle class families cannot afford theatre either. Quality of life is very important. Christian Wolmar says all the candidates would support this idea, but finding the funding is difficult. The mayor can steer things in the right direction. Gareth Thomas says he has a six-month-old daughter. He wants her to grow up as an Arsenal fan, and a Welsh rugby fan. But he wants her to enjoy the arts too. London should bid to be the European city of culture. And that bid should be based on outer London, because that is where cultural events are most under attack. And the best art from young Londoners should be hosted in Buckingham Palace, he says. David Lammy says he would have 1,000 play streets in his first term. But the issue is wider, he says. Young people are being penalised in many ways, he says. He cites, in particular, the 50% cut to further education colleges. It is important to make London a good place to grow up, he says. Sadiq Khan says he used to play cricket in the street. He was inspired by the Big Lunch initiative. That was another way of using streets, he says. It led to neighbours meeting for the first time. He would sell off Boris Johnson’s water cannon to fund youth services. But he says, with play space being an issue, he would not sell of parts of the green belt. Diane Abbott says there are play streets in Hackney. They work well, and they are good for child support too. Next question. Q: Streets account for 80% of London space, but they are reserved for cars. Would you support a drive to create 10,000 play streets? Christian Wolmar says this is one of his ideas. In his own street there has been an attempt to block off the street at one end. Streets used to be used for all sorts of things; he would like to bring that back. He thinks 20mph should be the default speed limit. He would use the £30m that Boris Johnson has allocated for the garden bridge for this. Gareth Thomas says all the candidates are opposed to the garden bridge. He supports the 10,000 play street idea. But how do you fund it? Councils are strapped for cash. So he would bring in a hotel occupancy tax. Tessa Jowell says today she announced a plan for children’s activities, 10 things do do before they are 10. That would be funded partly by a voluntary charge on hotels. Polly Toynbee says it is interesting to hear the candidates pinching each other’s best ideas; that is a good reason for having these hustings. Tessa Jowell says by 2035 the centre of London should be car free. The only vehicles allowed by then should be electric vehicles. She says she would also like to stop daytime deliveries, something that happened during the Olympics. And she would like to close Oxford Street; over time, that should be extended, to Regent Street and Covent Garden. London should be a walking city. And she would like air pollution monitors at buggy height. Diane Abbott says air pollution should be a priority. Ordinary people should take ownership of this. In Hackney, she was involved in a project putting solar panels on people’s homes; they got cut-price electricity. There should be a lower emission zone. And she has not changed her mind on a third runway; she has always opposed it, she says. She says she has been a fraction more consistent than some of the other candidates. Christian Wolmar says one of the reasons he entered the contest was to give it a green edge. He has seen the other candidates moving into his territory. For example, pedestrianising Oxford Street - he first wrote about that in 1998. But it is not just about that. It is about having a different sort of city. Hugh Muir says Wolmar sounds a bit mayoral; Ken Livingstone used to say if he heard a good idea, he would nick it. (Hugh does a good Ken accent.) Q: What would you do to tackle air pollution in London? David Lammy says most pollution is occurs when parents are taking their kids to school. We need to encourage more children to walk to school. If that means more lollipop ladies, so be it. But we need a strict emission zone, and we need to encourage more cycling. And we need to ban HGVs during peak hours. Sadiq Khan says air quality last year killed 10,000 Londoners. Doctors say some days it is not safe to job in London. That is why he has changed his mind, and does not support a third runway at Heathrow. We need more cycling And we need to pedestrianise Oxford Street. People need to be able to walk to work and cycle to work. Gareth Thomas says the congestion charge should be refined, so that it is based on emissions. He disagrees with Khan on Heathrow, he says. It is surface transport to Heathrow which poses the problem. We need to encourage more people onto public transport. And he backs more solar energy. Hugh Muir asks the first question. But I missed the reply because my typing was too loud for the person next to me in the audience. I’ve found a better spot now. Hugh Muir is on stage now introducing the six candidates. And we’ve got three more people on the panel. Two Guardian columnists, Polly Toynbee and Rafael Behr, and Tony Travers, the academic and local government expert. I’m at the hall in Kings Place where the hustings is about to start. There must be nearly 200 people here. The room is almost full. Guardian Live are hosting a hustings this evening at Kings Place (where the Guardian is based) for the six candidates seeking the Labour nomination for next year’s London mayoral election. My colleague Hugh Muir is chairing. The six candidates are: Tessa Jowell Sadiq Khan David Lammy Diane Abbott Gareth Thomas Christian Wolmar Here is my colleague Dave Hill’s account of the first Labour London mayoral hustings. In the piece, Dave also summarises some recent polling. Jowell’s team is stressing the findings of two new YouGov polls of London voters, one of which was conducted for Prospect. This found that 30% of respondents thought Jowell would make a good mayor, compared with 18% who felt the same way about each of Khan, Lammy and Abbott (Wolmar and Thomas were not included). The other poll, for the Evening Standard, asked a different question: which contender “would be the best Labour candidate”? In this case, Wolmar and Thomas were included. Again, Jowell came top, this time with 15% followed by Khan with 10% and Lammy and Abbott each with 6%. Another question in the same survey sought views on theoretical mayoral showdowns with Goldsmith. If Jowell were his Labour opponent, 35% said they’d prefer her compared with 26% who’d pick the Tory. Asked to imagine Khan taking Goldsmith on, the latter’s score rose to 29% while Khan’s was exactly the same. All encouraging for Jowell. As YouGov’s Peter Kellner writes, she currently reaches parts of the London electorate that others haven’t yet. A Khan supporter, however, points out that their man has gained on Jowell in the part of the poll for the Standard showing support among all respondents, including “don’t knows”, who defined themselves as Labour supporters. At the end of March, Jowell led Khan by double figures on this measure. In the new poll, she heads him by just three. If that’s a reflection of how the Labour “selectorate” is feeling it could bode well for Khan in the candidate race, the argument goes, and if he won it everything else would change. Well, maybe and maybe not and maybe somewhere in between. And maybe all of the above means nothing much at all. “Don’t knows” and “none of these” figure prominently in both polls. Still all to play for, comrades. The hustings starts at 7pm. I will be covering it live."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/09/climate-fight-wont-wait-for-paris-vive-la-resistance","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-09T14:03:57Z","webTitle":"Climate fight won't wait for Paris: vive la résistance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/09/climate-fight-wont-wait-for-paris-vive-la-resistance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/09/climate-fight-wont-wait-for-paris-vive-la-resistance","fields":{"headline":"Climate fight won't wait for Paris: vive la résistance","bodyText":"The official view: all eyes are on Paris, where negotiators will meet in December for a climate conference that will be described as “the most important diplomatic gathering ever” and “a last chance for humanity.” Heads of state will jet in, tense closed-door meetings will be held, newspapers will report that negotiations are near a breaking point, and at the last minute some kind of agreement will emerge, hailed as “a start for serious action”. The actual story: what happens at Paris will be, at best, one small part of the climate story, one more skirmish in the long, hard-fought road to climate sanity. What comes before and after will count more. And to the extent Paris matters, its success will depend not on the character of our leaders but on how much a resurgent climate movement has softened up the fossil fuel industry, and how much pressure the politicians feel to deliver something. The good news is, that pressure is growing. In fact, that relentless climate movement is starting to win big, unprecedented victories around the world, victories which are quickly reshaping the consensus view – including among investors – about how fast a clean energy future could come. It’s a movement grounded in the streets and reaching for the photovoltaic rooftops, and its thinking can be easily summarised in a mantra: Fossil freeze. Solar thaw. Keep it in the ground. Triumph is not certain – in fact, as the steadily rising toll of floods and droughts and melting glaciers makes clear, major losses are guaranteed. But for the first time in the quarter-century since global warming became a major public issue the advantage in this struggle has begun to tilt away from the Exxons and the BPs and towards the ragtag and spread-out fossil fuel resistance, which is led by indigenous people, young people, people breathing the impossible air in front-line communities. The fight won’t wait for Paris – the fight is on every day, and on every continent. Consider, first, the fossil freeze On 24 February, Barack Obama vetoed Congressional attempts to force the construction of the Keystone pipeline – a proposed pipeline to transport oil from Alberta in Canada to refineries on the US gulf coast. Four years ago, a poll of DC energy insiders found that 91% thought Transcanada (the Canadian company that wants to build the pipeline) would quickly and easily acquire the permit for the pipeline; the company was so confident that they mowed the strip they were about to dig up across the centre of the country. But that easily-explained arrogance (no infrastructure project like this had ever been stopped before) ran into a indefatigable band of Native Americans, farmers, and climate scientists and activists, who in record numbers went to jail, filed public comments, and generally refused to buckle. Already their pressure has forced the cancellation of $17bn in new Canadian tar sands projects, and another big project was shelved last month. The oil industry continues to press for Keystone, offering increasingly frantic promises of good behaviour on carbon from Canada if only they’re allowed to build this one last pipe. Those last-minute bargains could still save the day for the tar sands—so far the president has merely rejected Congressional efforts to force his hand, not ruled on the permit itself. But if Obama says no later this winter, it will be a landmark moment. And in any event, the bigger effect has been to embolden opponents of every kind of carbon-intensive new infrastructure. Tar sands pipelines across Canada are now hopelessly snarled by First Nations activists. Valiant local organisers in upstate New York forced the powerful governor, Andrew Cuomo, to ban fracking – a ban that has now spread to Scotland and Wales, with much of England up in arms as well. You can’t frack in France, and Tasmania just added its own moratorium. In the Algerian Sahara thousands are waging a relentless battle against the technology, and their arguments about wasting water are resonating loudly in California as well, where governor Jerry Brown is under intense pressure as his state’s record drought deepens. Oil and gas – but also coal. Two years ago, on the west coast of the US, developers proposed building six giant coal ports. As America began cutting its use of coal, they planned on essentially shipping Wyoming’s Powder river basin – a huge coal deposit and site of the world’s largest coal mine – to China for easy combustion. So far, though, campaigners have forced cancellation of four of the ports, and the other two are on the ropes. In Australia, which also boasts massive coal deposits, plans for the world’s largest mine in the Galilee Valley are foundering after the ruling party suffered a massive defeat in Queensland polls, throwing government subsidies for the mine into question. The fight comes with huge international implications – its Indian owners want to ship the coal back to the subcontinent where the new government has planned to double coal consumption. But fresh data shows the subcontinent with the world’s dirtiest air, and one Indian in six dying of indoor and outdoor air pollution –internal resistance to more coal is rising fast, just as in China. In Sompeta, in Andhra Pradesh, southern India, for instance, a six-year campaign (which left two activists dead from police gunfire) has now blocked a huge thermal coal plant. The fossil fuel resistance, like the fossil fuel industry, is protean and sprawling – and each win reverberates for decades to come, because that’s how long pipelines and coal mines are built to last. Wins in 2015 shift the landscape in 2055. That’s why, if politicians want to lead, they need to stop new fossil fuel development now. A piece of paper explaining what should happen 20 years from now is easier for them to sell, but atmospheric chemistry is unimpressed. Hilary Clinton, to name one example, says the right things about the dangers of climate change, but she’s backed Keystone from the start – a pointless combination. With the help of feckless politicians the world around the industry still wins its share of fights too – the rapid spread of fracking across the Dakotas and Texas has boosted Obama’s US past the Saudis and Russians to become the world’s largest oil and gas producer, for instance. Fighting one pipeline at a time, the industry will eventually prevail. That’s why the climate movement has left its usual defensive crouch and started playing offense too, trying to freeze the pipeline of capital that sustains the industry. The campaign to force institutions to sell their fossil fuel stocks – which an Oxford study described as the fastest growing divestment campaign ever – has rolled up significant victories. Universities from Stanford to Sydney have started offloading their shares. At first the industry feigned unconcern – “someone else will buy the shares,” their lobbyists said with a patronising smile. Silly kids. But the divestment movement never thought it could bankrupt BP in the short term. Instead: intellectual, moral, and political bankruptcy. Campaigners had a story to tell, one based on compelling new math first compiled by London’s Carbon Tracker Initiative. Their figures – based on SEC filings, annual reports, and other official data – showed that the fossil fuel industry had in its proven reserves four times as much carbon as scientists thought we could burn and still have a hope of keeping temperature rise below 2C. (Given that 1C of warming has melted the Arctic, 2C is a target for fools – at this point, however, that’s as reasonable a label for us as Homo sapiens.) Once you knew those numbers you could never think the same way about Shell again. The fossil fuel companies (and the countries – think Kuwait – that operate as fossil fuel companies) are rogues. If they carry out their announced business plans, they break the planet. The math is so basic and easy that it’s quickly carried the day. What in 2013 was the rallying cry of a few student campaigners has by 2015 become the conventional wisdom: there’s a “carbon bubble,” composed of the trillions of dollars of coal and oil and gas that simply must be left underground. Here’s the president of World Bank speaking in Davos: “Use smart due diligence. Rethink what fiduciary responsibility means in this changing world. It’s simple self-interest. Every company, investor and bank that screens new and existing investments for climate risk is simply being pragmatic.” Those radicals at HSBC, in between sheltering taxes for the super-rich, ran the numbers: if the world actually tried to keep its 2C commitment, valuations of the fossil fuel industry would drop by half. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, did his best to explain the unwelcome news to the industry at a conference last October: the “vast majority” of the planet’s carbon reserves “are unburnable,” he said. When Shell’s chief executive hit back last month, calling a rapid transition off fossil fuel “simply naïve,” it was Tory veteran and chair of parliament’s energy committee Tim Yeo who told him off: “I do believe the problem of stranded assets is a real one now. Investors are starting to think by 2030 the world will be in such a panic about climate change that either by law or by price it will be very hard to burn fossil fuels on anything like the scale we are doing at the moment.” Forget sea level rise for a moment – this is a sea change, happening in real time before our eyes, as the confidence in an old order starts to collapse. Last September the members of the Rockefeller family – the first family of fossil fuels – announced that they were divesting their philanthropies from coal, oil, and gas for reasons “both moral and economic”. As the head of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund put it, “We are quite convinced that if John D Rockefeller were alive today, as an astute businessman looking out to the future, he would be moving out of fossil fuels and investing in clean, renewable energy.” This is the rough equivalent of the Pope appearing at his Vatican window in saffron robes to tell the crowd below he’s now a Hare Krishna, or Richard Dawkins showing up at Lourdes in a bathing suit. The fossil fuel industry – facing a serious challenge for the first time in its 300-year run – has tried to pretend it’s not happening. They’re just a year or two removed from record profits, and they keep producing internal forecasts showing that the world will stick with fossil fuels for decades to come (forecasts that caused Shell and BP, among others, to dump their tiny renewables divisions and double down on hydrocarbons). Here’s Exxon, for instance, arguing that divestment campaigners are fools because the company’s “estimates suggest that wind, solar, and geothermal will make up no more than 4% of the global energy supply by 2040.” Shell was blunter still: “We do not believe that any of our proven reserves will become stranded.” Increasingly they’ve fallen back on public relations, with some companies funding a PR guru named Rick Berman, who once worked for the tobacco industry and who promised at a secretly videotaped industry meeting to wage “endless war” against environmentalists. But their great offensive has been a damp squib, consisting mostly of lecturing greens that we can’t “turn off fossil fuels overnight”. A highlight, produced by Berman in the lead-up to Global Divestment Day, was a minute-long cartoon about a boy whose girlfriend was a barrel of oil till his enviro friends convinced him to break up with her – at which point he could no longer use his cellphone, or eat food, or do much of anything else. (It features my floating disembodied head as a leering demon). No one thinks, of course, that we will get off fossil fuel overnight; there’s a couple of hundred years worth of infrastructure guaranteeing it will take a while. And of course the industry argument, if true, is a good one. Even facing catastrophic global warming, we’re not going to stop using energy. In the face of that brute fact, a fossil freeze might seem like so much posturing. Which is where the solar thaw comes in. Because the fossil fuel industry faces a closing pincers. Month by month, activists hold up its expansion and damage its reputation. And month by month engineers undercut its rationale. The price of solar panels has dropped 75% in the past six years, and now the “soft costs” of putting them on your roof is falling just as fast – Deutschebank estimates they’ll be 40% less expensive in the next two years. Exxon thinks, in their Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 report, that wind and sun will supply 4% of the world’s power in 2040? The Danes got 40% of their juice from wind turbines last year, and sadly for the fossil fuel industry Denmark has no monopoly on wind. There were days last summer when the Germans got 80% of their electricity from solar panels – and Germany, on average, gets as much sunshine as Alaska. The fastest gains will be made where energy is needed most, across the sun-rich tropics. I saw the first solar panel ever installed in Bangladesh, a single panel atop a village schoolhouse roof that went up sometime in the late 1990s. By now Bangladesh has 15m solar arrays, and 60,000 new homes a month come on line: the nation plans to be entirely solarised by 2020. When the Indian state of Aandhra Pradesh put out a tender offer for new power last October, the winning bid came from a big solar farm – at two cents a kilowatt hour less than the cost of importing coal. The erosion is happening at both ends of the technological scale: Indian peasants are powering their cellphones with the extra power generated by the solar panels that runs the cellphone towers themselves. And Apple is building giant data centres in California, Denmark, and Ireland that run entirely on renewables. Investors see where the growth will come: Tesla, which produced 2,500 cars a month last year, now carries half the valuation of General Motors, which produced 300 times as many. As the electric car fleet expands, the demand for oil will start to dwindle, and there will be an ever-larger number of four-wheeled batteries to rejigger the grid. None of the problems the fossil fuel players keep predicting for renewables seem decisive. Yes, the sun goes down at night, but that tends to be when the wind kicks up. We’re learning to store peak power in all kinds of ways: a California auction for new power supply was won by a company that uses extra solar energy to freeze ice, which then melts during the day to supply power. The smart meters now coming on line around the world allow utilities to juggle demand, turning off your water heater when its not needed. Wise companies have either seen the future or learned their lesson: E.ON, Germany’s biggest utility, announced last year that it will now focus on wind and sun. “We are the first to resolutely draw the conclusion from the change of the energy world,” chief executive Johannes Teyssen told reporters in Dusseldorf. “We’re convinced that energy companies will have to focus on one of the two energy worlds if they want to be successful.” Most utility executives aren’t so far-seeing, of course – in the US, for instance, many are coping with the threat posed by solar power by trying to make it prohibitively expensive for customers to put panels on their rooftops, a strategy embraced by the Koch Brothers. But the pushback is coming not just from enviros but from Tea Party conservatives – a “Green Tea” coalition has had success even in Deep South bastions like Georgia. As national Tea Party founding member Debbie Dooley puts it: “This is about the freedom to choose and create your own electricity.” Polls show that even people who doubt the climate is changing instinctively understand the pleasure of controlling their own energy destiny. Even large elements of the labour movement are coming to understand the appeal of renewable energy, where jobs are growing far faster than in the economy as a whole (and where the profits don’t end up funding your bitterest enemies, like the Koch Brothers). The best news, of course, is that the new renewables make the most sense in the developing world, where whole nations are poised to leapfrog past coal just as they went straight to mobile phones. They’ll need money to make that happen – which is why the most crucial decisions at Paris may be about providing financing for poor nations – but they’ve got the crucial ingredient: sunshine. And so the race is fully, finally on. There are three teams. Team one, in the green: that’s the climate justice activists and the solar engineers, working together, scrappy but gaining. Team two, in the red as the price of oil drops: that’s the fossil fuel industry. It has a big lead, but a big gut too; it’s tiring fast. And the third? That’s physics, the most mysterious of the contestants, and arguably the most important. So far physics has meant that a single degree of global warming was enough to melt most Arctic ice. Last year the California heatwave lifted 63tn gallons of groundwater from the drought-stricken state, allowing its main mountain range to jump half an inch skyward. The heavy groundwater was depressing the Earth’s crust so when it evaporated in the drought, the land rebounded upwards. The world’s sea levels are now rising inexorably, turning every storm and high tide into peril. It’s happening faster and scarier than we thought a quarter-century ago when I wrote the first book for a general audience about all this. Had we acted a quarter century ago, physics would be working on our side by now. We could have acted from a sense of justice, since global warming’s inherent unfairness – that those who contributed the least suffer the most – has been obvious from the start. Or we could have acted, you know, rationally: every economist, left, right and centre, has said for a generation that it makes no sense to let the fossil fuel companies pour their carbon out for free, and that the economic mess we’re creating far outweighs the cost of preventing it. But this fight, as it took me too long to figure out, was never going to be settled on the grounds of justice or reason. We won the argument, but that didn’t matter: like most fights it was, and is, about power. The richest industry in human history wants to keep on their current path for a few more years, even if it means dragging the whole planet over a cliff. (Never forget for a moment that this industry, having watched the Arctic melt, immediately set out to drill the newly open waters for more oil.) Their power lies in money and the political favour it can buy; our power lies in movement-building, and the political fear it can instill. They know they’re in a tough spot so they’re spending like crazy (the Koch Brothers, party of two, just announced plans to dump $900m on the next US election, which is more than the Republicans or the Democrats will spend). We’ve therefore got to organise like crazy. And if we do we have a chance. The Copenhagen climate summit was a fiasco, but not because the science wasn’t clear – in 2009, too, the world had just come off a record hot year. Copenhagen was a fiasco because environmentalists were hopeful that our leaders would do the right thing. Not this time – we’ll push as hard as we possibly can, and if we do then good things will happen before Paris, after Paris, and for years to come. Our task is brutally hard and painfully simple: keep the carbon in the ground.

And as urbanisation in India surges, living conditions in these poor areas within megacities have become increasingly dire. New slums have emerged on the outer rings of older ones, resulting in situations like the one in Mumbai's Dharavi where its one million people now sit on what many Indian leaders regard as prime real estate. Having spent time in some of the slums of Mumbai and Delhi earlier this year, I found it was easy to focus on the jarring first impressions: the overcrowding, filth and poverty. But peel back the harsh veneer and one sees the budding social enterprises that thrive in Mumbai's M Ward and Delhi's Holumbi Khurd. New business models from large and small firms alike that foster jobs, conserve resources and inspire innovation thrive within these neighbourhoods. The scarcity of resources like water and energy force residents to become creative, thrifty and share with their neighbours. Clearly these districts have their problems: inadequate healthcare, lack of clean water, scant opportunities in education and government indifference all contribute to the taxing daily life of most of their inhabitants. But the lack of necessities inspires social innovation, allowing many residents of these areas to progress while finding employment and, in the long run, hope. While these neighbourhoods are not necessarily models for sustainable development, what has unfolded in many of India's cities offer lessons for other cities around the world as they struggle with the influx of new migrants. Energy, water and health are just a few sectors in which necessity and creativity converge to improve lives and create new jobs. Dharavi, for example, has long been a hub for recycling, which in turn provides economic opportunities to tens of thousands of residents. Most of the trash Mumbai's 21 million people discard ends up at dumps near Dharavi, where \"ragpickers\" sort through the garbage and salvage plastic from everything imaginable including electronics and broken toys. The work is tedious and even dangerous, but at a daily wage averaging $3 to $5, the pay is comparable to those who make a living making the country's much-coveted and intricate sari fabric, which often involves even longer days in cramped and stuffy rooms. Recycling, however, is old school compared to what is catching on in other areas. Many of India's slums have no access to the local energy grid, which have forced residents to rely on pricey, dirty and dangerous kerosene. One social enterprise in Bangalore shuns the debate over whether India should build more coal-fired or even nuclear power plants. Pollinate Energy has provided solar energy to millions of poor Indians at a time when the cost of energy from the sun has declined precipitously. The company provides training to locals, or \"micro-entrepreneurs,\" who buy locally-manufactured solar home lighting systems and then sell them to families who would otherwise depend on kerosene for light. Families in turn have access to microfinance programmes, eliminating any requirement to purchase the contraption up front. Safe drinking water is also a leading health challenge for many of India's urban poor, and now multinationals and small social enterprises alike respond to the problem. One local company, Sarvajal, has created the \"Water ATM\", a stand-alone water dispenser that uses off-grid solar energy to power a reverse osmosis system and provides treated water 24 hours a day at a low cost. Users simply swipe a pre-paid card at a price Sarvajal claims is cheaper than other alternatives. The company trains franchisees so they can own and operate these water ATMs, giving a sense of ownership within local communities instead of relying on local charities or governments to truck in water, the norm in most Indian slums. Sarvajal received a contract last year to run a pilot programme in Delhi. Meanwhile, Unilever is an example of how a multinational can expand access to safe water to the poor while creating jobs. The company's PureIt brand of water filter, priced at $24, is a cheaper alternative than boiling water on a kerosene stove. And for consumers too poor to pay for the system entirely upfront, Unilever's India division works with several NGOs on micro-finance schemes, including one with a Facebook page that allows anyone to make contributions from as little as 10p, so these filtration systems can reach homes where they are most needed. Technology companies can also deliver services providing critical healthcare and employment. In Bhiwandi, a poor neighbourhood east of Mumbai, Microsoft partners with the Indian firm BigTech and the charity Operation ASHA to deliver tuberculosis medicine to patients who either forget or are too weak to go to local clinics for their scheduled treatments. ASHAs, or accredited social health activists, are local women trained to participate in similar health programmes throughout India and serve as the first line of healthcare support to India's poorest citizens. Dimagi, a Massachusetts-based software firm, partners with charities in the state of Uttar Pradesh to work with ASHAs who use mobile telephones to diagnose medical conditions and offer health advice to pregnant women. Technology and social innovation will not solve India's poverty and health problems alone. A government more responsive to its citizens needs would certainly help solve the growing disparity between rich and poor, but for now social entrepreneurs fill a void where a dismissive government and overwhelmed charities fall short.

The inequity arises because the cost of the hugely expensive network of \"poles and wires\" needed to guarantee uninterrupted power supply during massive short-term spikes in demand – for example when air conditioners are turned on during heatwaves – is spread evenly across all users. Research by the Centre for Policy Development released late last year concluded that the 30% of Australians without air conditioners are subsidising the cost of the electricity network needed only to supply power to those with air conditioners by at least $250 a year. A similar study by the Productivity Commission, which also took into account the cost of generating the power, put the effective subsidy at $350 a year. Grattan Institute energy program director Tony Wood says the solution has to include some form of differentiated pricing, with the portion of an electricity bill earmarked to pay for the distribution network no longer levied uniformly per unit of power used, but increased for those who routinely use more power at times of peak demand, for example homes with multiple air conditioners. “The current system is unfair,” he says, likening it to building a multi-lane highway across the Sydney Harbour bridge so there were never traffic jams even at peak hour but charging everyone, whether they used it or not. But tariff reform, which will be canvassed in the government’s forthcoming energy white paper, enters dangerous political territory. With network costs now comprising about 45% of the average household bill, spreading them out more equitably across users could have a much bigger impact on bills, both up and down, than the proposed repeal of the carbon tax, which added on average a one-off increase of 9% or about $200 a year for the typical home. According to the Energy Supply Association of Australia (ESAA), 73% of Australian homes had an air conditioner in 2011 compared with 35% in 1999. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia found that air conditioners bought for $1,500 frequently imposed a $7,000 cost on the energy system. The inequitable increase in electricity costs has been exacerbated by the huge uptake of rooftop solar panels, the ESAA and the Grattan Institute argue, because solar households avoid the high network charges levied evenly across units of power used, but actually demand power from the grid just as much during those peak times which contribute most to the costs of the network. “Households with solar end up paying less for the network because they generate some of their own electricity and import less from the grid. But solar households can be among the biggest users of the networks, because they both import and export electricity at different times of the day,” ESAA says in a discussion paper titled \"Who pays for solar energy?\". “Most solar households end up only paying a fraction of their fair share of the cost of maintaining the network. They’re not doing it deliberately, it’s just the way the billing arrangements for electricity were set up, long before rooftop solar reached the scale we see today.” But in a study for the Australian PV network, the Centre for Policy Development found that solar photo-voltaic panels actually reduced the cross subsidy because to whatever extent solar is operating during times of high demand, it reduces that demand. The ESAA and the Grattan Institute say that if the government does nothing, power bills could rise even further as the market enters a “death spiral” – where fewer customers are forced to pay the high fixed costs of the electricity network, encouraging even more customers to turn to rooftop solar to reduce their bills, increasing still further the inequity in the electricity billing system. “An increasing proportion of consumers no longer pay their fair share of network costs,” ESAA said in another discussion paper titled “Air conditioners and solar: why electricity pricing needs to be reformed”. It says Queensland, with its high uptake of both air conditioners and rooftop solar, could already be in the early stages of a “death spiral” as a result of the current system – where higher bills push still more households to take up rooftop solar. In its report “Shock to the system: dealing with falling electricity demand”, the Grattan Institute identified the same problem. “For residential customers, rapid uptake of air conditioners has increased peak load on the network and pushed up prices for other users. By allowing some users to reduce the amount they pay in network charges without reducing the costs they impose on the network, rooftop solar has also pushed up prices. All these changes give customers even more incentives to reduce consumption. The possible long-term result is a ‘death spiral’. “The ‘death spiral’ is a term used to describe the situation where declining demand, technology changes and rising prices may interact in a way that induces large numbers of consumers to disconnect from the network. In that case the whole funding model of Australia’s regulated power networks is under threat ... and falling demand keeps pushing up power prices. “The need for reform is now urgent. We can’t keep going as we are,” Wood said. Dr Robert Passey of the solar PV institute agrees that tariff reform is essential and unavoidable, but argues it should be “technology agnostic”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/07/solar-challenge-australia-cars","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-07T03:18:00Z","webTitle":"Solar challenge draws cars built neither for comfort nor for speed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/07/solar-challenge-australia-cars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/07/solar-challenge-australia-cars","fields":{"headline":"Solar challenge draws cars built neither for comfort nor for speed","bodyText":"If you're travelling any part of the 3000km stretch between Darwin and Adelaide in the next few days, don't be alarmed if you see what appears to be alien reconnaissance craft cruising the roads. An array of futuristic vehicles with the sunlight dancing upon their saucer-like tops are taking part in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a marathon north-south trek across the red heart of Australia undertaken by 40 teams. As the name suggests, all of the cars involved in the race must be powered by electricity generated from the sun. Organisers say they welcome \"lateral thinking\" in designs, hence the car that has a coating so aerodynamic that dirt doesn't stick to it, thereby avoiding that perilous moment when you have to guide what looks like a shiny door wedge on wheels through the car wash. \"One of the unique aspects of the event is that we don't prejudge people's ability, we have a class of cars where the only expectation is that you bring your enthusiasm,\" Chris Selwood, the event director, told Guardian Australia. The enthusiasm will be provided by competitors from 23 countries, including a team of native Americans from a tribal reservation in Mississippi, which excelled in a similar race in the US before heading to Australia. \"The on-road component is a big adventure and it's exciting,\" Selwood said. \"But essentially this is a design competition to find the world's most efficient electric car.\" The race component, which lasts for four days, has strict rules. The harsh Australian sun could, theoretically, keep the cars running 24 hours a day so a timeframe of 8am to 5pm is set for driving hours. To ensure that the vehicles run on energy derived from the sun throughout the journey, solar cars are allowed a nominal 5kW of stored energy to run off, around 10% of normal total capacity. They then get as far as they can in the available time, often 600km to 700km, before setting up camp in the outback for the night. \"Early in the morning they'll run off stored energy, mid-morning there will be a balance point of stored energy and energy from the sun and then the middle of the day they will be storing energy as well as using it,\" Selwood said. \"It's a unique position to go down the Stuart highway in these cars. There are 140-tonne road trains but it's a lightly populated road with straight lines of 40km at a time. Australia's the best place to come out and play with solar car.\" Selwood admits the cars aren't built with \"the comfort of the driver in mind\" but adds the \"real heroes\" are the people who devise the energy capture and storage. Long term, this unusual vehicular challenge aims to demonstrate the viability of solar energy as an option for transport. While the popularity of rooftop solar panels has soared among Australian households in recent years, cars, buses and trains are yet to make the switch to solar-powered electricity in large numbers. \"Of course, if you are travelling from Brunswick to the CBD of Melbourne, you probably wouldn't want a huge solar panel on your roof – you'd generally have them on your garage,\" Selwood said. \"If there was the political will, we'd be driving solar cars around our cities now because of the benefits in maintenance. But politicians are too wedded to the status quo. \"At some point, society will have to make the choice between being powered by brown coal or being powered by solar.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/dec/01/carillion-job-cuts-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-01T01:21:07Z","webTitle":"Carillion warns of job cuts due to slashing of solar energy subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/01/carillion-job-cuts-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/dec/01/carillion-job-cuts-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Carillion warns of job cuts due to slashing of solar energy subsidies","bodyText":"Construction company Carillion has warned 4,500 staff their jobs are at risk because of government plans for a dramatic cut in solar energy subsidies. The company has begun a statutory 90-day consultation period in its energy services division prior to the anticipated slashing of feed-in tariffs. The tariffs, known as FITs and paid by energy companies to households and communities who produce electricity via solar panels on their roofs, would be more than halved under government proposals. Ministers are also proposing cutting the subsidies by 12 December instead of April 2012, the date the solar industry is calling for. It is feared the changes could pose problems for Carillion, whose business includes a project to install and manage 30,000 solar panels for local authority and social housing. It is understood that the number of redundancies at the firm, which employs 50,000 staff worldwide, will be well below 4,500, but Carillion said it was too early to speculate on what the final figure would be. The company said in a statement: \"As a result of the government's changes to feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic installations, Carillion Energy Services proposes to accelerate and widen [its restructuring] programme. \"Our solar business was growing strongly, but we expect the government's plans for much larger and earlier than expected cuts to feed-in tariffs to reduce the size of the solar PV market significantly. In order to react to the effects of this on our business, we have launched a statutory 90-day consultation process with our people on how we can reshape our business. \"Until the consultation process is complete it is too early to speculate on how many people will be affected, especially as we will explore all opportunities for redeployment.\" The plans to slash financial incentives for installing solar panels has provoked anger from green groups, with Friends of the Earth planning to mount a legal challenge. The Department of Energy and Climate Change acknowledged the proposed changes would be \"very difficult\" but insisted it wanted an enduring future for the solar industry. \"If we left things as they are, the FIT budget would be eaten up entirely, and that would be even worse for those in this sector and those working on other technologies too,\" a spokesman said. \"We believe solar PV can have a strong and vibrant future in the UK and we are proposing changes to ensure a lasting FITs scheme to support that future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/small-world/2013/aug/19/nanotech-roundup-vitamin-laser-quantum-algae","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-19T06:29:00Z","webTitle":"Nanotech roundup: a cheap oil guzzler, vitamin lasers, and quantum algae | Liesbeth Venema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/small-world/2013/aug/19/nanotech-roundup-vitamin-laser-quantum-algae","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/small-world/2013/aug/19/nanotech-roundup-vitamin-laser-quantum-algae","fields":{"headline":"Nanotech roundup: a cheap oil guzzler, vitamin lasers, and quantum algae","bodyText":"Suck it up Aerogel is a remarkable material. Made entirely from carbon, it is the lightest material on Earth, weighing a seventh as much as air. In addition, it can absorb 900 times its own weight in oil. Highly porous, ultralight solids such as this have many possible applications beyond mopping up oil spills – for example as electrodes in high-power rechargeable batteries, or protection against extreme heat, or for detecting gas pollutants. Researchers at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China have now made a carbon-based foam that may not be as light as aerogel but has other useful properties. For a start, it can be produced cheaply from a foam of polyurethane, a commonplace plastic used as packing material. The group developed a procedure that effectively hollows out the material, resulting in a structure of interconnected tubes each less than a micrometre thick. The foam can absorb up to 100 times its weight in oil, according to a report in Chemistry World. Moreover, in one of the production steps, the material is dipped into a solution containing metals such as iron or copper so that the finished foam is magnetic. This opens up possibilities for remotely steering the foam to where it is needed, for example in laboratory water-oil separation processes, or for cleaning up oil spills. Edible lasers, anyone? Scientists are developing miniature electrical and optical devices that can be safely implanted in the body to monitor vital signs, detect disease at an early stage or assist in delivering the right dose of medicine. Ideally, these devices will be discreet and not require messy extraction – perhaps being absorbed by the body after use. Biocompatible, implantable light-emitting devices already exist, but clinicians would find them even more useful if they emitted laser light. In the 1970s, a few early laser physicists tried to make organic substances like jelly \"lase\". But researchers at Harvard have now made the first fully biocompatible laser. It may not be as tasty as jelly but can be eaten safely, since it's made out of carefully selected non-toxic materials. Going through a list of substances approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the scientists found that vitamin B2 was a good candidate for lasing. To make the laser, a solution of the vitamin was sprayed on to a soft biopolymer film. As the solution evaporated, droplets formed, with the vitamin trapped inside – essentially self-assembled \"optical resonators\" filled with laser dye. In a laser, the optical resonator is where the emitted light bounces back and forth to produce the required amplification. But they are usually bulky mirrors. The authors believe their \"vitamin laser\" could eventually be as useful as biosensors in detecting specific diseases. For Fiorenzo Omenetto, a professor at Tufts University in Massachusetts who studies biophotonics, the vitamin laser is exciting, although practical applications might be some way away. \"The key message is that there may be plenty of less obvious biocompatible optical materials if we look for them – if we get out of our comfort zone,\" he says. A marine quantum experiment Researchers at Vienna University have turned to simple water-dwelling organisms to recreate a classic physics experiment. Physicists have voted the Young's double slit experiment one of the most beautiful science experiments in history, because it elegantly demonstrates one of the most astounding principles in physics: the quantum mechanical effect whereby particles can behave as waves. As waves, the particles can interfere with each other, just like ripples of water in a tank. Young's double slit experiment illustrates this effect for a stream of particles such as electrons. When the particles hit a screen with two openings (the double slit), you would expect the particles to go through either one or the other, creating two distinct peaks in transmission to appear on a screen on the other side. But as a wave, the particles can go through both slits at the same time, and when the slits are about as small as the particles' wavelength an interference pattern emerges on the other side. Remarkably, this also works for things larger than electrons – even for molecules – provided the slits are sufficiently small and the detection method is accurate enough to distinguish interference fringes. While expensive nanofabrication is normally required to make sufficiently small and accurate slits for the experiments, the team in Vienna has now shown that the skeleton of the alga Amphipleura pellucida, which has a regular pore distance of 200 nanometres, works just as well. So the beautiful demonstration that reveals the quantum nature of our world can be carried out with tools collected for free from a beach. Come rain or shine For a solar energy system to break through into widespread use, it will need to supply electricity even when the sun is obscured by cloud and at night. Research in innovative solar energy technologies that can achieve this just got a boost with a $3m (£1.9m) injection from Arpa-E, the US government agency for energy research. The agency wants to stimulate technology options that make better use of incoming sunlight, by producing heat that can be stored and used to generate electricity when the sun isn't shining. A news article in MIT review reports an approach, currently at the development stage, in which a layer of nanoparticles absorbs the longer wavelengths of the solar spectrum to produce heat for storage, while the rest of the available light is converted directly to electricity. Diamond thermometers Scientists have a whole array of microscope techniques at their disposal to look inside cells, but what has been missing is a way to measure temperature changes accurately. Such measurements could greatly advance our understanding of biological mechanisms such as gene expression and cellular metabolism, which are strongly affected by temperature. A group at Harvard has now made a nanothermometer based on tiny diamond crystals that can sense local temperature variations as small as two hundredths of a degree Celsius, thanks to their unique quantum properties. To show how the nanodiamond thermometers could be used in practice, the group injected them into living cells together with gold nanoparticles, which act as local heating elements when excited with laser light. The resulting temperature gradients inside the cell could be mapped from the fluorescence spectra emitted by the nanodiamonds. Besides gaining new insights into cell biology, the nanothermometers could be used to help develop treatments that involve controlled heating, for example to kill malignant tumours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/blog/2014/sep/29/iphone-6-bend-test","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T06:30:00Z","webTitle":"Boot up: iPhone 6 bend results, LED output boost, crypto wars redux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/sep/29/iphone-6-bend-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2014/sep/29/iphone-6-bend-test","fields":{"headline":"Boot up: iPhone 6 bend results, LED output boost, crypto wars redux","bodyText":"A burst of 13 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team I turned my apartment into a smart home… and all I got was bored &gt;&gt; PandoDaily James Robinson: I guess I am better off now in some ways.

Breakthrough in LED construction increases efficiency by 57 percent This latest work was the culmination of previous research by Chou and his team where they first developed the PlaCSH structure to be used on solar cells to more efficiently focus incoming light. This increased the absorption to as high as 96% of the solar energy being received by the photovoltaic cell, which resulted in an increased efficiency of 175%. As such, the team figured that if such a device was so efficient at absorbing light then, logically, it could also be used for light extraction as well. \"From a view point of physics, a good light absorber, which we had for the solar cells, should also be a good light radiator,\" Professor Chou said. \"We wanted to experimentally demonstrate this is true in visible light range, and then use it to solve the key challenges in LEDs and displays. It is so flexible and ductile that it can be weaved into a cloth.\" The team also claims that the PlaCSH organic LEDs are exceptionally cheap to make as they are made using a system called \"nanoimprint,\" a technology Professor Chou invented to make nanostructures in a similar way to a printing press produces newspapers.

But the reality is that the pieces need to work harmoniously, tied together by software. And only after the infrastructure is in place can developers go and create cool new things. Wearables and sensors and connected devices are interesting – but much more so when tied together with killer apps. And platform history tells us that only after infrastructure is laid do developers write software. This was even true for the internet back in the 90's. It wasn't until the web browser and email and other killer apps came along that you really understood the value of the internet, even though it had connected people years earlier. These system wide network effects in mobile, together with new classes of connected devices, are helping close the divide between the digital world and the physical world. It will continue to fall away gradually as we mature technologically. In five years, it's likely that the notion of an app won't exist like it does today. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus bend test &gt;&gt; Consumer Reports News Apple applies 25 kilograms (slightly more than 55 pounds) of force to an iPhone 6 Plus to test flex. What does 55 pounds mean in context? Using our Instron, we found that it's approximately the force required to break three pencils. Consumer Reports' tests pushed the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus much further than 55 pounds. We started light, applying 10 pounds of force for 30 seconds, then releasing the force. Then we increased the force in 10-pound increments, noted when the phones first started to deform (that's what our engineers call it) and stopped the test for each phone when we saw the screen come loose from the case. The results: all the phones we tested showed themselves to be pretty tough. The iPhone 6 Plus, the more robust of the new iPhones in our testing, started to deform when we reached 90 pounds of force, and came apart with 110 pounds of force. With those numbers, it slightly outperformed the HTC One (which is largely regarded as a sturdy, solid phone), as well as the smaller iPhone 6, yet underperformed some other smart phones.

At 150 pounds of force, the Note 3's screen splintered and it stopped working. The iPhone 6 turns out to be weaker under this test than the 6 Plus.

Top Gear Tigers and Bingo Boilers: farewell then, Phones4U &gt;&gt; The Register Andrew Orlowski got hold of - and can finally publish - an internet Phones4U document: As a fond farewell to Phones4U then, this is the way it saw its customers. As far as Phones4U was concerned, the UK was inhabited by such tribes as the iPod Babes, Top Gear Tigers, and Bingo Boilers. Yes, it's a sustained insult by a company to its potential customers - with potentially Ratneresque consequences had it ever got out. But these stereotypes also allowed a 16 year old with no prior retail experience in a phone shop to sell phones successfully - without wasting the punter's time on something that didn't really suit them. And that's successful salesmanship: everyone was happy. The UK has changed, and the phone market has changed enormously in nine years. The prepay/postpay split has reversed. There's much less diversity than before. But I wonder how many of the identifiers are still true? \"I do well for myself &amp; don't mind telling you! (The \"i\" on the back of my car is crucial to me!)\", \"says\" Top Gear Tiger. And maybe he still does. Anyway, without further ado, here are the people of Britain as seen through the 2005 lens of the Phones4U marketing department Which one are you? Old technopanic in new iBottles &gt;&gt; Cato @ Liberty Julian Sanchez: Gather around young'uns: Back in the antediluvean early 90s, when the digital world was young, a motley group of technologists and privacy advocates fought what are now, somewhat melodramatically, known as the Crypto Wars. There were many distinct battlefields, but the overarching question over which the Crypto Wars were fought was this: Would ordinary citizens be free to protect their communications and private files using strong, truly secure cryptography, or would governments seek to force programmers and computer makers to build in backdoors that would enable any scheme of encryption to be broken by the authorities? Sanchez's (long) post is an excellent response to all the concerns about smartphones having better default security than PCs. Why don't PCs have default security as good as smartphones? How Apple's business model burned Samsung &gt;&gt; Tech.pinions Tim Bajarin (who is the older Bajarin - consulted with Diamond Multimedia about MP3 players and Microsoft about tablets in 1991): To say there was pent up demand for an iPhone with larger screens would be an understatement. One of the things I found out when talking to people waiting in lines for the new iPhones at Apple Stores is many of those who bought the Samsung Note 3 did so because it was the only one out there with this size screen. But now that Apple had one with basically the same size screen, they were going to switch to Apple. I also talked with someone familiar with Samsung's own research on what prompted people to buy a Note 3, thinking it might be the pen or the larger screen. Interestingly, what they found is that many people, especially in Asia, believe bigger is better and that the Galaxy Note in their mind was a premium product. Now that Apple has one of their own, it too will be viewed as a premium product in all of these markets and there is no doubt Apple is going to capitalize on this fact in a big way. Apple's entering the phablet space with a premium competitor is going to have a major impact on Samsung's fortunes. \"Talking to people and finding out their motivitions\" is such a foreign concept to many.

December 2013: one-in-four smartphone owners don't use a case &gt;&gt; npd.com December 2013: While a large portion of smartphone owners do use a case to protect their smartphone, one-in-four go case-less, according to The NPD Group's recent Smartphone Case Segmentation Study. Among this group, almost 70% own an Android phone while just 20% are using an iPhone. One-in-three Android owners who don't have a case said it's because they weren't worried about dropping their phone. A third of iPhone owners who do not use a case say a case would add too much bulk to the design of their phone. 22% of iPhone owners then were unworried about dropping their phone (v 32% Android owners). In all, 87% of iPhone owners used a case; for Android the figure was 66%. Crisis in China: Samsung fell to #4 smartphone maker in China in August &gt;&gt; BusinessKorea Chinese smartphone vendors are increasing their global market share at an alarming rate. According to sources in the financial investment industry on 24 September, four Chinese companies – Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi Tech, and ZTE – made up 25% of the global smartphone market in August, a 12% year-on-year gain, which is the highest-ever result. In particular, the upward trend of Lenovo's market share was noticeable. The Chinese Android phone manufacturer has maintained the third spot by steadily increasing its share with 7.5% in June, 8.0% in July, and 9.2% in August. On the other hand, the position of Samsung Electronics and Apple, the two prominent smartphone makers, weakened owing to Chinese firms' good performances. Last month, Samsung and Apple comprised only 33.7% of the market with Samsung at 22.3% and Apple at 11.4%. The combined market share of the two companies was 39.9% in June, hovering below 40% for the first time in 21 months. Since then, the number has further decreased, with 35.1% in July and 33.7% in August. \"Alarming\"? Samsung: learning from the PC era &gt;&gt; Tech-Thoughts Sameer Singh harks back to the 1980s and 1990s: when \"good enough\" PC clones entered the market, IBM's products were the first to be caught in their upmarket march. On the other hand, Microsoft and Intel, suppliers of the two most valuable components of the PC, saw a sharp uptick in their revenues and profits as downstream competition intensified. But, thanks to Lou Gerstner, IBM also found a way to recover from this decline. First, IBM refocused on their core competence to stabilize their business (selling mainframes to enterprises). Second, and more importantly, IBM de-emphasized highly competitive, commodity businesses and pivoted their business model to focus on layers of the value chain that were not over-served. Thanks to intense price competition and \"good enough\" products, PC penetration was skyrocketing among businesses. This created an opportunity to profit from new demand for enterprise services and systems integration. The first half of this IBM's story clearly describes Samsung's predicament today. But, he suggests, the second half suggests Samsung's path to future success.

Two weeks ago I was at the nation's biggest exhibition dedicated to municipal waste. The hall was full of big kit and startling innovation, the sort of thing that makes the Great Exhibition look a bit lacklustre. I was surrounded by leviathan machinery for crushing, sorting or burning our discards, all attempting to entice local authorities and waste companies to buy in. But to which, recycling or incineration? The industry seemed split down the middle. It is annoying that the UK has a patchwork of systems – some refuse is commingled (ie thrown together in a box), some separated. The Campaign for Real Recycling (realrecycling.org.uk) says that separated streams are better – the recyclate is less likely to be contaminated, therefore offering material that can be sold worldwide. Your best bet is to follow that \"Reduce, reuse and recycle\" mantra (the one the Wombles taught us). And recycle as much as possible, very precisely. It's easy – the boxes are well labelled and it only takes minutes. Superficially our 2012 rubbish figures look good. Recycling surpassed our pastime of shovelling stinking rubbish into landfill – an unappealing aspect of our mining heritage – so that 43% was recycled, 34% landfilled and 21% incinerated. Achieving this required herculean effort on behalf of just about everyone, plus an escalator tax system which makes it uneconomic to landfill. Well done, everyone! Except that this is not quite good enough. Our rate of improvement dropped last year, leading to fears it could flatline. Meanwhile England's 23 incinerators (70 others are rumoured to be in the pipeline) are waiting to capitalise on any recycling apathy. And while we've become obsessed about the evils of landfills, the atmospheric equivalent, skyfill, gets little air time. I won't go into the much-disputed health impacts of incineration here. New-age incinerators have been billed as cleaner and greener, able to turn trash into energy and rebranded \"energy from waste facilities\" or \"energy recovery units\". But incineration could impede recycling, diverting rubbish to keep these expensive operations functioning. Recycling's best defence is to keep up the noise about recycling, to assert that after reduce or reuse this remains the smart, green way to go. Or we could devolve this task once again to the Wombles – they've been signed up for a new 26-part series.

The impact of harnessing the sun's energy to help power the school, however, reaches far beyond financial benefits. As schools up and down the country have discovered, becoming solar champions has kick started a wave of other eco-initiatives, informed subjects across the curriculum and empowered pupils to take responsibility for determining the kind of world they want to live in when they grow up. The Guardian Teacher Network spoke to three schools where solar energy has had a transformative effect. EP Collier Primary School in Reading Teaching assistant Charlotte Syme has helped to champion green issues and says the solar panels, which were fitted last year with the help of the Solar Schools project, have regenerated pupil enthusiasm: We now have an eco-committee with two representatives from each class. They have done campaigns, such as turning the lights off, conserving energy and making sure teachers turn their laptops off when they are at lunch. All those kinds of things have helped not only in the actual conservation of energy in the classroom, but also in their general awareness. Then they take it home, nag their parents about it and they generally are becoming a greener community. It's been a brilliant success. We have also saved more than a tonne of carbon. We keep track using a panel which we had fitted in the corridor so every time the children walk past, they can see all the numbers. The children update you all the time. We had an assembly which explained what all the figures mean so they can access it and understand it. They not only have much more of an awareness of their impact on the environment but they also care more. It's like a challenge to them. There has become a real buzz about the place and how they can achieve that and make it even better. It's kick started everything. Energy and the lights are the big thing which they can easily access, but they have also helped campaign to conserve paper towels. You're only allowed one paper towel at a time now. They have become aware of the whole issue of sustainability, moving forward and what their planet will be like if they don't look after it. Last year when we had the panels fitted they did a monitoring of the energy used in the school. The school bursar printed out charts of our energy consumption within a three month period and they analysed the comparison. They were so excited when at the end of the three months they had made the graph go down a little bit because they had used less energy than the month before. There were a lot of discussions in December because we had Christmas tree lights everywhere and it went back up again. It was good because we were able to show them consequences of using different electrical appliances and the need for it to be sustained. Newnham Croft Primary in Cambridge Teacher Jo Turner says that since solar panels were installed by the Solar Schools project in February 2012, they have given the school a major boost in all aspects of their eco-work in lessons: Sustainability is part of all classes and covered through every topic. Some classes have even used the solar panels to inform maths lessons. They have exported data into Excel spreadsheets and constructed various charts and graphs, including how much energy is generated compared with consumption and generation per month and over the course of a day. We also have a pupil eco-group which discusses energy usage within school and the data is looked at frequently by group members. All children are aware of the power we are generating and consuming through a screen that permanently displays our data in the corridor. Whole school assemblies also communicate information about the solar panels. Recently key stage 2 had an 'energy matters' workshop, looking at how energy is made in various ways. Year 3 and 4 children had solar panel kits which they took outside to see where best to position to collect the most light. Incorporating the schools' solar panels into lessons is an ongoing process and something we are keen to do more. Most importantly, having solar panels on school property sends a really important message to the children about the importance of moving towards sustainable energy and reducing our carbon footprint. As teachers, we need to educate children on the impact that we have on our environment and model making positive changes that help the planet. By having solar panels we are making a statement about how we feel about the environment. Icknield School in Andover, Hampshire, is a special school for children and young people aged from three to 19 with severe learning difficulties Deputy head Ruth Drewett has not only helped her school win Keep Britain Tidy's silver award for eco schools, but says embracing solar power has improved the quality of life for many of the school's less-able pupils: In terms of resources, the money we save using solar energy releases funds to buy specialist equipment for some of our less-able children. We also have an eco-council which has a member from each class. It was set up by teachers initially to come up with ideas for improving the environment of the school. It was quite easy to have solar panels installed and the difference has meant that instead of spending £10,000 on electricity we are able to fund specialist tracking equipment, for example, so children can be independent in terms of moving their wheelchairs around the school. Being green is not only benefiting the environment but the quality of life of our pupils. It's very much part of our school values. We are a rights-respecting school and our children have a right to a clean environment. They also have the responsibility for looking after their environment: solar panels support that ethos.

Yet former oil executive Gary Kendall credits the British coal-mining town with setting in motion a global energy system that could jeopardise our very existence. In 1712 Thomas Newcomen introduced his revolutionary steam engine. The breakthrough machine burned coal, to create steam, to spurt out subterranean water, to dig deeper in Dudley's pits. Deeper mines meant greater coal production, which warmed more homes and powered more factories. Kendall says Newcomen's invention kicked off an \"exponential spiral in energy consumption\" that now leaves the planet's atmosphere facing potentially catastrophic levels of carbon dioxide. He speaks as an insider, spending just shy of a decade working in downstream operations for US oil major, Exxon. His final posting took him to Beijing. \"That's where I realised that these sums don't work,\" he says, in reference to the world's most populous nation and the prospect of its surging use of fossil fuels. Newcomen's curse So why blame Newcomen? Two reasons, according to Kendall, who is now deputy director of the University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainable Leadership in South Africa. First, there's the idea of \"begetting energy with energy\". Fortunately, the extra coal the steam engine helped produce outweighed the coal it consumed. Big Oil plays to exactly the same equation today, Kendall observes: \"The amount of energy that is necessary to get oil out of the ground is extraordinary, but we're still managing to get more oil out than we put in.\" The classic market response: keep digging. Reason two is arguably more profound. In essence, Newcomen enabled mankind to \"cheat\" the natural energy system. Pre-1712, people got by with two basic energy types: the wheel and fire. Both relied directly or indirectly on sunlight. Things used to be moved by human or animal muscle (which requires energy, hence food, hence sunlight), or by wind (which requires thermal currents, hence sunlight), or by falling water (which requires condensation and evaporation, hence sunlight). Man has been burning wood, peat and other biomass for millennia. Ultimately this is bound by sunlight too, as energy was required to source these fuels and transport them. The unique attribute of Newcomen's engine centres on its creation of motion from fire. The previous limitations of sunlight were broken. \"If you're burning peat, and wood and coal, then you're burning old sunlight\", Kendall argues. In the case of oil, it's sunlight that dates back to the carboniferous period, long before human beings. Kendall concedes that much of human progress and development is owing to the mobility that fossil fuels have made possible. But messing with nature in this way is not without its costs. \"When this solar energy was laid down in coal and oil and gas deposits, the biosphere of the earth was completely different… So when we now release the carbon into the atmosphere... we're reversing the clock and returning the Earth's atmosphere to a state that existed before human beings arrived here.\" Addiction to oil The wisdom of such experimentation – what Kendall refers to as mankind playing \"mouse and crazy scientist simultaneously\" – seems doubtful. So why do we do it? And why don't we stop? Detangling a world economy and transport system structured around fossil fuels is \"fiendishly complicated\". We all presume cheap, easy fuel. Even if we could find a clean alternative tomorrow, would we? Kendall is doubtful. The downsides aren't immediate nor are they directly personal. In most cases, other people have to deal with them and at some other time. Then there are the \"eye-watering\" vested interests. Of the largest 10 companies by revenue in the Fortune 500, all bar one is an oil company or automaker, he points out: \"I can't imagine any other industry on Earth that holds such sway politically and economically.\" With business models built around burning fossil fuels, it makes perfect sense they should try and keep the status quo. As the former Exxon executive puts it: \"This isn't a conspiracy theory. This is just basic logic.\" The world's biggest oil companies aren't daft. They know the writing is on the wall for crude – for reasons of geopolitics (oil production is increasingly controlled by nation states) and geology (it's harder to find), quite apart from the fast-depleting ozone layer. Hence their move into biofuels, gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids, and – as is now becoming increasingly in vogue in the US – compressed gas. All these \"concessions\" still fundamentally presume the conversion of hydrocarbons into liquid transport fuels. Alternative routes Electrification via renewable energy forms is clearly the way to go in sustainability terms. It's impossible to convert solar energy and its clean derivatives into liquid fuels. Better convert them to electricity. The problem then is storage. In terms of energy density, electric batteries are simply no match for crude oil. Not now, not ever. Re-jigging our energy matrix will involve a fair dose of short-term pain. The idea that we can simply swap combustion engines for electric motors, and then carry on much as before, is \"absurd\", Kendall says. Mobility-wise, we must accept that the means at our disposal are more limited. Video conferencing and other internet-based communications can make up for some of the opportunities we'll inevitably lose as a consequence. But not all. A useful principle going forward is the idea of maximum load factors, says Kendall. At present, we drive around in cars weighing a tonne or more. Given that the average human weighs about 70-80 kilos, \"only a tiny fraction\" of the energy we put into running a vehicle goes towards carrying us forwards. Compare that to a full bus or, even better, an electric bicycle. Then there's the sub-optimal usage of most passenger cars to consider. \"You don't get a quarter of a person riding a bicycle\", he notes, comparing it to a four-person car with one driver. Oh, and the clock is ticking. Kendall gives the world about four decades to wean itself off its addiction to fossil fuels before the environmental consequences simply become too great. Radical transformation awaits the world regardless. The only question is whether we choose that transformation \"willingly and with a smile on our face\", or whether it's chosen for us \"unhappily and with tears\".

He does not buy into the idea that the government wants to stop solar farms spreading in the countryside. “Firstly it is important to understand that the proposed changes announced today are nothing whatsoever about the Government wanting to prevent solar farm deployment, as they are well aware that solar remains the most popular of all energy technologies. We are at the cusp of a solar revolution that will deliver much needed energy security to Britain and government recognise that the large scale application of solar is currently the most efficient and cost effective form of electricity generation that we have. \"Following a meeting with the Secretary of State Ed Davey today, we are considering our position as clearly the challenge for us and the entire solar industry in the UK is within the detail of the CFD regime itself; which solar is now being forced into and more specifically, how this system is going to be implemented for solar; which clearly has different considerations to other technologies.” Our question today was probably misguided. The UK has undertaken to meet certain renewable targets by 2020, so no matter what Decc does with the solar industry (within reason) the amount of renewables will continue to increase to this level. What is more interesting is whether these proposals will save money, as Decc is claiming. On the surface it seems unworkable to drive investment from an industry that has reduced its costs by up to 30% in the past two years. Especially when the Tories also plan to curb onshore wind - currently the cheapest form of renewable electricity. But the government argues that the budget for subsidies, called the Levy Control Framework (LCF), was in danger of being eaten up by the booming solar industry. This would mean two things: nothing for other technologies and potentially a breach of the budget, with extra costs passed on to bills. How close the LCF was to being exceeded, Decc was unable to say today. It is very difficult to know which of these scenarios is likely to have occurred had the status quo continued. The RO contribution to solar had already been scaled back twice to match the falling costs of the industry and was on a sliding scale designed to reduce it further to 2017. But such has been the success of the industry, that it has continued to burn brighter than departmental predictions. This is little comfort to the large-scale solar industry who will wonder why they are being punished for Decc's underestimations. They feel the adjustment has been mishandled and will undermine investor confidence, not only in solar, but all renewables. Yet claims that solar farms will die under this policy may be overstated. Solar will compete for contracts for difference against onshore wind, waste energy and biomass conversion. All currently cheaper energy forms. But with the price of solar dropping fast, it may be that the technology will hit a speed bump rather than a wall. It's really worthwhile reading James Murray's blog on Business Green. He says the industry was in danger of blowing the Levy Control Framework (LCF). This would raise bills for consumers. \"The drastic reduction in the cost of solar technologies - by some industry estimates solar farm costs have fallen over 30 per cent in two years - coupled with the breakneck speed with which solar panels can be installed presents a unique challenge to policymakers. A challenge Whitehall is still yet to get to grips with. \"Ministers have a responsibility to retain a high degree of budget control, not least because the LCF is not a bottomless pit of money, it is paid for through the energy bills of households and businesses and as such excessive deployment of subsidised projects could and would lead to higher bills for the public.\" The Tory agenda on solar farms is fairly clear. Like onshore wind, they see them as scar on the landscape. Here are some past statements from ministers. In December, Michael Fallon said: “It is not right – it is immoral – for hard working, base rate tax payers to be lining the pockets of landowners by funding the development of large scale renewables that do not need further subsidy”. In November, planning minister Eric Pickles ruled proposals for a solar farm in Ellough in Suffolk would cause “unacceptable” harm to the surrounding area. Also in December, Greg Barker foreshadowed today's announcement, saying: \"I'm not a fan of large-scale solar farms. That's not to say there are no cases where we can't have a large-scale solar farm, on disused airports or where they are shielded from public view. But the industry has to get very real and realise that there is a real danger that inappropriately sited monster solar farms could end up turning the tide of public opinion against solar, which would be an absolute disaster\". Robert Goss, managing director of Conergy UK, who participated on DECC's solar strategy taskforce, says this is not the disaster many in the solar industry think. “Let’s wait on the results of the consultation but DECC’s proposals are more of a gradual recalibration than an earthquake for British solar. Rather than disappearing overnight, we would just select sites in a different way. Many large projects would still be built under the CFDs, and ROCs would remain in force in Northern Ireland, where development would become very competitive. In other parts of the UK there would be a downsizing of the scale of many new solar farms, which is politically attractive, but offers encouragement for sites that have been neglected over the last few months.” He is echoed by one of our readers. Decc's justification for the proposals today does not seem to bear up under investigation. The department argues that because the solar industry has expanded much faster than expected, it is drawing more funding than Decc budgeted for. Okay so far. But the policy proposal then says: \"If spend in one area of the Levy Control Framework (LCF) increases unsustainably, it will increase pressure on bills unless it is matched by cost reductions elsewhere.\" Here they are again on Twitter, saying that the policy is about delivering value for money. This seems disingenuous. Both statements imply that consumers are making a saving by capping solar energy. But according to the Renewable Energy Association (REA), solar farms are en route to become the cheapest renewable technology by 2018 (barring the limited-capacity energy from waste industry). Surely this means any policy which discourages investment in solar farms will make meeting the 2020 renewable targets more expensive? Especially considering onshore wind, currently the cheapest renewable technology, may also be curbed if the Tories win the next election. I am waiting for a Decc reply on this. The Telegraph's triumphant headline on this story reads: \"End to solar farm blight as subsidy scheme is scrapped\". Leaving aside the insight into the politics of this policy for a moment, the inference on the future of solar farms is incorrect. Next year these projects will need to compete for contracts for difference (CfDs). But as yet, Decc has not finalised how the auctions for these will work. There has been an indication that solar will be treated as a 'mature technology'. This means it will compete against the cheapest renewable energy source, onshore wind. This is why the solar industry are rattled. They argue that this threat and uncertainty may tacitly kill the industry by driving investors away from large-scale projects. But it is too early to toss solar farms on the death cart just yet. They are still rapidly expanding and steadily cheaper generators. In fact, Solar Power Portal think this policy will produce a rush during the next 11 months as projects expand their capacity before they lose the RO. \"Despite the threat of RO support being removed completely in April 2015, the large-scale solar sector in UK is predicted to become Europe’s largest in 2014, with some analysts predicting that the planned ROC closure for &gt;5MW could trigger as much as 4GW of solar farms to be installed from now until April 2015.\" Renewables investors are less strident than those in the solar industry about today's changes. Rebecca O'Connor, director of Trillion Fund said: \"Removing subsidies, as the Government is planning by closing the Renewable Obligation for projects over 5MW from next April, is never going to be painless and it will be scary times for those developers facing lower returns than they have calculated. \"But we have been saying for some time that solar, which is plummeting in cost, looks set to compete on its own two feet with fossil fuels. It looks like we will find out if this is the case sooner rather than later. The important thing is that the transition away from subsidies is done fairly.\" Karl Harder, co-founder of Abundance Generation said: \"Solar power is not only a new, clean energy source supported by 85% of the UK public, but it's one that's being invested in too. The key to diversifying our energy supply, keeping prices down and cutting emissions is ensuring stability for this growing industry - not stop start policy changes. Ultimately investment will continue, and flow into on roof solar, such is the demand we're seeing, but really - what kind of Government would stop the most democratic, clean energy source from thriving? We must separate decisions on energy from political whims once and for all. If politicians cannot be trusted to not put winning short term votes ahead of sensible energy policy then we should vote to take such decisions away from them. Similar to Gordon Browns transfer of interest rates policy to the Bank of England, renewable energy tariff decisions should be dealt with by a non-political body. The British public has moved on, they're looking for win win investments and old school Government thinking is being left behind.\" I have heard similar things from others on the subject of shifting the emphasis towards rooftop solar. Ben Lewis, from property agents GVA, says there is serious concern from investors. Where the owner of a building wants to install solar on their roof, there will be no complication. But when a tenant is involved there can be all sorts of complications. Lewis says this could seriously hamper the shift from ground to roof mounted arrays. Large scale solar PV is deploying much faster than previously expected. While this is good news, we are concerned about the impact this speed of deployment under the RO could have on the Levy Control Framework (LCF) which sets annual limits on the overall cost of DECC’s levy-funded policies. If spend in one area of the LCF increases unsustainably, it will increase pressure on bills unless it is matched by cost reductions elsewhere. We propose to achieve this by closing the RO across Great Britain12 to new solar PV generating stations, both ground- and building-mounted, above 5MW from 1 April 2015. We therefore propose to split the current FIT degression band for over 50kW and stand-alone installations into two separate bands to assist in realising the Government’s ambition to increase deployment of building-mounted solar PV. In other words: The industry has been more successful than expected. This is partly a result of its ability to reduce the cost of its electricity. There are now more than 250 solar farms in the UK. The government is concerned about the impact this is having on the budget that controls Decc subsidies. In order to reduce this, Decc will stop issuing renewable obligation certificates to large-scale solar projects after March next year. But it will make some efforts to encourage investment in rooftop solar by making changes to the feed-in-tariff for smaller projects. Greenpeace UK chief scientist Doug Parr said: “Solar is hugely popular in the UK, costs are falling faster than for any other energy source, and the latest technology is on track to beat nuclear on price. Sowing uncertainty for a key source of clean, homegrown energy, as ministers are doing, makes no economic, political, or strategic sense. “Far from hitting the big energy companies this compulsive policy tinkering sucks confidence out of independent generation and leaves the future of community solar projects up in the air – yet independent producers are our best hope to challenge the big six’s stranglehold on the market.\" Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton, said: “Government should be doing all that it can to support solar power at all scales – not making it more difficult... Ministers’ claims that solar farms are blighting our countryside are wildly overstated. Such installations typically take up less than 5% of the land they are on, leaving huge scope to develop protected habitats to support local wildlife and plant life.” Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Alasdair Cameron questioned whether the support for rooftop solar would be effective. “This review shows that the Government’s renewables strategy is in some disarray and struggling to catch up with developments. “Every time a renewable energy technology starts to do well it gets hit by a wave of Government uncertainty, which pushes up costs and threatens jobs and investment. “Attacking large-scale solar parks, while doing almost nothing to boost rooftop systems, is another sign of this Government’s piecemeal approach to policy making. Solar power is cheap, popular and essential for tackling climate change and energy security.\" Seb Berry, Solarcentury’s head of public affairs said \" the outlook [for the industry] beyond the end of this financial year is extremely uncertain\". \"Today's announcement is unnecessary and totally at odds with the government's desire to reduce the cost to energy bill payers of delivering the 2020 renewable energy target. Following close behind recent unhelpful media coverage of onshore wind policy, this policy proposal will undermine investor confidence in the entire UK renewable energy sector, by removing at a stroke the short and medium-term policy certainty required for major project investments. It is very surprising that such a deeply damaging policy proposal has been cleared by the Treasury. “It is equally surprising that the government is trying justify this proposal on cost grounds. Large-scale solar is already significantly cheaper than offshore wind and will be competitive with onshore wind by 2017. In deliberately setting out to strangle the growth of cheaper solar from 2015, Secretary of State Davey can no longer claim that government policy will deliver the most cost-effective mix of technologies by 2020.\" Juliet Davenport, founder of Good Energy, said: \"This will undermine growth, investment and jobs in a sector which is helping to introduce more competition and new players into the energy market. \"This decision will bring further instability and uncertainty to investors, and we will have to reconsider our portfolio of investments as a result.” Renewable Energy Association chief executive Nina Skorupska said: “Clear, stable policy attracts investment, creates jobs and drives growth and cost reductions in renewable energy technologies. However, there is not much clarity or stability on show today. The piecemeal approach to the CfD scheme leaves a lot of questions still unanswered... Without knowing what DECC intends to do in terms of setting out the budget, making sense of CfD proposals is like trying to complete a jigsaw puzzle without seeing the picture on the lid. “Solar power meanwhile is subjected yet again to devastating instability. Government must ensure that policy drives and rewards technology cost reductions with a stable trajectory of gradually declining financial support, not the cliff edge the Government is proposing for solar.” The changes to the solar energy subsidies will shift large scale solar projects out of the Renewables Obligation scheme. Instead they will compete for government Contracts for Difference. Here's a quick guide to these terms. The Renewables Obligation (RO) The RO is a subsidy mechanism designed to support the development of clean energy projects in the UK. Introduced in 2002, the RO forces energy suppliers to source an increasing amount of their electricity from renewables. How it works: Generators of renewable energy are granted a Renewable Energy Certficate (ROC) which corresponds to a certain level of energy production. Currently, rooftop solar attracts 1.7 ROC/MWh. Solar farms get slightly less, 1.6 ROC/MWh. These generators can sell their ROCs to energy companies, allowing them to attract a premium for their electricity. Energy companies use ROCs to meet certain quotas. If they fail to meet these targets, they are penalised. The money goes into a fund which administers the scheme. The left over cash is paid to the clean energy operators. Electricity Market Reform (EMR) The EMR is a policy introduced by the coalition government. It changes the way in which renewable and nuclear energy generation is supported in the UK. It introduces Contracts for Difference (CfDs) which set the price of electricity that energy companies buy from the generators. This insulates them from market fluctuations, providing investors in new projects with certainty. In April the government heralded a \"green energy boom\" after it issued its first eight CfDs for renewable projects. Why are they changing? Green Age says: The Renewable Obligation system was introduced in 2002, when the wholesale price of renewable resources was comparably more expensive than fossil fuels. Throughout the last decade and continuing on this decade oil and gas prices have been going up, while the technology for renewable sources has improved and the output price has fallen. Therefore as part of the EMR, the government had to consider another mechanism that wouldn’t provide the generators with a ‘super-normal’ windfall going forward, as it is possible under the current framework. Big solar farms will no longer receive government subsidies under proposals released today. Instead, the government will expand support for rooftop solar and community-owned solar projects. Fiona Harvey reports for the Guardian: Installations of photovoltaic equipment amounting to 5MW and above will no longer receive payments under the renewables obligation, as they currently do, under the proposals, expected to take effect from next April. After that, solar farms would receive support under the “contracts for difference” scheme, which was brought in under the electricity market reforms for large-scale low-carbon power. This would mean they would have to compete for cash with other forms of renewable energy, such as onshore wind and energy from waste, which the government classes as “established”. In an echo of recent Tory policy announcements on onshore wind, rooftop solar installations will receive higher feed-in-tariffs in order to discourage solar installations in rural areas, which are seen as politically unpopular. The industry have been warning that these changes could push solar in the UK \"over a cliff\". But Decc says faster than expected growth of solar in the UK has put pressure on the budget allocated to support it and this will bring the industry on to a level footing with other renewable energy technologies. The entire renewable energy field will be affected by this news. But will it generate further investment and competition in the sector? Or will it simply drown the solar industry.

So goes the cost-cutting corporate human resources mantra. Even on an uninhabited coral island in the middle of nowhere? To the dismay, perhaps, of office workers everywhere, Frenchman Gauthier Toulemonde has returned to civilisation to report that it is indeed possible, though not necessarily desirable nor particularly cheap, to relocate staff \"offshore\". Until six weeks ago, Toulemonde, a businessman, journalist and former banker, was inclined to agree with the received wisdom that workers, given the right equipment, can labour more or less anywhere. Being adventurous as well as entrepreneurial, however, he decided to put the theory to the test and at the same time fulfil a childhood dream of living like a modern-day Robinson Crusoe. \"Who hasn't dreamed of going to a desert island, to get away from it all, to go on an adventure. For me it was a childhood dream. When I'm big I'll leave, I told myself, but as an adult obliged to work to live and subject to the numerous constraints of modern life, I realised it was complicated,\" he wrote in his blog. But a year ago, fed up with commuting from his home in the northern French city of Lille to Paris, Toulemonde, 54, decided to relocate his job as the head of a publishing business to an uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere for several weeks. \"I found myself in Gare Saint Lazare in Paris just before Christmas watching the continuous stream of people passing by,\" he told the Guardian. \"They had this sad look on their faces, even though they were carrying Christmas presents. It had long seemed to me absurd this travelling back and forth to offices. \"My idea of going away had been growing for a while, but it was on that day, I decided to leave.\" It took six months to identify a suitable island, a 700-by-500-metre island in the Indonesian archipelago (the Indonesians made him promise not to reveal its exact location) 10,000 miles from Paris, and a few more months to prepare. On 8 October, he left his home in Lille with four towel-sized solar panels, a windmill, a laptop computer, a tablet computer and two satellite phones. He was also carrying two tents to protect him, and the equipment from the humidity and the seasonal heavy rains. Gecko, a borrowed dog, \"rented\" from a Chinese businessman came too to scare off local wildlife that included rats and snakes. Toulemonde, who had a budget of €10,000 (£8,300) for the adventure, including €20 a day for internet, said he wanted to be the world's first \"Web Robinson\". \"I wanted to show how with solar energy and new technology, we can live differently and work from far away cutting out all the time lost in commuting,\" he said. \"The Anglo-Saxon world is far more open to this idea of distance working, but there is a resistance to it in France.\" He added, that the adventure was no holiday: \"I had a business to run, and had to deal with suppliers, banks, clients. The aim was to show I could do this on my own from far away.\" He woke at 5am daily and went to bed around midnight. For a change of diet from the rice and pasta he had packed, Toulemonde fished in the sea and rooted out vegetables. In between, his company Timbopresse was able to publish two editions of Stamps Magazine, to the same deadlines and with the same content. This week, on his return from the long distance 40-day \"business trip\", Toulemonde, was a changed man. There were, he admitted, the good points. \"It was like being in quarantine for 40 days,\" he said. \"It was good to get away from modern life, to follow the rhythm of the sun and to live in the closest possible contact with nature. \"There's always the risk that when you actually fulfil a childhood dream it won't live up to what you expect. In this case far from it. I was extremely happy. Every day was magical.\" And there were also the, well, not so good. Quite apart from the rats and snakes and the torrential rain and \"terrifying storm\" on his first night on the island, there was the constant and terrifying fear of the internet being cut off for lack of electricity or because the rats had got to the cables. And, he was forced to admit, life can get a bit dull without someone to say \"bonjour\" to every morning. \"Doing everything virtually has its limits,\" he admitted on Friday. \"Working from a distance is certainly doable, and with the internet and Skype you are never alone. But I'd say 40 days is about the limit. \"But it's not the same as physically meeting someone. Nothing can replace human contact.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/23/carbon-limit-electricity-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-23T10:29:50Z","webTitle":"We must impose a carbon limit on new electricity generation here and now | Keith Barnham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/carbon-limit-electricity-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/23/carbon-limit-electricity-generation","fields":{"headline":"We must impose a carbon limit on new electricity generation here and now","bodyText":"Arctic ice is melting faster than expected. Five years ago authoritative predictions suggested it would take until 2065 to shrink to the size it reached last month. Drastic action is necessary to reduce emissions from the energy sector if we are to slow the rate of global warming. Earlier this year, the UK government's independent climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), called for the carbon footprint of UK electricity to be 50g/kWh by 2030. However, the government has set a standard for new electricity generators that is nine times higher. This is to allow electricity generation from natural gas. But we will not achieve the CCC target if these gas plants are built, because they typically last 30 years. The government claims this \"dash for gas\" will lead us out of recession. Rather than listening to the fossil fuel lobby, the government should look to Germany, now leading Europe out of recession. In today's Nature Materials, I point out, with German and Italian colleagues, that the peak price of electricity in Germany is falling steadily, giving their industry a competitive advantage. The peak price is falling because the amount of solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity is rising exponentially. In summer or winter, PV systems in Germany supply cheap electricity with maximum power around noon, when the sun is highest. The peak demand, and therefore peak price of electricity, also occurs around noon. In the UK, an all-renewable electricity supply would be even easier than Germany because the monthly wind variation and evening electricity demand match. Our evidence suggests the most effective, cheapest and quickest way to achieve the CCC target is to impose their limit on new electricity generation here and now. All the renewable energy technologies are well below the CCC limit. Most of them are already well established. In 2011 the UK had 12.3GW of renewable power which is around 20% of our maximum electricity demand. Many more renewable energy technologies are available now than in 2006. Offshore wind is expanding. My group at Imperial has developed solar cells that are being manufactured with three times the efficiency of current PV panels. Tidal and wave power did not appear in the 2011 figures, yet the UK has one half and one third respectively of Europe's tidal and wave resources. Bioenergy contributes around one quarter of the UK renewable supply. Many types of biogas generator produce electricity cheaper than using natural gas. A fast-rising biogas contributor is anaerobic digestion. This is biogas from bacterial fermentation of food, sewage or livestock waste in closed vessels. Resulting carbon dioxide emissions are much lower than the CCC limit and greenhouse gases from the rotting waste are avoided. Importantly, all biogas fuels are indigenous. A \"dash for biogas\" will mean the price of UK electricity will no longer depend on the whim of foreign governments. There would also be no need for the environmentally unsound and politically unpopular method of \"fracking\" for shale gas. Recovery from recession is hindered by the reluctance of banks to invest in new industry. A large number of first-time investors were prepared to support the UK renewable industry but were deterred when the feed-in tariff (FiT) for solar photovoltaics was cut in half. The FiT should be more closely modelled on the successful German counterpart. If the Treasury reversed its decision to count the FiT on its books, public expenditure would be reduced at a stroke. An even bigger boost to government finances could result if the CCC limit were imposed now. The government could save much of the £3bn tax break they gave the fossil fuel industry in the budget. Adopting the CCC limit now would help the UK emerge from recession. The cost of electricity would fall, new jobs would be created, government debt would fall and, at last, the government could fulfil its pledge to be \"the greenest government ever.\" • Keith Barnham is emeritus professor of physics at Imperial College London and author of The Burning Answer to be published by Orion Books next year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/terra-india/2013/apr/23/india-solar-plans-us-trade-spat","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-23T11:10:28Z","webTitle":"India's grand solar plans threatened by ugly US trade spat | Kavitha Rao","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/terra-india/2013/apr/23/india-solar-plans-us-trade-spat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/terra-india/2013/apr/23/india-solar-plans-us-trade-spat","fields":{"headline":"India's grand solar plans threatened by ugly US trade spat","bodyText":"Should trade wars and protecting local jobs get in the way of clean energy? That's the dilemma before India – and the world – at the moment. Desperately short of power, but with an average of 300 sunny days a year, India is aggressively pursuing solar energy. Its national solar programme, the grandly named Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (named after India's first prime minister) plans to generate 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022. But an ugly trade spat with the US may frustrate India's efforts to go solar. In February this year, the US asked the World Trade Organisation for dispute consultations concerning the \"domestic content\" requirement of the solar programme. Domestic content is a loaded phrase in international trade. What it means is that India requires solar energy producers to use locally manufactured solar cells, and offers them special subsidies. This allegedly violates WTO principles that require countries to treat both foreign and domestic goods equally. This isn't India's first move to protect local companies. In November 2012, India began anti-dumping investigations against Chinese, Malaysian, and US firms, following complaints by Indian manufacturers of solar cells that cheap Chinese imports were hurting their business. US and Chinese imports can be brought into the country tax-free, but Indian manufacturers have to pay duties on raw materials to make the same products. H.R Gupta, chairman of Indosolar, one of the companies that filed the complaint, says: \"Local manufacturers are not getting any business, and the solar industry is doing very poorly because of lack of orders.\" Many local manufacturers have stopped production, or are operating at far below normal capacity. In a press conference last week, the Indian Solar Manufacturer's Association flayed lack of support by the government. But it isn't just Indian companies that are worried. Twelve influential green organisations, including the Sierra Club, Greenpeace USA, Action Aid USA and Friends of the Earth, have urged the US to withdraw the complaint, and called for a compromise that allows India to build a solar economy. In a strongly worded letter, the groups pointed out that India's domestic solar industry is critical to global efforts to tackle climate change. The groups also expressed dismay at the idea that climate policy might be determined by trade wars rather than climate science. Things got worse. The 60-day consultation ended on 7 April, and with no sign of a compromise, the US may now ask the WTO to resolve the complaint. India, meanwhile, is not taking things lying down. On 17 April, it retaliated by asking the US to justify trade restrictions in its own renewable energy projects, arguing that incentives offered to U.S. companies to use local labour make it equally difficult for Indian companies to enter the US. In this tit-for-tat game, what's certain is that the environment will be the loser. The Obama Administration is committed to strengthening the American clean energy sector and preserving the millions of jobs it supports,\" said US trade representative Ron Kirk in a statement back in February. A fine sentiment, except when jobs come up against lives. India currently burns a phenomenal amount of coal, which kills tens of thousands prematurely every year. With no viable alternative energy sources, more coal plants are on their way. But forget India for a moment. Can climate change worldwide be resisted, as long as India continues to burn coal at this pace? Unlikely. As green groups have pointed out, behemoths such as India and China need to have every tool at their disposal to make the difficult shift to clean energy. The globe is teetering on the brink. Block India's fledgling solar industry and you may just push the country over, and take the rest of the world with you. • Follow Kavitha on Twitter at @kavitharao"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/jun/01/renewable-energy-clean-cheap-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-01T10:00:08Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy is clean, cheap and here – what's stopping us? | Ashley Seager","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/01/renewable-energy-clean-cheap-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/01/renewable-energy-clean-cheap-uk","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy is clean, cheap and here – what's stopping us?","bodyText":"The report from the Committee on Climate Change arguing that investing in renewable energy would eventually save consumers a lot of money is spot on. We are regularly told by conventional utility companies, many politicians and commentators that energies such as solar and wind are hopelessly expensive and reliant on enormous subsidy. But this is simply wrong. Renewables have seen such dramatic price falls in the past few years that they are threatening to upset the world as we know it and usher in an almost unprecedented boom in the spread of cheap, clean, home-produced energy. Solar will be the cheapest form of power in many countries within just a few years. In places such as California and Italy it has already reached so-called \"grid parity\". Onshore wind, on a piece of land not constrained by years of planning delays, is already the cheapest form of energy on earth. These are not wild claims – those are figures from General Electric, Citibank and others. Solar PV, the area in which my company operates, is a case in point. Three years ago firms like ours were paying about €3,600 per installed kilowatt of solar capacity on barn roofs in Germany. Today it can be done for just over €1,000 – a staggering 70% fall. That is seriously cheap and will just keep getting cheaper. Thanks to a surge in global production to 60 gWp annually, (enough to supply British households – not offices or factories – with all their electricity) solar power has dropped dramatically in price. But there is more to come. Cambridge IP, a global innovation and intellectual property firm, says there is a surge of interest and R&amp;D into two new forms of solar power which are likely to be available commercially by the end of this decade. Newly built solar plants are already considerably cheaper than new nuclear plants per kilowatt hour of electricity produced and we are almost at the stage where we don't need a guaranteed price (known as a feed-in tariff) because solar energy will compete head on with conventional energy. True, there is an ongoing cost from the German government's previous support for solar, but is much lower than the subsidies pumped by the western world into nuclear, coal, oil and gas over the past decades. It is always amazing how a tax cut announced by George Osborne for North Sea oil and gas industry is greeted as somehow being good for Britain whereas any support for renewables is immediately dubbed a subsidy by the conventional energy companies wedded to their dying business model. A tax cut is a subsidy by another name. And remember the estimated £100bn plus cost to future taxpayers of disposing of Britain's dangerous pile of nuclear waste. And solar is starting to pay its subsidy back. Germany now has more than 30 gigaWatt peak (gWp) of solar plants installed, such that on almost all days in the spring, summer and autumn, solar energy surges into the grid at a time when demand is at is strongest (air conditioning etc is running like mad) and when spot market energy prices are at their highest. This peak price is being forced down by solar, helping to reduce wholesale prices. The big energy companies hate this because this peak is where they make their money. Solar in Germany is almost down to wholesale prices – in sunnier countries it already is. This brings me on to a really exciting development . Our company is starting to sell power directly from the barn roofs we have our plants on to the farmers who own the roofs and nearby towns wishing to rescue themselves from the grasp of the RWEs and E.ONs of this world. Why? Because we can produce power at around half of what farmers are paying. This so-called \"distributed\" (ie non-grid) energy is where the real revolution is taking place. Distributed energy not only saves on the huge amount of energy lost in grid distribution, but it helps lighten the load on the grid. Whole German towns are going completely renewable. The citizens get cheaper, cleaner power. If only Britain would get this. Just to be clear – Germany (Europe's biggest economy) now gets 25% of its electricity from renewables – a proportion that is increasing by the month. This is twice the level of the UK, although, interestingly, similar to that of Scotland on its own. Germany is also leading on figuring out how to overcome the problems of \"intermittency\" by storing renewable energy. I agree with the sceptical environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg that much of the world's efforts to reduce emissions in the past couple of decades have been a waste of time. I also agree with him on the need for a surge in R&amp;D to provide a cheap, renewable-energy-powered future. It is just that I think that future is already here, not decades away. And nuclear power is already a thing of the past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2014/apr/28/why-wave-power-has-lagged-far-behind-as-an-energy-source","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-28T15:01:08Z","webTitle":"Why wave power has lagged far behind as an energy source","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/28/why-wave-power-has-lagged-far-behind-as-an-energy-source","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/apr/28/why-wave-power-has-lagged-far-behind-as-an-energy-source","fields":{"headline":"Why wave power has lagged far behind as an energy source","bodyText":"It’s not difficult to imagine what wind energy looks like — by this point we have all seen the towering turbines dotting the landscape. The same goes for solar power and the panels that are spreading across rooftops worldwide. But there is another form of renewable energy, available in huge quantities, that doesn’t really call to mind anything at all: What does wave power technology look like? Wind and solar power have taken off in the past decade or two, as costs have come down rapidly and threats from climate change have made clear the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, numerous studies have concluded that wave power — and to a lesser extent, tidal power — could contribute massive amounts to the overall energy picture. But while the industry has made halting progress, experts agree that it remains decades behind other forms of renewables, with large amounts of money and research required for it to even begin to catch up. No commercial-scale wave power operations now exist, although a small-scale installation did operate off the coast of Portugal in 2008 and 2009. In February, U.S. corporate giant Lockheed Martin announced a joint venture to create the world’s biggest wave energy project, a 62.5-megawatt installation slated for the coast of Australia that would produce enough power for 10,000 homes. Scotland, surrounded by the rough waters of the Atlantic and the North Sea, has become a hotbed of wave-energy research and development, with the government last year approving a 40-megawatt wave energy installation in the Shetland Islands. But a central challenge has proven to be the complexity of harnessing wave power, which has led to a host of designs, including writhing snake-like attenuators, bobbing buoys, even devices mounted discreetly on the ocean floor that work by exploiting differences in pressure as a wave passes by. Some devices generate the electricity on the spot and transmit it via undersea cables to shore, while others pass the mechanical energy of the wave along to land before turning it into electrical energy. Which of these drastically divergent concepts might emerge as a winner is far from clear. “We may not have even invented the best device yet,” said Robert Thresher, a research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. From a technical point of view, operating in the ocean is far more difficult than on land; building offshore wind installations, for example, tends to be significantly more expensive than constructing wind farms onshore. Saltwater is a hostile environment for devices, and the waves themselves offer a challenge for energy harvesting as they not only roll past a device but also bob up and down or converge from all sides in confused seas. This provides enticing opportunities for energy capture, but a challenge for optimum design. “I’d like to be optimistic, but I don’t think realistically I can be,” said George Hagerman, a research associate in the Virginia Tech University’s Advanced Research Institute and a contributor to the U.S. Department of Energy’s assessment of wave energy’s potential. “You’ve got all those cost issues of working in the ocean that offshore wind illustrates, and then you’ve got [an energy] conversion technology that really no one seems to have settled on a design that is robust, reliable, and efficient. With wind, you’re harnessing the energy as a function of the speed of the wind. In wave energy, you’ve not only got the height of the wave, but you’ve got the period of the wave, so it becomes a more complicated problem.” A recurring theme among wave power experts is that wave energy is where wind energy was three decades ago. At that time, engineers had not settled on the optimal design for wind turbines, but decades of ensuing research have resulted in highly sophisticated turbine designs. With wave power, some research occurred after the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, but since then government and commercial research and development into wave power has paled compared to wind and solar energy. As with any energy source, the fundamental roadblock toward more widespread deployment is cost. So far, the wave energy field is filled with small companies picking off small amounts of government funding where they can. It will likely require the participation of some large companies, such as GE or Siemens (both major manufacturers of wind turbines) before wave power really gets rolling, according to numerous experts. Those companies may be waiting for the technology to sort itself out before investing, a common dilemma in any nascent field. In spite of the challenges inherent to the medium, the industry is progressing, albeit slowly. There are a few small wave farms and pilot projects in the water, including Pelamis Wave Power’s first-ever wave farm off the coast of Northern Portugal. That company has a few megawatt-scale wave farms planned, while others, like Ocean Power Technologies, continue to deploy test devices to improve buoy-based technology. Australian company Carnegie Wave plans to commission a “commercial scale” installation near Perth later this year, using a fully submerged device that uses wave power to pump water to shore for conversion to electricity. And there are signs that big-company buy-in is starting, as evidenced by Lockheed Martin’s Australia project, which will use a buoy technology that generates electricity from the rising and falling of waves. Another company, M3 Wave, plans to install a new device just off the Oregon coast this summer. M3 will be using a pressure-based device, sitting out of sight on the ocean floor. As a wave passes over it, air inside the device is pushed by pressure changes from one chamber to another, spinning a turbine to generate electricity. So far, projects producing only a handful of megawatts have actually made it into the water, but experts say the industry needn’t settle on one device before substantial progress occurs. “I wouldn’t be surprised if what we eventually find is there will be a device that we use in deeper water, and a device that we use nearer the shore,” said Belinda Batten, a professor at Oregon State University and the director of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center. The process to refine those technologies is ongoing. The European Marine Energy Centre in Scotland’s Orkney Islands allows companies to connect their devices to existing infrastructure and cabling to test their electricity-generating capabilities and identify problems. Batten said her center based at Oregon State is in the permitting and approval process for a counterpart testing center that will enable companies to connect to the existing electricity grid for testing purposes. The location of those two testing sites is no accident, as they are situated in maritime regions known for energetic waves. The Pacific Northwest and Alaska will likely have a monopoly on the U.S.’s first generation of wave projects, while in Europe the United Kingdom — Scotland in particular — is focusing heavily on wave energy development. The U.K. government says the country could potentially get as much as 75 percent of its energy needs from the waves and tides combined; the U.S. Department of Energy, meanwhile, estimates that wave power in the U.S. could generate as much 1,170 terawatt-hours per year, which is equivalent to more than one quarter of all U.S. electricity consumption. Thresher of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory says that wave power’s first markets may well be in remote places like Alaska, where energy is expensive because of reliance on costly imported fuels like diesel. “There has been an interest in some of the island communities,” Thresher said. With the industry starting to develop larger projects and continuing to test myriad devices in search of the best designs, does that mean wave power could finally be on its way, just as wind was 25 years ago? Jason Busch, executive director of the Oregon Wave Energy Trust — a non-profit group dedicated to helping advance the industry — said that there are too many variables, such as the price of natural gas or eventual passage of a carbon tax, to apply the experience of wind or solar power to a different technology and time period. “In my opinion the biggest issue is the failure to price carbon,” said Busch. “As long as we refuse to internalize the cost of greenhouse gases, then we’re playing on an unlevel playing field.” In spite of the hurdles, though, he thinks that steady technical progress will lead to substantial amounts of grid-connected wave power by 2035. “In the course of 10 years we have gone from having zero wave energy technologies that are even remotely viable to having several in the water, and on the cusp of commercial viability,” Busch said. “We’re making some really good progress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/jan/28/state-of-the-union-obama-tiger-president-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-29T02:39:15Z","webTitle":"State of the Union: is Obama our economic Tiger President?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/28/state-of-the-union-obama-tiger-president-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/28/state-of-the-union-obama-tiger-president-economy","fields":{"headline":"State of the Union: is Obama our economic Tiger President?","bodyText":"It is a trait of perfectionist, immigrant Tiger Mothers, as Amy Chua controversially says, to drag better performance out of their offspring by comparing them unfavorably with their peers. That drives achievement but results in low self-esteem, she claims. Is Obama our Tiger President? Every year, the stage-mother-in-chief mentions some foreign country that's beating us economically, to send a competitive frisson through our collective ranks. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Who's better looking and smarter than us? Here are some highlights. 2009: America is chatty, but doesn't focus on its studies Obama chides that the US, just coming out of a recession, should be alarmed by China, Germany, Japan and even Korea beating us on clean energy. \"We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we’ve fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea.\" 2010: America falling further behind more countries economically Not only is the US still behind China and Germany, but we're even behind bumbling Europe, which that year is in the throes of a crisis, and we've fallen behind India too. \"There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.\" That sounds like bad news. What are we fighting back with, Mr President? Our national pride lay in an unlikely place that year. \"Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services, and information.\" Brutal, but at least we have Tampa, right? But wait, the flogging is not over. A neat train in Tampa will not excuse America's laziness. \"I have one simple question: how long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold? You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China is not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany is not waiting. India is not waiting. These nations – they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America.\" You heard the Tiger President. Go back to your room and study, America. Come back in 2011 with your game face on. 2011: America blows its chance at redemption It's 2011! Let's see your homework, America. What have you got to show for your economic competition? It turns out, America is the back-of-the-classroom slacker of economies. Not only are we still not as good as China, and Europe, and India and Korea, as the President mentioned in all those previous years, but we're also behind Russia. RUSSIA. This is like Rocky IV all over again. \"Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science. They’re investing in research and new technologies. Just recently, China became the home to the world’s largest private solar research facility, and the world’s fastest computer.\" \"Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped. South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports. Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation’s infrastructure, they gave us a 'D.' \"We have to do better. America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System. The jobs created by these projects didn’t just come from laying down track or pavement. They came from businesses that opened near a town’s new train station or the new off-ramp.\" That infrastructure grade of 'D' just hangs tensely in the air. Until next year. 2012: Time for vengeance At this point, the president has become sick of browbeating America about falling behind China. It's time to take action. Some good cop-bad cop action. In 2012, Obama lavished praise on a few countries for buying American stuff and helping the US get closer to its goal of doubling exports: \"Soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.\" All of those countries are good, the president implied, compared to trade villain China. (And Iran, against whom the president pursued some very effective sanctions). Obama announced a Trade Enforcement Unit to crack down on China's trade imbalance with the US and the country's thriving cottage industry in faking US products: \"I will go anywhere in the world to open up new markets for American products. I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors don’t play by the rules. We’ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration – and it’s made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. It’s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It’s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily subsidized. 2013: I know you know. And you know that I know you know Perhaps tired of telling us how we're falling behind every country on earth, the President focuses on two stalwarts: China and Germany. \"Solar energy gets cheaper by the year – let’s drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we.\" \"Let’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges. So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school. They've been trained for the jobs that are there. \" Who's next in 2014? We'll find out tonight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-12T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Global warming and energy – interwined problems in Africa | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa","fields":{"headline":"Global warming and energy – intertwined problems in Africa","bodyText":"Much of my work involves the design and installation of clean and robust energy sources in remote parts of the world. On a recent trip to Kenya, my family had the opportunity to tour the Lake Naivasha region in Kenya. This region contains a treasure of wildlife and was a filming location for the movie \"Out of Africa.\" During a boat ride, we witnessed the impacts on climate change – not through academic journal articles or conference presentations – but through people who see climate change with their own eyes. In past years, Lake Naivasha had seen dramatic reductions in water level. The coastline had changed and plants and animals had adapted to a new normal. Recently, however, extreme rains have raised the waters approximately 4 meters according to our guide. The new waterline had submerged and killed beautiful Acacia trees. After conversations with many other Kenyans, it was apparent that the reliable wet-dry weather patterns had become more erratic; you didn't have to witness dying Acacia trees when farmers throughout the country told similar tales. Extreme weather swings were evident here before our eyes. Kenyan culture (and much of Africa) is deeply rooted in the patterns of weather and climate; much of their economy depends on agricultural production. That dependency has given them much clearer foresight than others about how to plan for the changed future. The entirety of Kenya has awakened to the threats of climate change, including the government, agricultural sectors, energy industries and the educational system. My journey to learn more about Kenya's plans brought me to the beautiful and large Kenyatta University campus, just northeast of Nairobi. There, very new and quickly growing programs in mechanical engineering, energy and sustainability, and agricultural engineering are just a few of the programs training tomorrow's technology leaders to make an impact solving today's problems. Among the many initiatives are goals to provide clean, renewable, and robust energy for the campus and the country. Some applications they are focusing on are wind-powered water-pumping systems. The plan is to design, manufacture, install, and service small-scale wind power systems that slowly pump water into elevated storage tanks throughout the day and night. Students, faculty, and staff draw the water is drawn down, typically during morning and evening hours. The prototype wind turbine will be adapted to manufacturing techniques used locally, near the university. It is hoped that wide-scale testing of the wind turbine system will occur over the next three years and thereafter, fast market penetration throughout Africa will be inevitable. Another emerging technology coming from Kenyatta is the use of novel technologies for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). By using thermochemical sorption technologies, sometimes with solar heating, Dr. Jeremiah Kiplagat (recent recipient of the African Education Leadership Outstanding Professor Award) and his colleagues are setting the framework for improving the performance of refrigeration systems using these methodologies. As a third example, a series of faculty-led student projects have been completed to develop solar concentrating and tracking systems for heat generation and photovoltaic power generation. The research teams have developed effective and simple means of moving reflecting mirrors and parabolic concentrators with the sun throughout the day to increase the amount of absorbed solar energy and increase the efficiency of the overall system. While the faculty and staff are at the forefront in technology development projects such as these, much credit must be given to the administration. With implementation of new degrees such as doctoral programs in sustainability and masters programs in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering hydrology, and biomedical engineering, with a focus on solving the energy and health problems that are prevalent in the East African region, this university, and the country as a whole are destined to remain leaders in their geographical region. It is clear from formal academic studies and from anecdotal evidence that developing countries that rely upon agriculture will suffer greatly from climate change in the coming decades. It is hence apparent that the solutions to climate change, such as accelerated implementation of clean and renewable power, must be implemented with great wisdom so that people in these regions are able to access the same low-cost electricity that other nations have enjoyed. In this regard, the climate-energy problem is often thought of as a double-edged sword – solutions to the climate problem make access to low-cost electricity more difficult. Currently, the major source of energy in Kenya is hydropower. This is why the School of Engineering at Kenyatta University has also partnered with regional and international organizations to promote climate mitigation in water and energy sectors. An example is the research being carried out by Dr. Luke Olang in collaboration with IGAD climate center on developing a drought-monitoring tool for the greater horn of Africa in general. The same research team is also actively involved in water management strategies in the vulnerable Mara River Basin, considered a World Heritage site due to the Great Annual Wildebeest Migration. What Kenyatta University is showing the world is that it is possible to solve both the energy and the climate problems together. Novel energy solutions using locally available technology and manufacturing techniques can build economies, provide low-cost energy, and preserve the future climate for our children. This type of systematic planning and dedication gives me hope that our future climate and energy problems can be solved. Perhaps the vision is best expressed by Prof. Chris Shisanya, Dean School of Humanities and Social Sciences who told me, \"We at Kenyatta University have decided to prepare our students early enough during their study programmes to confront the challenges posed by climate change. We are now offering such courses as MSc. (Integrated Watershed Management) and MSc. (Climate Change and Sustainable Development), whose main focus is on adaptation to climate change. We believe that by exposing our students to such knowledge, they will be better equipped to help communities in Kenya's rural landscapes enhance their resilience to climate change impacts.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2013/aug/17/lucy-mangan-fracking","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-17T08:00:53Z","webTitle":"Lucy Mangan: fracking idiots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/17/lucy-mangan-fracking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/17/lucy-mangan-fracking","fields":{"headline":"Lucy Mangan: fracking idiots","bodyText":"We are all, I know, just marking time until the Oprah Winfrey interview with Lindsay Lohan takes place. So let us while away the tedious, meaningless hours by talking about fracking. This, as I'm sure you are aware unless you have elected to move to the bunker early (possibly when the Winfrey-Lohan news broke), is the process of drilling holes in the ground and forcing water down them at such high pressure that it fractures the shale rock beneath, releasing gas. They do it a lot in America and David Cameron wants to do it here – starting with West Sussex, where test drilling by energy firm Cuadrilla has begun, despite protests. Lord Howell, former government energy adviser, shale gas lobbyist and George Osborne's father-in-law, had recommended using the \"desolate north-east\" for exploratory operations (later amended to the \"unloved north-west\", at which point someone presumably bundled him under the scullery stairs before he could suggest blowing up Scotland to put the poor Pictish folk out of their misery). But evidently someone thought that fracking up the south instead would add to the sense that \"we're all in this together\" – as indeed it will, when drilling drains the last dregs of Tory sympathy from the home counties more swiftly and surely than it will their gas reserves, and the good burghers of Sussex join the rest of the country in loathing its leader. There are countless problems with fracking, most of which can be summarised as: we are not America. When you get the urge to start fracturing rocks in the US, you can go somewhere large and empty, so that if the acknowledged risks – earthquakes, methane leaks and water pollution (sometimes the latter two come together, resulting in water you can set fire to, a great trick for children's parties in Nebraska for as long as there are still unpoisoned children to attend them) – are realised, they affect only a small portion of your country. A small portion being one perhaps the size of the UK, for example. Do you see where I'm going with this? Apart from its tiny and densely populated landscape (even the desolate north-east is no Wyoming), the UK suffers from having no on-shore drilling industry. That's why Dallas wasn't made in Droitwich. The expense of developing such an industry tips the balance against an already weak economic case for fracking. How can fracking dramatically lower gas prices for the UK as claimed when we're so enmeshed with international markets that our pitiful handful of derricks can have no effect? Meanwhile Germany ploughs its money into the transition to renewables, so that when we are all finally hogtied by waning supplies, rising prices and carbon emission quotas, and can no longer burn all the things we want to burn, they will have a panoply of established alternatives: harnessing (endless! free!) wind, (endless! free!) waves and (endless! free!) solar energy. Also, governments should never support something that has a name so semantically suggestive. It means that even people who might not have been moved to speak will get involved just for the pleasing payoff.

The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami followed by nuclear crisis at Fukushima threatened the country's industrial capacity, its economic status and the safety of millions of its people. However, the decision to award the 2020 Olympics to Tokyo has lent a polish to the country's steady recovery. The International Olympic Committee approved Tokyo as a safe, economically viable host with a vision for a successful event. As the world's third largest economy and a global research and development champion, Japan's importance as a trade partner can't be underestimated. More than 450 British companies already have a presence in the country, and new opportunities will undoubtedly present themselves as the decade unfolds. British exporters to Japan, in fields as diverse as advanced manufacturing and food and beverages, will benefit from this country's solid reputation as a producer of quality goods. But they will also find that the surest way to build a bridge to a new partner is to speak to them in a language they not only understand but feel most comfortable with. In Japan this is particularly relevant. Fluent English speakers are few and far between, and a 2011 Reuters report noted that in a survey of white-collar workers, only 9% claimed to be able to communicate in English. Reaching out to new markets involves unpicking the locks of language and culture. Every accent and nuance shapes the message and either adds value to the brand or subtracts from it. Where a professional translator will be bicultural as well as bilingual, the amateur (or worse, the machine) will not only fail to open the door but may add enough bolts and padlocks to keep it closed forever. Linguistic traps are everywhere. While Japan itself is preparing for an exciting future, the Japanese language has no future tense. The present tense is used to describe future action, and when people speak of watching a TV programme or walking a dog they could be referring to the activity of the moment, something they do each day or something they plan for an unspecified point in the future. A skilled translator will be able to gauge precise meaning from context, just as he or she will be alert to subtle variations in style and culture. Hosting the Olympics may be a once in a lifetime event but on almost any weekend Tokyo and Osaka will be hosts to high-profile trade exhibitions, and the countless UK delegates in attendance will lean heavily on translation and interpreting services. Communicate poorly and you can look very foolish with clients. Communicate well and your entire business can be transformed. The energy sector offers a useful snapshot of the opportunities available in Japan. Prior to March 2011, nuclear reactors generated 30% of all the country's power, but with all 50 of its operational reactors lying idle after Fukushima, a re-evaluation was inevitable. While no one should gloat over another country's energy crisis, British companies that can help it deal with the problem should not feel guilty about turning an honest profit from the exercise. Japan is making a virtue of this economic necessity. Environmentally friendly initiatives have opened trade opportunities in renewable energy, with goals of 20% of all power from renewable sources being set. Wind, biomass and solar PV services are increasingly popular, with demand growing for smart grid and smart metering technology. Prime minister Shinzo Abe's government has heavily incentivised the generation of renewable power, and Hokkaido has become home to a string of solar energy projects. Helping clients to rebuild a brand in a new language is a challenge we relish, but for a country to rebuild itself from the rubble is something to be particularly admired. This decade may have begun with disaster but the next will launch with Japan hosting the greatest show on earth. We wish it well.

The German-owned company, which supplies power to 4.8m households and 500,000 businesses, reported profits of £273m in the first six months of the year, up from £238m the year before. The earnings boost comes after the company raised energy bills by 8.7%, taking the average bill to £1,261 a year. Britain's six biggest energy companies, including E.ON, were recently criticised by MPs for a lack of transparency over their prices. Tony Cocker, E.ON's UK chief executive, insisted the company had delivered a \"fair\" profit. \"The colder start to the year meant more energy has been used, so sales are up. The costs we control have come down at a time when those we don't control are continuing to rise – meaning that ultimately whilst our profit has increased slightly our overall supply profit margin is very much in line with last year.\" The company also benefited from the late start to summer with sales rising by 10%, thanks particularly to the low temperatures in March. Earnings from its power generation business fell by more than half to £159m, mainly as a result of the closure of the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent. The company reports profits by calculating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda). E.ON UK said gas-fired power stations were generating \"very low profit margins\", a trend that pushed down pre-tax earnings across the group by 15% to €5.7bn (£4.9bn) for the first half of this year. Group chief executive Johannes Teyssen warned investors that \"no recovery is in sight\", as low wholesale prices and falling demand for gas-generated power weigh on the business. \"Our traditional generation business is suffering from low capacity utilisation and excessively low wholesale prices,\" he wrote in a letter to shareholders. \"These adverse factors will continue, and according to our analysis, may actually get worse.\" E.ON announced last month that it would mothball an unprofitable gas-fired power plant in Malženice, Slovakia, barely two years after the €400m plant went into service. \"These kinds of decisions are never easy,\" Teyssen wrote. \"Unless the business environment of the energy industry in our core European markets changes tangibly, other plant closures will be unavoidable.\" The growing supply of renewable energy, which has priority access to the grid, has meant traditional fossil-fuel plants are not always operating at their maximum potential. E.ON said that its profitable renewable business continued to grow, but not fast enough to offset the decline in earnings from gas. Renewable energy sales rose 3% to €1.3bn in the first half of the year, driven by expansion in its wind and solar energy business. E.ON is a co-owner of the world's largest wind farm, the London Array, which is located just off the Kent and Suffolk coast and able to meet the annual electricity needs of 750,000 homes, following its official launch in July. Further renewable energy projects are in the pipeline. In April E.ON began laying the sandbag foundations for the Amrumbank wind farm in the North Sea. It has also recently put its first US solar farms into service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/09/innovate-die-fresh-thinking-change-world","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-09T18:54:00Z","webTitle":"Innovate or die: what it takes to transform global health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/09/innovate-die-fresh-thinking-change-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/09/innovate-die-fresh-thinking-change-world","fields":{"headline":"Innovate or die: what it takes to transform global health","bodyText":"Rather than tightly controlled industrial scale projects, in the developing world at least, some of the more interesting, impactful healthcare innovations are coming from lone innovators working at the \"long tail\" of problems. Not only are few multinationals present in these developing markets, many just don't understand them – or even worse they don't understand why they need to be in them. It's innovation in this long tail that is most interesting – a place where people innovate out of necessity, not luxury, and as a matter of survival or ethics, not profit or markets. Often it is a brutal environment but one that would-be social entrepreneurs must acknowledge before setting out. 'Reluctant' health innovation More often than not, innovators in the developing world end up fixing something they never realised was a problem but were suddenly compelled to tackle. This is especially evident in the field of healthcare. While researching a new book on innovation, it became apparent to me that six of the 10 chapters would cover health. The issues they address include data collection, genetic disorders, communications between community health workers, patents, access to medicines, and solar energy as a lighting solution for maternity wards. The range of examples shows how broad and complex an issue health is, as well as the sheer scale of the need for improvement in the developing world. The story of obstetrician Laura Stachel is a fantastic example of unplanned innovation. Stachel's organisation – We Care Solar – designs portable solar lighting kits for maternity wards in developing countries. When she first arrived in Nigeria she planned to work on a different problem altogether, but quickly realised that a simple lack of lighting in rural areas was responsible for an unacceptable number of mother and child deaths. Maternal mortality rates in Nigeria are among the highest in the world, with a ratio of 1,100 maternal deaths occurring for every 100,000 live births, so she turned her attention to helping design, build and distribute solar-powered lighting kits to help solve it. Solar suitcases are now saving the lives of thousands of mothers and babies throughout the developing world. Some would call what Laura did accidental innovation. But an accident implies that luck played a major part – a suggestion that fails to do justice to a difficult journey with many sacrifices and obstacles to be overcome. This is the side of social entrepreneurship that many don't see. The years of solitude spent pushing others towards your goal, the decision to place yourself in harm's way (as in Stachel's case), and the constant threat of failure. Most social innovation ventures run out of money, time, or willpower. Although the rewards of a successful career as a social entrepreneur can be significant, for all the romance of the discipline it is often a difficult, frustrating and lonely journey. Few people in the world of social entrepreneurship ever set out with the aim of becoming rich, and as I discovered, some start out through serendipity. Fostering innovation Serendipity is all very well but we cannot rely on it. Governments, organisations and businesses can play their part in encouraging the opportunities and core values that foster social entrepreneurship. In the social innovation world we talk a lot about project sustainability, but little about human sustainability. If we're to have any chance of ongoing success in our battle against the many problems facing society then we need to attract the brightest young minds to the field, and then give them all the support they need to keep them there. Establishing university or after-work courses on social innovation helps, but we are in danger of institutionalising social entrepreneurship. Social change isn't a well thought-out, orderly process. The key is helping driven people fulfil their ideas. By encouraging cultural awareness, teaching current affairs and running travel-based initiatives such as student placements abroad will help the right people find the problems they are best able to solve. You wouldn't get to experience developing world maternal care in London, Paris or New York but you will by following Stachel's lead and by spending time on the ground in west Africa. The innovator's code Although social entrepreneurship can't be boxed-up, shelved and sold, certain advice can be offered to help others tread a successful path to impactful innovation: • Don't assume you need money to grow. Passion is the main lifeblood of innovation and will help inspire others to join you. • Suppress your ego, stay humble and remain curious. • Collaborate – if it's in the best interests of solving the problem at hand, even if it's not in your interests. Remember the bigger picture. • Are you the best person to solve the problem? Be honest, and if not, go and support the work of someone else who is. With the spread of the internet and mobile technology, there has never been a better time for the developed world to equip its people with the awareness, tools and experiences needed to solve the planet's pressing social and environmental problems. Today's reluctant innovators have paved the way and shown tomorrow's entrepreneurs that the only qualifications needed to change the world are faith, passion and determination.

It's not just for enthusiasts. It has potential to be a significant source of energy.\" Barker's comments were made in response to a report issued today by the Solar Trade Association (STA), which claims the government and its advisers have underestimated the benefits and overestimated the costs of solar energy. \"While I wouldn't necessarily concur with all the specific recommendations of the report,\" Barker said, \"there is one clear message that I do agree with: that solar has far more potential than has previously been thought.\" Despite these statements, Barker plans to press ahead with plans to slash the subsidy given to large-scale solar installations via the feed-in tariff scheme (Fits) – a move that the STA chairman, Howard Johns, claims could \"decapitate\" or even \"destroy\" Britain's fledgling solar industry. Asked how he can reconcile his statements about solar's potential with the cuts to the Fits, Barker replied: \"I'd like to be able to be more generous with the large-scale projects, but I've got £860m from the spending review … so the focus of the current scheme needs to be on the small scale, to get the maximum number of installations. But we now need to think creatively about how we can engage commercial-scale solar as a more important part of the energy mix … we've got to find additional pathways – and that means changing the way that solar is perceived in the department.\" The report also claims that the government and its advisers – the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) – have misunderstood the economics of solar power. In its recent renewable energy review, the committee advised the government that solar's role in the coming decade \"should be limited\" due to \"current high costs and limited UK impact on global costs\". Britain may do better to \"buy in [solar panels] from overseas later\", the CCC concluded. The STA claims this analysis is flawed because unless the UK solar industry continues to scale up, there won't be the capacity to actually install large quantities of panels as prices drop. In addition, the report argues that solar is already much less expensive than the CCC suggests. In their analysis, the CCC compares the cost of solar electricity with the wholesale price of generating power from sources such as gas and nuclear. This is an \"apples with pears\" comparison, according to the STA, because most of the final costs to the consumer of nuclear and gas power are accounted for by transmission and supplier profits, not generation. In contrast, solar delivers energy directly to buildings and therefore should instead be compared with the retail power price, according to the STA – a change that would slash solar's perceived cost. A spokesperson for the CCC disagreed with this claim: \"The argument runs that solar PV does not need to use the power network, and therefore that investment in solar PV saves network costs. However, given that we will continue to have power networks, and that the costs associated with these are mainly fixed, there is only very limited network cost saving – due to avoided network losses - from investing in solar PV. So when considering the economics of solar PV from the perspective of UK plc, the relevant comparator is the wholesale price.\" Barker said that he agreed with the CCC that \"even if you install a huge amount of solar, you're still going to want access to the grid\", but he acknowledged that \"there is clearly a point in what [the STA] say. Solar is different from other technologies and that needs to be recognised. We need a more sophisticated level of analysis.\" Another key point of debate is the rate at which solar prices will come down and how soon the technology will be able to compete on cost without subsidy – so-called grid parity. Today's report cites recent research by consultants A T Kearney that suggests grid parity will arrive by 2019 in the UK, and much sooner in some other European countries. But the CCC expects solar to remain expensive for much longer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/may/01/may-day-workers-of-the-world-unite-and-take-over-their-factories","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-01T05:00:04Z","webTitle":"May Day: workers of the world unite and take over – their factories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/01/may-day-workers-of-the-world-unite-and-take-over-their-factories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/may/01/may-day-workers-of-the-world-unite-and-take-over-their-factories","fields":{"headline":"May Day: workers of the world unite and take over – their factories","bodyText":"A 19th-century slogan is getting a 21st-century makeover. The workers of the world really are uniting. At least, some of them are. The economic meltdown unleashed by the 2008 financial crisis hit southern Europe especially hard, sending manufacturing output plunging and unemployment soaring. Countless factories shut their gates. But some workers at perhaps as many as 500 sites across the continent – a majority in Spain, but also in France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey – have refused to accept the corporate kiss of death. By negotiation, or sometimes by occupation, they have taken production into their own hands, embracing a movement that has thrived for several years in Argentina. In France, an average of 30 mostly small companies a year, from phone repair firms to ice-cream makers, have become workers’ co-operatives since 2010. Coceta, a co-operative umbrella group in Spain, reckons that in 2013 alone some 75 Spanish companies were taken over by their former employees – roughly half the total in the whole of Europe. A gathering in Marseille last year of representatives from worker-controlled factories drew more than 200 delegates from more than a dozen countries – including pioneers from Argentina, whose turn-of-the-century economic crash sparked a wave of fabricas recuperadas that today has left around 15,000 workers in charge at more than 300 workplaces. The fast-developing phenomenon is now a field of academic study; there are websites, such as workerscontrol.net and autogestion.coop, dedicated to it. No two self-managed ventures launch in the same circumstances, and many face daunting obstacles: bureaucratic inertia and administrative red tape that can delay or even prevent production; legal opposition from former owners; a still-chilly economic climate; outdated machinery, or products no longer in demand. Lifelong union militants can find themselves, for the first time in their lives, making tough commercial decisions. But many – for the time being at least – are making it work. France: ‘We decided to fight’ Twenty minutes’ drive from the old port of Marseille, on a green and well-groomed industrial park outside the Provençal village of Gémenos, is Fralib, the largest tea factory in France. Every year, 250-odd workers here turned six tonnes of carefully cured leaves into more than 2bn sachets of Lipton and Eléphant brand flavoured and scented teas – lemon, mint, Earl Grey – and soothing herbal infusions: linden, camomile, verbena. But in September 2010, having spent five years steadily shifting half the factory’s production to Poland, its owner, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever, summarily announced it was closing the site. “It was … shocking,” said Olivier Lerberquier, a CGT union convenor at the factory. “Unilever France had just paid a huge dividend to shareholders. Fralib, this place, was profitable, even at half capacity. We decided to fight.” It has been, by any standards, a long battle, but it seems nearly over: next month, 57 ex-Fralib employees, now reformed into a self-managed workers’ co-op, will switch on their machines again, and a factory silent for half a decade will once more produce tea. Standing four-square in the cavernous main production hall at Gémenos, as long-underemployed operators checked pristine machinery and freshly trained technicians tested new quality-control equipment, Leberquier said few in France would have bet on the factory’s remaining workers getting this far. “In the end, though, the length of the fight – 1,336 days, it was – almost helped us,” he said. “We got time to build solidarity, and a solid business plan. And even if, like our lawyer says, we’re now ‘condemned to succeed’, at least we know, for sure, that we have as good a chance as anyone.” The workers also got money. Unilever submitted four successive redundancy plans for the 182 people still employed at Fralib in 2010. All – including one proposal to relocate to Poland on an annual salary of €6,000 – were thrown out by the employment tribunal in Marseille. While more than half the workers, exhausted, eventually accepted a payoff, those who held out to the end were rewarded: first, the greater Marseille authority, keen to preserve jobs, agreed to buy the factory site from Unilever for €5m and pay a symbolic extra euro for the machinery. Then in June last year, the company agreed a remarkable €20m settlement to cover compensation for all unpaid wages, retraining, market research, brand promotion – and €1.5m of startup capital for the new business. “I won’t lie – it was hard,” said Xavier Imbernou, a machine operator retraining in quality control and food safety. “We went months without pay; dug deep into our savings. Whole families suffered. But we had such support, from around the country. Our struggle became symbolic.” Marie Sasso, who has been filling little sachets with Eléphant tea – the brand was first made near Marseille St Charles station in 1896 – since she was 17, said she never expected to find herself without a job at 55, “and never for a moment considered not fighting for it”. She said she was “counting the days till the machines restart. All this time we’ve been maintaining them, running them once a month to see they’re working. This time, when they start, it’ll be for us. No bosses. That’s what kept us going.” The Société Coopérative et Participative Thés et Infusions, or SCOP-TI, as the new venture is known, failed in two of its early objectives: Unilever rejected its suggestion that the factory continue to supply it with bulk tea on contract, and it refused to surrender the Eléphant brand. “We had to rethink, radically,” said Leberquier. The co-op’s new plan has it processing 350 tonnes of tea and infusions this year and 500-600 tonnes by 2017: enough to pay its members a fair wage. It is negotiating contracts with French supermarkets to supply fairtrade teas under their own labels, but is also developing a more upmarket own-brand range. “These are premium, organic, local or regional products,” said Leberquier. “The south of France used to produce 400 tonnes of linden a year; now it mostly comes from Latin America and the harvest here is barely 15 tonnes a year. We’ve already signed deals that will bring Provençal orchards back to life.” The former Fralib workers’ road to self-management has involved almost everyone learning something new. “You have to realise: we did production,” said Gerard Cazorla, 57, along with Leberquier a leading light in the struggle, and recently elected president of the co-op. “Purchasing, transport, marketing, sales, distribution – all of that was Unilever’s responsibility.” Roles have been decided “democratically, and actually quite naturally”, he said, through a horizontal structure of frequent general assemblies and an elected (and instantly dismissable) 11-person managing board. Some debates – salaries all equal or reflecting professional expertise? – have been tougher than others, Cazorla conceded. And the more militant members of the new co-operative – among them, he would be the first to admit, himself – have had to adjust to some uncomfortable realities. There was disquiet, for example, at the necessity of working directly with France’s famously ruthless big supermarket chains, and soul-searching at the prospect of a self-employed sales team working essentially on commission. “We have to be pragmatic,” Cazorla said. “Sometimes I have to take my union cap off. We have a big factory to run and 60 salaries to pay. We’re not going to change society. There’s still going to be capitalism. But we try to do what we’re doing as best we can, and according to our values.” Jon Henley Spain: ‘This was new for us’ In a small green space tucked between tall apartment buildings, two teenage girls giggle self-consciously as they begin singing softly into their microphones. A crowd forms around them, clapping along as the videographer calls out instructions. This hastily formed band is recording a video tribute to their city’s music school, which for five years has offered drum, piano and band lessons, among others, to around 800 students in Mataró, a small city 20 miles from Barcelona. Most music schools wouldn’t elicit a tribute, but Mataró is different. In 2012, the school was on the brink of closure, a victim of changing political priorities and cutbacks driven by Spain’s economic crisis. As the school’s 40 teachers prepared for imminent unemployment, the students and their families took to the streets to demand that local authorities kept the school open. Finally a compromise was reached: the school would continue but its management would be privatised. With little to lose, the school’s teachers decided to bid for the contract. “We just threw it together,” said piano teacher Aradia Sánchez de la Blanca. “The motivation was so pressing and the rage over everything we had been through was so intense that we started going down this path without thinking too much about the next steps.” From this kneejerk reaction Musicop was born, a co-operative that marries together music education and co-operative values. Their elation at winning the tender soon gave way to panic. “We went from basically being teachers to being members in a co-op,” said Sánchez de la Blanca. “All of a sudden we had to think about how we were going to organise ourselves, manage our finances - this was new for most of us.” Most members had no idea what it meant to be in a co-op, said teacher Montse Anguera Gisbert. “The first year involved a lot of swearing,” she said laughing. The co-operative is now in its third year and despite the steep learning curve and the country’s economic crisis, it is growing. Today the co-op offers classes to nearly 2,000 students in seven municipalities, bringing music education to students who range from 36 months old to octogenarians. The backbone of their growing enterprise is their monthly assemblies, where everything from management to expansion opportunities is on the table. To meet their obligation, Musicop has taken on another 40 or so part-time workers. Once there is enough fulltime work for these workers, the hope is that they can become members of the co-operative. As Musicop’s members grapple with the challenges of self-management, they have relied extensively on the resources around them. About a year ago, Musicop set up offices in Can Fugarolas, a repurposed car dealership and repair shop that now serves as headquarters for several other co-ops dealing in everything from solar energy to consumer goods – along with other community groups. The city of Mataró boasts a rich history of co-operatives, said Ignasi Gómez, president of Musicop. “The first co-operative launched here in the late 1800s,” he said, citing a co-op dedicated to construction launched in 1887. “Co-operatives are part of the local culture on many levels.” Spain today is home to some 18,000 co-operatives, a vibrant movement whose international face has often been that of Mondragon, one of the world’s biggest workers’ co-operatives. Founded by local priests in the Basque country in the 1950s, Mondragon today employs nearly 75,000 people and racked up global sales of more than €11.6bn in 2013. “Mondragon offers inspiration on what’s possible,” said Paloma Arroyo, of Coceta, a group that represents co-operatives in Spain. In 2013 alone, she said, some 75 companies across Spain were turned into co-operatives by their workers, out of 150 companies across Europe. On a Friday afternoon, Musicop’s teachers were spread out across Mataró, offering classes in four places. In a quiet primary school, pianos had been crammed into a small room where three girls were learning to play the theme song from Frozen. Elsewhere, another teacher had his hands full with eight pre-schoolerslearning the basics of rhythm in a class called Music and Movement. In an abandoned school that hosts many of Musicop’s classes in Mataró, more than a dozen pre-teens sang and waved their hands in the air as they wandered around a room singing along to Vivaldi. For 16-year-old Aida Garcia, the classes offer a window into a world she would have never known otherwise. “I love being in these classes,” she said, adding that her dream was to play clarinet in an orchestra. Propelled by the enthusiasm of their students, Musicop’s members have pushed forward, even though salaries dropped by 30% initially. They have begun climbing back up, and are now about 12% shy of what they were before, said Gómez. “The salaries we make are respectable, but not ideal,” he added. Even so, few members hesitate when asked if it was worth it. “We’re better off today, because we’re empowered,” said Gómez. Ashifa Kassam Greece: ‘This is about equality’ Marius Kostopoulos was painstakingly dripping lemon essential oil into the 300-odd plastic bottles that he and his three colleagues had spent the past hour or so filling with all-purpose liquid household cleaner. This was not the job he was taken on to do in 2004 at Viome, a once highly profitable manufacturer of building supplies – ceramic tile adhesives and grouts, to be precise – on the industrial outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second city. But Viome no longer really exists. Faced with the near-total collapse of the Greek construction industry, a consequent 40% slump in sales and a 30% increase in energy costs, its parent company, Philkeram-Johnson – majority owned by the local Philippou family– went spectacularly bust four years ago. Kostopoulos and his 45 fellow production workers were already working shorter hours. In May 2011, their pay cheques stopped coming (although they have never officially been made redundant, meaning they are deprived of even minimal Greek jobless benefits). Then in September that year, Philkeram-Johnson simply abandoned the site. So Kostopoulos and 20 of his colleagues are occupying its echoing, increasingly rundown machine halls and warehousing and – for the time being, at least – making a bit of money. “It certainly isn’t enough to survive on,” said Kostopoulos, whose wife, a daycare worker, is now at home looking after their 16-month-old son. “I need other work to get by, so I help out on evenings and weekends as a waiter at weddings, bar mitzvahs, that kind of thing. Other people’s festivities … But it’s up to half the €500 or €600 we live on each month. I couldn’t do without it.” When Philkeram-Johnson left, the workers’ first thought was to prevent the machinery and stock being taken by the company. If that disappeared, they feared, there would be no chance of them ever seeing the €1.5m they were owed in backpay and compensation. But what they really wanted, from the outset, was simply to keep working. “No one wants to be unemployed,” said Dimitris Koumatsioulis, 45, another ex-worker and founding co-operative member. “In Greece in particular, here and now, we couldn’t have another 45 workers unemployed, another 45 families deprived of an income.” At the very first of their general assemblies, a proposal to stay on in the factory and run it as a self-managed co-operative won 97% approval. A delegation of workers went to Athens for talks with the employment ministry; the Philippou family, majority owners of Philkeram-Johnson, made it clear they did not envisage restarting production on the site. By mid-2012 the Viome workers had contacted solidarity networks in Greece and abroad, exploring the possibility of producing a range of environmentally friendly soaps, washing-up liquids, softeners and detergents. The products had to be cheap to make, using existing machinery and raw materials that were simple to source. Local citizens’ associations and unions promised to distribute a proportion of the factory’s output, followed by many of the dozens of small co-operative stores and markets then starting to spring up around Greece as the country’s formal economy spiralled downwards. In February 2013, after a three-day solidarity event in Thessaloniki that included a benefit concert attended by more than 6,000 people, production at Viome restarted under the workers’ control, and in April last year a court recognised them as a legally constituted, not-for-profit social co-operative. Viome products are now sold through charity and solidarity networks in Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. Its co-operative statutes, which emphasise the key principles of collective decision-making and ownership, refer to the venture’s “solidarity supporters”: organisations and individuals who have pledged to purchase a percentage of the factory’s output every year. The co-operative has fought a series of court cases against Philkeram-Johnson and the Philippou family, who have repeatedly said they have no plans to use the factory themselves but now want to sell the land to pay off outstanding debts to banks, suppliers and employees. Greece’s new radical left government is considering legislation allowing workers to legally take over factories abandoned by their owners. But ultimately, said Koumatsioulis: “We don’t want to hide it: above and beyond our own jobs and our families’ futures, this is about equality, democracy, the whole employer-employee relationship.” If Viome eventually succeeded in its target of producing up to a tonne a day of soaps, detergents and cleaning fluids, said Kostopoulos, “we’ll be better off here – psychologically, politically, economically – than we ever were when we had bosses. We’re working for each other. That’s the difference”. Jon Henley Argentina: ‘At first it was rough’ All his life José Pereyra had been a waiter. For 20 years he served tables at Los Chanchitos (The Little Piggies), an old-style parrila (grill) at a strategic corner in Buenos Aires, on the borderline between two of the most densely populated middle-class neighbourhoods of the city. Specialising in finger-licking grilled pork and generous helpings of homemade pasta, and with a faithful clientele that had kept it in business for three decades, Pereyra expected Los Chanchitos to provide firm job security. But two years ago Pereyra realised its proprietors, who owned four other restaurants, were heading for a crash. “They owed rent on the building, they owed us back wages and had fallen behind on our social benefits payments,” said Pereyra. “I realised they were planning to close Los Chanchitos behind our backs.” In previous decades, there would have been little Pereyra could have done to save his own job and that of his 27 other co-workers. But after Argentina’s cataclysmic economic collapse in 2001, when the country defaulted on its massive foreign debt and the government impounded all bank savings accounts, so many firms went into bankruptcy that workers were forced to find innovative solutions to save their jobs. “Faced with the closures, instead of folding their arms and going home, many workers took the decision to form co-operatives,” said Andrés Quintana, spokesperson for CNCT, the National Confederation of Work Co-operatives. Worker-managed firms existed before the crash. “There are probably between 5,000 and 6,000 co-operatives in Argentina today,” said Quintana. “The largest growth has been in recent years.” They provide jobs for more than 60,000 people. For many, such as Pereyra, who worked the night shift at Los Chanchitos, forming a co-operative was a matter of survival. “I remember the date, 23 April 2013, I spent all afternoon wandering around trying to figure out what to do,” Pereyra recalled. “The owners were pulling out and we had to take a decision. That night I called together all the waiters and the rest of the staff and proposed forming a co-operative.” The restaurant’s employees kept the takings from that night and the next day, but when the meat and vegetable suppliers arrived, Pereyra took his first brave step. He informed the suppliers that the employees had taken over the restaurant and that daily deliveries would be paid in cash from then on. The switch is not an easy one. “It’s a very difficult process for workers,” said Quintana. “Some are suddenly thrust from behind the counter to putting on a suit and going to work out a deal with the bank.” “The first months were very rough, I was a traumatic wreck,” confessed Pereyra, 50. “But we had no other choice, our jobs were at stake. Many of us were over 45and would have had a hard time finding work again. For the first nine months I had to sleep at Los Chanchitos to get the business on its feet.” On a larger scale, the workers at the large Bernardi oil storage plant in the Dock Sud area of the port of Buenos Aires were forced to take the firm over after it went bankrupt as Argentina’s economy imploded 14 years ago. “It was a typical case of a company that collapsed during the 2001 crisis,” said José Sancha, of Decosur, the 30-member co-operative that now runs the formerly privately owned plant. Decosur stores gas oil, petrol and fuel oil that is unloaded from tankers arriving at Buenos Aires in its 42 tanks with a combined capacity of 39,000 cubic metres. “The first years were very tough,” Sancha recalled. “It’s an activity that requires meeting strict environmental norms, dealing with very diverse clients and securing the necessary concessions with the port authorities.” But once the switch had been completed, business blossomed for the new cooperative. “We have now expanded to include an adjacent lot owned by another firm and we have even put in a pipe that connects us directly to the Dock Sud power plant,” said Sancha. Decosur now pipes liquid fuel to the 775-megawatt plant that feeds electric energy to a large slice of Buenos Aires. Umbrella groups such as CNCT have stepped in to smooth the bumpy transition. “We provide training tools, we set up networks, many firms have fallen by the wayside,” said Quintana. “The most complicated part for us was the legal settlement with the previous owners,” said Pereyra, who continues waiting at tables despite his new business role. A pleasant surprise that followed after the co-operative took over was the return of many clients lost as the quality of the food dropped when the previous owners stopped reinvesting in the restaurant. “If you stop paying your cook on time and you lower the quality of the meat, the client notices straight away. But when they saw that things started improving after we took over they started coming back.” Unlike a normal business, which must turn a profit for its owner, a co-operative run by its workers tends to provide better conditions for its employees. “We don’t retire our older employees, we find other tasks for them,” Pereyera said. “One of us needed surgery which he couldn’t afford, for example. So we got together between us and decided that the co-operative would cover the operation, because he had been working at the restaurant for 20 years. As a matter of fact, he just had the operation yesterday. A normal business maybe wouldn’t have cared, but we did.” Uki Goni Turkey: ‘We like coming to work now’ At a first glance, the workshop appears to be a run-of-the-mill textile factory. Long lines of knitting and weaving machines dominate the hall, while boxes filled with garments and colourful spindles of yarn are piled up in corners. But Özgür Kazova is not like any other factory in Turkey: the four workers perched over their tables, sewing, ironing and supervising the whirring machinery, do not answer to any bosses. Their struggle began in early 2013, when the owners of Kazova Textiles, Ümit and Mustafa Somuncu, put all 95 workers on leave after withholding their pay for several months, blaming poor business conditions. The workers were told they would receive all back-paylater, but upon their return they were informed by the company lawyer that everyone had been dismissed without compensation for “unaccounted absence from work”. “We were dumbstruck,” said Aynur Aydemir who worked at Kazova Textiles for more than eight years. “Up until then we had been working seven days a week, up to 10 hours a day. Business seemed to be thriving. It was hard to believe that the company was really too broke to pay us.” What was more, the owners dismantled all working machinery overnight and disappeared together with more than 100,000 finished jumpers and 40 tonnes of high-quality yarn, leaving the unpaid and now unemployed workers with knitting machines that were almost half a century old and did not work properly. At the end of April, a handful of the former Kazova Textiles employees set up a tent in front of the old factory in order to prevent the owners taking the remaining valuables inside. Undeterred by what they said were threats and intimidation from the owners and the police, their reluctant struggle grew into a full-blown political movement. “At first we were timid, because we had never been involved in any political movement before,” Serkan Gönüs, 42, explained. “We were scared, but little by little our confidence grew when we saw how much support we had from bystanders during those demonstrations.” In the aftermath of Turkey’s protests in the spring of 2013, the workers decided to occupy and reopen the factory. A court ruled that the machines should go to the workers in compensation for their lost wages, and Muzaffer Yigit, 43, who has worked for Kazova Textiles since 1990, set out to repair them. Using the yarn that the old owners had left behind, the first jumpers, branded Diren Kazova (Resist Kazova), were produced. In September, the group hosted its first public fashion show. But discord led to a split, and four workers decided to found the co-operative Free Kazova. “We found that it was not enough to just talk about workers’ rights and resistance in theory,” Gönüs said. “We wanted to come up with a sustainable model for fairer work, and be able to support ourselves.” The Free Kazova workers have reached out to other self-managed factories and co-operatives worldwide in order to share experiences and expertise. Their aim is to produce high-quality, affordable garments for everyone interested in supporting a labour model that presents an alternative to exploitative wage work, with customers being told exactly how the money paid for each jumper is used. “We don’t want to work for a profit, just enough for all of us to get by,” Aynur Aydemir said. “We work six hours a day, and we like coming to work in the morning now, because we are our own bosses.” She added that Özgür Kazova jumpers were now sold not only in Turkey, but in France, Italy and Poland. “It’s actually hard to keep up with demand,” she laughed. “It proves that we are on the right track, and that many people agree with us and what we are defending.” Constanze Letsch"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/24/dubai-desert-green-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-24T16:04:55Z","webTitle":"Is the Dubai desert about to go green?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/24/dubai-desert-green-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/24/dubai-desert-green-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Is the Dubai desert about to go green?","bodyText":"Dubai, the Arab emirate often compared to a teenager because of its youth, breakneck growth and profligate use of resources, is to dramatically change its ways in an attempt to show the world that it can develop into an environmentally mature nation in just a few years. The indoor ski-resort, the manmade islands, the world's tallest building, the chilled sand and Armani hotels are not about to disappear, but the non-stop construction party which has seen the small fishing village on the edge of a stony desert turn into into a super-city of twisted glass towers and giant malls in under 50 years, may finally be over. In place of Dubai's legendary excess and endless boom years comes a sober report from the state of energy on Wednesday, charting the new energy direction which the young city must take if it is to continue flourishing.

Over the next 15 years, the emirate intends to cut its energy and water demand by 30%, retrofit 30,000 buildings to save energy, switch a quarter of the enormous government car fleet to run on compressed gas and keep the temperatures in many buildings at a modest 24C. Power subsidies will be slashed and new incentives offered to instal solar heating and electricity. But that is just the start. As of last week, Dubai could generate just a fraction of the solar power of Britain or Germany despite the fact that it receives a nearly-guaranteed 10 hours of sun a day. That changed on Tuesday when Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai, switched on phase one of a solar power plant 50km out of the city, as part of Dubai's bid to host the 2020 World Expo. It will have a capacity of only 24MW to start with, but in the next 15 years will grow into a monster 1GW plant covering 20 sq km of desert. \"The physical potential of solar energy in Dubai is enormous. It's possible it could provide more than twice Dubai's current electricity consumption\", says Graeme Sims, British regulator of the water and electricity authority. By 2030, says the energy report, Dubai will have cuts its carbon emissions by 29%, switched 30% of its $100bn a year economy to renewable energy, 'clean coal' and nuclear, and initiated a plethora of energy- and water- saving initiatives. It may be too late for the Dubai coastline which has been trashed by strings of housing developments, but the authorities believe they can avoid having to desalinate 8bn gallons of water a year, turn waste into energy, curb pollution and recycle water. Dubai grew up ecologically in 2008 when the recession hit and the property market crashed, says Ivano Iannelli, a former Italian diplomat who directs the Dubai carbon centre of excellence, and helped collate Dubai's green master plan. Then, over just a few weeks, dozens of giant projects were halted and property values bombed. British expats living a luxury lifestyle but fearing prison for their new debts, dumped their Ferarris and 4x4s at the airport with the keys still in them, and as many as 2,500 people a week reportedly fled the boom town. The crash, says Iannelli, gave the Dubai government the chance to rethink its direction. \"Success is no longer recognised in short-term strategies, but the long-term. Now we have a road map for the next 20 years,\" he says. \"Never before did we have the technology to address the challenges of sustainability. The recessions certainly made us think,\" says Saeed Mohamed Al Tayer, chief executive of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. Waleed Salman, a member of the Dubai supreme council of energy, says: \"The ideas have evolved. We have bigger targets. This is organic growth. We learned after the financial crisis to do things better. The new growth will be a new way.\" On the horizon, he says, is the possibility of Dubai becoming the world's first \"smart\" city, where all energy use can be monitored and controlled. \"We have everything in place in term of infrastructure. But we do not jump into the water without knowing how to swim. \"This is just the beginning. Ambition is in our blood. It's what makes our heart beat. People need to be led but a lot of coaching is needed.\" Today, Dubai is booming again with property values soaring and investors flooding in from less stable Arab states as well as Europe. \"They're all welcome. As long as they don't think they can act like energy hooligans,\" said one energy adviser to the emirate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-enterprise-network/2013/may/22/social-enterprise-austria","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-22T06:15:07Z","webTitle":"Young and dynamic: social entrepreneurship in Austria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/may/22/social-enterprise-austria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/may/22/social-enterprise-austria","fields":{"headline":"Young and dynamic: social entrepreneurship in Austria","bodyText":"Social entrepreneurship in Austria is still a young sector – 75% of all initiatives are not older than four years. But they are growing constantly – as is the awareness about what social entrepreneurship is and how social innovation can contribute to societal development. According to a recent study by the Vienna University of Economics and Business, there are around 270 social entrepreneurs to be found in Austria. An infrastructure to support them is slowly emerging, providing co-working spaces, consulting, training or access to networks of supporters. Many individuals do not yet realise that they are in fact social entrepreneurs and that there is a new career pathway unfolding, which receives increasing public acknowledgement. That is why raising awareness about this new type of work and business model, entrepreneurial culture and new career opportunities is still on the forefront of the efforts of organisations such as The Hub Vienna and my own organisation, Ashoka. Both have helped the term \"social entrepreneurship\" become mainstream in Austria. Generating income on their own as well as gaining more financial independence is a major issue for Austrian social entrepreneurs. According to the Vienna university study, more than half (52%) of social entrepreneurs' budget comes from private funding, one-third comes from their own earnings, while roughly 10% come from federal sources. Specific social venture funds do not yet exist in Austria. The financial sector, as well as the social entrepreneurs themselves, still need to capture the opportunities of social financing. One pioneer is Good.Bee, which is providing financing for social enterprises and works in the field of micro-finance in central and eastern Europe. Crowd-funding is also a source for funding: online platforms such as respekt.net help to connect promising projects with investors. Countering the brain-drain The social entrepreneurs in Austria tackle a wide range of different issues. In the field of regional development, Ashoka fellow Martin Hollinetz founded Otelo, which counters the brain drain in rural areas by establishing regional innovation centres, giving people the necessary infrastructure to be innovative and creative and the possibility to start their own enterprises. Inclusion of marginalised groups in mainstream society is a major focus of Austrian social entrepreneurs – Career Moves, for instance, connects people with disabilities with potential employers. Gregor Demblin, the founder, sees huge potential in people with disabilities, as they can be top performers, whose potential is not used due to societal prejudice. Exit, an NGO, helps victims of human trafficking by giving not only legal and psychological advice but also by helping these victims to set up a new life in Austria, and not fall back into prostitution, where they ended up after coming to Austria. A new career path Many young people in Austria do not yet realise that there is a new career path that combines entrepreneurial spirit with solving major social challenges. But several social entrepreneurship support-organisations such as The HUB Vienna, awards such as The Social Impact Award or training programmes like Pioneers of Change in Vienna especially attract young social entrepreneurs. These young aspiring talents have a very unique and fresh approach to deal with a multitude of social problems: whatchado is helping young people to find out what career paths exist and how to get there. They interview people of different backgrounds and sectors and feature them in short films to explain how they became what they are today. Dachgold is convincing companies to use solar energy to cover their energy needs, because they use most of their energy during the day (unlike many private households). Since solar energy storage is very inefficient, using the energy right away during the day is a very sustainable solution. It is not just a lack of knowledge and access which inhibit young social entrepreneurs from starting their own initiative – they are often just afraid to take the risks of founding their own projects. Ashoka fellow Johannes Lindner responded to this by starting Entrepreneurship Education in many Austrian schools and helps students become more entrepreneurial, self-dependent and lose the fear of taking initiative. Johannes's business plan competitions encourage young people to combine their entrepreneurial thinking with self-driven action. Each year, 2,500 students participate in these competitions, and two-thirds of the projects are actually implemented. In Austrian secondary schools, 20,000 students benefit weekly from the teaching and learning content developed by him. Social entrepreneurship in Austria is still too young for us to grasp its scale and impact. Nevertheless, this movement has a lot of potential to bring about social change. One of the main challenges is the lack of support infrastructure outside the urban,densely populated areas. Focus should also be given to initiatives that encourage youth to become more involved and engaged in solving social problems. Competitions for young social entrepreneurs such as the Social Impact Award or the Join our Core competition clearly show that there is lot of potential among Austrian youth. Young people no longer want to adapt to often rigid and uninspired structures in established organisations and companies. Instead, they would prefer to set up their own enterprises where they can live their values, be creative and shape the impact they want to have on society. Without doubt, Austrians will have to take more risks to solve social problems.

But one simple thing can break this dependence. It needs to be cheaper to produce non-carbon energy than it is by digging up coal, gas or oil. Once this happens, most of the coal, gas and oil will automatically be left undisturbed in the ground. To make non-carbon energy become competitive is a major scientific challenge, not unlike the challenge of developing the atom bomb or sending a man to the moon. Science rose to those challenges because a clear goal and timetable were set and enough public money was provided for the research. These programmes had high political profile and public visibility. They attracted many of the best minds of the age. The issue of climate change and energy is even more important and it needs the same treatment. In most countries, there is at present too little public spending on non-carbon energy research. Instead, we need a major international research effort, with a clear goal and a clear timetable. What should it focus on? There will always be many sources of non-carbon energy – nuclear fission, hydropower, geothermal, wind, nuclear fusion (possibly) and solar. But nuclear fission and hydropower have been around for many years. Nuclear is essential but faces political obstacles and there are physical limits to hydropower. Nuclear fusion remains uncertain. And, while wind can play a big role in the UK, in many countries its application is limited. So there is no hope of completely replacing fossil fuel without a major contribution from the power of the sun. Moreover, the sun sends energy to the Earth equal to about 5,000 times our total energy needs. It is inconceivable that we cannot collect enough of this energy for our needs, at a reasonable cost. The price of photovoltaic energy is falling at 10% a year, and in Germany a serious amount of unsubsidised, solar electricity is already being added to the grid. In California, forward contracts for solar energy are becoming competitive with other fuels and they will become more so, as technology progresses. But time is desperately short and there are two even bigger scientific challenges. The first is to make solar power available on a 24-hour basis, when the sun shines only part of the day and can be obscured by cloud. This requires a major breakthrough in the storage of electricity. The second is to reduce the cost of transmitting electricity from areas of high luminosity and low land value to the major population centres of the world. Better storage requires major breakthroughs in the science of batteries; better transmission requires new materials that are much better at conducting electricity without loss of power. In all these cases, the solution requires new disruptive technologies. So here is our proposal. There should be a world sunpower programme of research, development and demonstration. The goal would be by 2025 to deliver solar electricity at scale to the grid at a cost below the cost of fossil fuel. All countries would be invited to participate. Those who did would commit, in their own countries, to major new programmes of research, internationally co-ordinated, and to share their findings for the benefit of the world. Each country would have the goal of demonstrating bulk supply of unsubsidised solar electricity in scale to the grid by 2025. At the world level, the target would be for solar electricity to be at least 10% of total energy supply by 2025 and 25% by 2030. Countries' contributions to this target would be closely watched. The programme would be truly broad. It would cover non-grid solar as well as grid electricity. And it would be of value to wind electricity as well, through improving storage and transmission. Unlike fossil fuel, solar produces no pollution and no miners get killed. Unlike nuclear fission, it produces no radioactive waste. It harnesses the power of the sun, which is the ultimate source of most energy on Earth. And it can strike the imagination of a people and therefore of their politicians. A central role of governments is to promote new public knowledge. Surely the most important knowledge of all is how to preserve human life as we know it. In 2015, the nations of the world will meet to agree their commitments on climate change. Whatever else they agree, they should go for a major sunpower programme.

Over the last decade, rising oil prices have been driven primarily by rising production costs. After the release of the IEA's World Energy Outlook last November, Deutsche Bank's former head of energy research Mark Lewis noted that massive levels of investment have corresponded to an ever declining rate of oil supply increase: \"Over the past decade, the oil and gas industry's upstream investments have registered an astronomical increase, but these ever higher levels of capital expenditure have yielded ever smaller increases in the global oil supply. Even these have only been made possible by record high oil prices. This should be a reality check for those now hyping a new age of global oil abundance.\" Since 2000, the oil industry's investments have risen by 180% - a threefold increase - but this has translated into a global oil supply increase of just 14%. Two-thirds of this increase has been made-up by unconventional oil and gas. In other words, the primary driver of the cost explosion is the shift to expensive and difficult-to-extract unconventionals due to the peak and plateau in conventional oil production since 2005. The increasingly dislocated economics of oil production According to Lewis, who now heads up energy transition and climate change research at leading investment firm Kepler Cheuvreux: \"The most straightforward interpretation of this data is that the economics of oil have become completely dislocated from historic norms since 2000 (and especially since 2005), with the industry investing at exponentially higher rates for increasingly small incremental yields of energy.\" The IEA's new World Energy Investment Outlook published last week revised the agency's estimates of future oil industry capital expenditures out to 2035 even higher, from $9.4 trillion to $11.3 trillion – an increase of 20%. Oil prices could in turn increase by $15 per barrel in 2025 if investment does not pick up. Most of the investment increase required would be devoted not to new sources of production, but \"to replace lost production from depleting fields,\" said Lewis. In the IEA's own words: \"More than 80% of this spending [of between $700 and $850 billion annually by the 2030s] is required just to keep production at today's levels, that is, to compensate for the effects of decline at existing fields. The figure is higher in the case of oil (at close to 90% of total capital expenditure).\" But as Lewis pointed out, the \"risk of insufficient investment\" is not a hypothetical matter that might occur a decade from now, but is \"already today a clear and present danger\" as most of the oil and gas majors have revised down their plans for capital expenditure in recent months. Stranded by post-peak oil price hikes There is therefore \"a medium to longer-term threat\" to the oil industry's \"business model from high and rising oil prices.\" We just don't get the same quality of energy from shale oil and gas as cheap crude - and what we do get comes at a higher cost. Although oil prices are at record-high levels, production costs are rising so dramatically that they are fatally undermining oil company profits, forcing them to announce cut backs in expenditures this year. ExxonMobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell \"are now signalling that they expect their capital expenditure (capex) to level off in the next few years,\" reported the Financial Times. \"And they are likely to come under continued pressure to bring it down.\" Mark Lewis thus concludes that \"the upstream oil industry is already struggling to make the returns that shareholders require for the kind of upstream risks that are now being taken.\" Profits are being squeezed, and they'll only get slimmer with time. Other factors likely to push oil prices higher over coming decades include the increasing reliance on shale gas \"to fill the supply gap… in the face of stalling crude-oil production since 2005,\" which has \"significantly lower energy density than crude oil\"; \"declining exports of crude oil globally since 2005 as OPEC consumes more and more of its own production\"; and \"the ever-present but recently heightened geopolitical risks in key oil-producing regions.\" Lewis' verdict for the future of the global oil industry is devastating. In Kepler Cheuvreux's April report 'Stranded Assets, Fossilized Revenues', Lewis argued that a pending global climate treaty would seriously endanger the profitability of fossil fuel majors due to emissions restrictions enforcing 'stranded assets' (unexploited fossil fuel reserves that, having become obsolete, are recorded as a loss of profit). Far from simply facing this risk due to a potential climate treaty, Lewis said, this risk arises even due to rising oil prices alone - prices driven primarily by the end of the age of easy crude. The bubble is starting to burst According to oil company director Bill Powers of Arsenal Energy Inc. based in Calgary, Canada, the demise of the fossil fuel industry is already in motion and will pave the way for the inexorable rise of renewable energy. In a presentation at the IEA in April, Powers told agency staffers that: \"Renewables, especially rooftop solar, will take a leading role in a distributed power revolution now underway. The utility industry is vigorously fighting distributed power's advancement.\" The US shale gas bonanza was largely enabled by bubble economics – \"low interest rates and easy financings\" – but is unravelling as financial wishful thinking hits the wall of production reality, and is already a \"commercial failure,\" Powers told the IEA. Almost \"every player\" has experienced \"huge debts on balance sheets\" and \"enormous write-downs of shale gas reserves.\" In 2012 alone, he said, Southwest Energy wrote down reserves of Fayetteville from 5 to 3 trillion cubic feet (tcf); Chesapeake Energy wrote down Haynesville and Barnett proven reserves by 4.6 tcf (erasing 20% of its proven reserves); EnCana wrote off $1.7 billion in shale gas assets; British Petroleum wrote off $2.1 billion due to failed investments in Fayetteville and Woodford shales; and BHP Billiton wrote off $2.84 billion in shale assets – to name just a few. Since the beginning of the shale boom, total asset write-downs by the largest shale players are approaching $35 billion, reports the Oil and Gas Journal. Powers, whose book Cold, Hungry and in the Dark: Exploding the Natural Gas Supply Myth anticipated many of the challenges being experienced by the industry, warns of an imminent 1970s style \"natural gas deliverability crisis,\" which through the course of the next decade will \"destroy consumer confidence and shake the American economy to its foundation.\" The crisis will follow a decline in the Marcellus shale which, although originally claimed to contain 410 tcf of gas reserves, in fact likely has just 50 tcf of technically recoverable reserves. Powers forecasts that Marcellus will peak before the end of 2015, pointing out that Chesapeake Energy, the largest landowner and producer in the Marcellus has already \"dropped most of its rigs and is running down its inventory of wells.\" Are 60% of US shale 'recoverable' reserves commercially unviable? Such reservations are increasingly recognised by industry experts. In a new paper for the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Ivan Sandrea - a senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young London for global oil and gas in emerging markets - points to an analysis of 35 independent shale gas and tight oil focused companies \"active across the major US plays and accounting for 3 million barrels of oil per day per of production,\" showing that in the last six years \"their financial performance has steadily worsened\" despite production growth. In the new age of expensive, difficult-to-extract unconventionals, investment expenditures in production costs nearly match total revenues every year, and \"net cash flow is becoming negative while debt keeps rising.\" Sandrea also blames the \"close link between rising debt and production, the rising cost of debt to total revenues and negative cash flow, which add to concerns about the sustainability of the business.\" The cash flow per share of US independents investing in shale oil and gas \"is negative\" and \"trending more negative with time.\" Although he alludes to some vague optimism in the industry that these trends will reverse in a few years when shale explorations are more \"fully understood and financially evaluated,\" there seems little evidence from the economic and production fundamentals that this is likely. In North Dakota's Bakken, for instance, Sandrea observes that despite robust production growth, \"the average production rate per well is not increasing as before and the amount of new wells it takes to obtain a similar increase in overall production is rising.\" Overall, he describes the shale oil and gas business as \"analogous to an equation that operators have yet to solve.\" Based on \"an holistic review of the consensus and experience to date, the equation may still not be workable for a few more years, if at all.\" His sobering conclusion is that only about 40% of purportedly recoverable US shale oil and gas reserves may be commercially viable: \"… who can, or will want to, fund the drilling of millions of acres and hundreds of thousands of wells at an ongoing loss? ... The benevolence of the US capital markets cannot last forever for all players… A more realistic outcome is that sections of the industry will have to restructure and focus more rapidly on the most commercially sustainable areas of the plays, perhaps about 40% of the current acreage and resource estimates, possibly yielding a lower production growth in the US than is currently expected.\" The king is dead. Long live the peasants. Mark Lewis sees the increasingly unsustainable fossil fuel business model as being potentially wiped out over the next two decades by the renewable energy industry, which in contrast \"has achieved tremendous cost reductions in recent years.\" As oil costs and prices creep upwards due to \"rising demand under increasingly constrained supply conditions… the greater the incentive will be to accelerate the deployment of renewable-energy technologies and to achieve greater energy-efficiency savings.\" Under a business as usual scenario, Lewis warns of a \"real risk to the oil industry from rising prices\" which when \"combined with continuing reductions in the costs of renewable technologies... could drive the accelerated substitution of oil in the global energy mix over the next two decades: \"In turn, this would risk creating stranded assets over the medium to longer term both for the oil industry itself and – owing to the central role of oil in energy pricing more generally – for the global fossil-fuel industry as a whole.\" Powers agrees. \"The biggest solutions to the coming deliverability crisis will be residential solar, energy storage and improved grid management,\" he said. But the \"incumbent utilities will fight very aggressively.\" In this context, throwing more money at the dying industry of yesteryear is clearly not the answer - no matter how much they disingenuously clamour for it. Cold, hard economic reality is staring us in the face: we need to ramp-up investments in the clean, decentralised technologies of tomorrow.

There are now over 450,000 solar installations, almost all on household roofs, which together have a capacity of 2.7GW. On a sunny day solar power is able to generate around 2% of UK demand over a 24-hour period. But because solar panels generate electricity in peak daylight hours, this is the equivalent of around 6% of all electricity needed in Britain between 10am and 5pm. According to calculations by the Solar Trade Association, record amounts of electricity will have been generated in the recent heatwave, with solar overtaking wind power for the first time. In the past year, more than 100,000 households installed solar despite the so-called feed in tariff subsidy being slashed by the government. \"The UK generated around 16,000MWh on Tuesday compared to 9,900MWh of wind. The total consumption of electricity on this relatively calm day was 766,987MWh,\" said Ray Noble, PV specialist at the Solar Trade Association. \"These few sunny weeks have shown that the solar resource in Britain is phenomenal,\" said Leonie Greene, communications director of the association. \"We now have a very large number of domestic installations and around one-third of the solar electricity generated now comes from utility-sized solar fields. But there are still very few medium-sized commercial or industrial installations. If the government backed these they would see enormous payback.\" The Met Office said it was too early to say whether British sunshine records will be broken in July. But they released figures showing that England and Wales received over 75% of the long-term monthly average for July in the first two weeks of the month. Wales received more hours of sunshine both in June and in the first two weeks of July than any other region in Britain. The blazing summer has resulted in more solar records falling across Europe. In Germany, which has more solar capacity than any other country in the world, the 1.3m installations generated nearly 40% of the country's daytime electricity demand on 7 July.\" \"Germany is now light years ahead of the UK and benefitting. Within a decade, many German towns and cities could be substantially 'off-grid' [or self sufficient] and will be taking the grid system out of the hands of the private energy companies,\" said Alan Simpson, former Labour MP and now independent adviser on renewable energy after a fact-finding tour of German renewable industries. \"Whereas in Britain, nearly all installations face south to capture peak sunshine, in Germany the problem now is to avoid massive peaks in the middle of the day. They now need to come up with west-facing panels to spread the electricity generated across the day\". According to Simpson, solar power in Germany may have \"grid parity\" by 2017. \"That is the point when solar will be generating electricity at wholesale prices.\" \"Solar power can now be generated for 10 eurocents per kilowatt-hour. That is a very good price,\" said Bernhard Beck, chief executive of German solar power plant builder Belectric. \"We are approaching the costs of generation from new conventional power stations\". • This article was amended on 26th July 2013.

Designed in partnership with Stephen Lamb, founder of South Africa based green design firm Touching the Earth Lightly, the Solar Revolution Pavilion is a 200 sq metre, 6-metre high structure built of 1,600 plastic vegetable crates containing reused plastic bottles.. The crates will eventually become eco-friendly bricks for a school library's walls.. The environmentalist David de Rothschild who journeyed across the Pacific on a boat made from plastic bottles in 2010, said at the building's unveiling in Manila's Luneta Park: \"This is a living example of how you can take food, shelter, water and energy using existing resources that people often disregard as wasteful and actually turn them into something that is useful, and beneficial and can create a quality of life.\" The Filipino social entrepreneur Ilac Diaz who helped open the building and whose My Shelter Foundation's \"Liter of Light\" project has transformed plastic bottles into sunlight-powered bulbs for 120,000 homes of the 20 million Filipinos still living without electricity, said the pavilion will also see the launch of a new solar night light. Made by adding LED lights and batteries to the bottles, these lights will be distributed to 150 locations around the country. Visitors to the building will also be able to learn about other locally available green technologies, such as hydroponics, which involves growing plants without soil. Diaz said: \"The point is to teach people how to do it. The world has been too much about expensive technologies that are imported and brought in off-the-shelf.

Let’s take stock of Monday with a parting summary that’s wider than today, in the spirit of where are we at the campaign midpoint? The Coalition is clearly having trouble landing the core “jobs and growth” message. The budget message has been wound back progressively to focus on the tax cut as a small business measure, not a tax cut for big companies. Economists have also picked apart the benefits of the policy to the point where it must now be clear to anyone paying attention that the budget roadmap is a distance short of a magic bullet. Malcolm Turnbull is also starting to go to work on his negatives. A new advertisement featuring the prime minister talking about his upbringing and his father (the personal being political) is clearly designed to create a connection between the voters and the candidate, which suggests there may be trouble on that front. Given how presidential the Coalition campaign is, given all the Coalition eggs are in the Turnbull basket, it is a problem, potentially, if the voters are feeling disconnected from the candidate. The Coalition can’t exactly revert to a team campaign from here, this play has got to work, or they all sink. Labor is just chugging along with its game plan, which has been to contrast its social capital and inclusive growth agenda with the Coalition’s trickle down proposal. It’s been steady-as-she-goes, there’s been no significant repositioning, or recalibration of the messaging, and the polls (as well as some of the factors I’ve outlined above) suggest we have a genuine contest. Bill Shorten looks relaxed, and his communication is mostly effective. But things are going to get tougher from here. Labor remains weak on costings and spending, and I think it’s risky to launch big spending initiatives without a very clear sense of the specific savings that will pay for the policies. Small tells like a childcare policy that isn’t means tested suggests there’s not enough internal discipline, that election spending imperatives are crowding out the budget imperatives. And how about jobs and the economy? This territory does need to be occupied at some point. But, we are only at the half way point. All things liable to change without notice. Thanks for your company today, I’ll be back, doing it all again, tomorrow. GetUp! has referred the LNP backbencher George Christensen to the Australian Electoral Commission for seeking to give Libby Barge of Eco Barge Turtle Sanctuary $12,000 “personal contribution” if he’s re-elected. The activist group says in a press release issued this afternoon that Christensen, in a Facebook post, says he will provide a “$12,000 personal contribution” to Libby Barge of Eco Barge Turtle Sanctuary – but only if he is re-elected. GetUp! national director Paul Oosting contends this sort of proposition is “against the laws and conventions of our democracy. He’s got serious questions to answer”. Look out Sturt. The shadow education minister, Kate Ellis, is being pressed on Sky News about how Labor will fund its childcare policy. Kate Ellis: The way we fund it is to make it a priority and find savings elsewhere. Ellis says Labor will save more than it spends over the cycle. Is this over four years or over 10 years, Sky political editor David Speers, wonders? Ellis says the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, will make the announcements at the appropriate time. Speers asks Ellis whether it is OK for Bill Shorten to characterise childcare as a responsibility that falls on women. Ellis says the Labor leader is just talking about reality. The evidence is clear, she says, that women do the majority of unpaid work in this country. But what if Tony Abbott had said that, would Labor be sanguine? Ellis says Shorten is not saying that it’s right or the way it should be, just that it’s the current reality. A better childcare system would make it less of a reality, she says. Gracious. Sorry. Thread, calls, people coming and going, will pick up the threads now. I do love the idea of the two campaign planes snarling at each other on the tarmac. Malcolm Turnbull was due to go to Tasmania this afternoon, but the bad weather has apparently scotched that. It was quite funny though, how Malcolm Turnbull corrected himself when he thought he’d gone in too deep on fathers. Mothers, great. Engineers, great, kiddies, great, everyone – great. If you don’t do that, you wake up lathered in a fresh moral panic about some key demographic disdained – like all the faux outrage today about Bill Shorten being a Jurassic creature who thinks only women are responsible for childcare (despite the fact he’s produced a policy which is clearly intended to help women work more). God, campaigns, excruciating. Malcolm Turnbull’s self-identification as a feminist this afternoon gives me the organising idea to work through what I need to work through with the prime minister’s statement about his father in the press conference just then: let’s grab the catchcry of second-wave feminists, the personal is political. Let’s do this step by step. Overnight (as has been referenced several times today), the Coalition campaign has produced an advertisement which features Malcolm Turnbull talking about his father. The purpose of this conversation with voters is obvious. The campaign needs to counter perceptions about the candidate being removed from the life experience of ordinary Australian voters. What better way to counter that perception than with a testimonial about your lived experience, and by producing a lived experience common to a lot of people who have been through the visceral trauma of parental separation. Anyone who has lived through a similar experience immediately understands what Turnbull is talking about, empathy with that case study is immediate – it cuts across gender, social class and economic circumstances. Even if you haven’t been through that, there’s an element of “there but for the grace of God go I”. Personal stories are powerful, that’s why modern politicians trade in them. So let’s come now to where the campaign objective (humanising Malcolm) meets the personal. Malcolm Turnbull can deliver this version of himself because it’s real. The loss he still carries floats to the surface entirely organically. This is a foundational story for this man, who also happens to be a politician and, currently, the prime minister. He dives deep into the story to tell it – you saw it just then. It’s not a campaign conceit, it’s core to his personal mythology. That’s why it has currency, it’s a kernel of real in an ocean of tactics and strategy. It’s a bit like where I started this morning. I mentioned there’s an overlay of nostalgia in Turnbull’s framing and styling: he needs that sense of continuity to take the edge off his aggressive modernity, lest he get typecast as the tech guy, or the venture capital guy, or the let markets rip guy – he’s creating something more timeless in the way he’s presenting himself. It’s also part of the Coalition’s stability pitch, the “let’s reduce the chaos and turnover in Canberra” pitch, being the person who projects to voters as calm, and prime ministerial. The affect is deliberate. It’s not an accident. It boils down to a simple proposition. Election campaigns for candidates are a process of reducing your negatives. The higher the negatives get, the harder it is for you to be elected. If you have a negative (and Turnbull’s negatives are pretty obvious), best get about reducing them. Quite fascinating in it’s way, this. All the turning on the head of a pin, and the pulses of human emotion in the middle of the choreography. Well we are having an interesting day, bit strange, but interesting, I’ll be back with some thoughts on that shortly. Q: I asked before about the Sky News people’s forum with the ‘Courier-Mail’. Will you go to that on Wednesday and Mr Shorten said that it would be offensive to Queenslanders if you don’t? Malcolm Turnbull: I’m sure he did. Look, we are actually - we are having some -we are looking at some alternatives and what I’m hoping to do is to have a debate that is a bit different, that is - that involves Facebook and that involves a larger audience, and that is more engaging. So, I can assure you, I enjoy debating and I want to reach as many people as I possibly can in the debate because we have a great story to tell. Our national economic plan is vitally important for our nation’s future, and I want to have the opportunity to explain it and take questions on it for as many people as possible. So we’re looking at some so we are looking at how we can achieve wider and greater reach for the debate. If that’s all, thank you very much for being here. As I said, fathers rock, mothers are great, engineers are great, girls can do anything. See you. Q: Mr Turnbull, could I just ask you about the video your campaign released last night, your reflections on your relationship with your father and your upbringing. Why was it important to release that? Was that to counter misconceptions? Malcolm Turnbull: It’s important to honour your parents Mark. It is important to honour your father. I was - I was brought up by my father. He ... He taught me so many things, some of them I talked about in that video. He taught me how to cook, not with great talent, I hasten to add, but competently. He taught me how to iron competently. I’ve been given high marks by Mrs Turnbull on that score. And he taught me respect and loyalty. Well, as I said, I would not be the man I am today without him. He was a great – you know, the most – there are many remarkable things about my dad, but I tell you one thing that was in some ways the most remarkable. When my mother left us, we had nowhere to live and Dad rented a flat and didn’t have any furniture. I think the only bit of furniture we had left was my bed, so it wasn’t – he had every reason to be a bit unhappy, to say the least. And yet he never ever said a bad word about her. You think about, you know – you think about how rare that is. He never uttered a critical word of my mother in all of those years. And when he died and then – he was killed young, he was killed in an aeroplane crash when he was 56 ... I had both of their sets of correspondence and I could read the letters that Bruce wrote to my mother, the letters this he were filled with sadness and reproach and, you know, how could you do this, why did you do that, and the back and forth. I literally have the two sides of the correspondence. And I thought: “What does it say about a man? What does it say about his love that he could sit down and write letters like that, pouring out his heart and then turn to his little boy and say, your mother is the greatest woman in the world and she loves you more than anything.” What a man. What a great man. So, fathers, fathers rock. There you go. Fathers rock. And so do the mothers, too. Are there any other questions? A reporter notes the prime minister flagged changes to the Fair Work Act over the weekend. What exactly would they be? (I gave you that quote a couple from Turnbull a couple of posts back). Malcolm Turnbull: Well, as you know, under the Fair Work Act there are a number of - there is a list of what are called objectionable clauses in EBAs, in industrial agreements, and what we would do - what we propose to do is to include into that list of objectionable clauses ones which would have the impact ... have an adverse impact on volunteer organisations such as the CFA. Turnbull goes on to reference the floods over the weekend: Bill Shorten has to decide whether he is on the side of the heroes of the emergency services brigades or whether he’s on the side of the trade unions. They aren’t heroes in this calculation. A question about union governance, which gives the prime minister an opportunity to reference the Country Fire Authority dispute in Victoria. And infernos. Malcolm Turnbull: You’ve seen the extraordinary events here in Victoria where you would have the 60,000 volunteers of the CFA – these are the men and women who stand between Victorians and the inferno of the Australian bushfire. Those heroes, those volunteers, those community organisations are, if the government has its way, if the premier has his way, are going to be subordinated to the firefighters union, at the union’s demand. Q: Your family has been a big focus of the campaign the last couple of days. Do you want Australians to get to know you better and why, and would you say this is now the real Malcolm campaigning? Malcolm Turnbull: I will leave you to the commentary. Several questions about childcare. Will the government bring forward its package? Malcolm Turnbull: If we can secure the passage of our legislation after parliament gets back, assuming we are returned to government, then, and if we can start it earlier, then we will ... We have a genuine reform package, it’s a genuine reform package, and it is one that will provide the greatest support, considerably enhanced support to families on lower incomes. Q: Do you have any alternative savings for childcare, if the Senate does block these measures in the next parliament? Malcolm Turnbull: Well, it is a package, as you know, we have savings out of the – we have other savings, as you know, in the social welfare budget. We believe they are prudent savings. Look, the reality is Labor is proposing to spend $3bn extra and they have not indicated at all where it is going to come from. A question on why people like independents in the Newspoll (Answer: vote 1 Coalition, written and authorised by Tony Nutt, Liberal party Canberra); then will he apologise to Vietnam veterans like Bill Shorten did for failing to attend the repatriation ceremony? (No, he won’t, he doesn’t want to politicise the issue by any further comment.) Perhaps there will be a run on avowed feminism now in Coalition ranks? Never been a more exciting time. Malcolm Turnbull switches modes to the exciting times before us this morning. I want to say, as I said this morning with Kelly O’Dwyer and I said again with Kelly and Karen Andrews, girls can do anything. In particular they can do engineering. You have seen so many impressive, talented women who are engineers. Q: A lot of people spend time talking about female empowerment, would you describe yourself as a feminist? Malcolm Turnbull: I would describe myself as a feminist. As I often say, women hold up half the sky. The prime minister opens his daily press conference by expressing sorrow at the deaths that have been recorded as a consequence of the wild weather over the weekend, on behalf of the government, and on Bill Shorten’s behalf. Turnbull thanks the emergency workers “risking their lives to keep Australians safe”. He also urges people around the country to stay away from rising flood waters. We’ve covered this separately today on Guardian Australia but in the event you missed it, the Greens want to regulate the electricity system to ensure a “fair price” is paid for solar-generated electricity and ensure a “legal right” to connect to the grid by forcing energy companies to prove they cannot connect a consumer. The Greens’ clean energy policy, which has been released today, would put $192m for solar into schools, establish a solar ombudsman who would enforce a “right to solar” for renters and force energy companies to write-down pole and wire assets. The Greens would also put $5m into an information campaign to promote the Clean Energy Finance Corporation’s (CEFC) schemes to support households and businesses installing solar with no upfront costs. We should have a Turnbull press conference coming up soonish. I’m a distance from fully across this issue, but a dispute rumbling away in Victoria about the Country Fire Authority crossed over into the federal campaign over this past weekend. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is under pressure about an enterprise agreement covering the Country Fire Authority being pursued by the United Firefighters’ Union. Today the Country Fire Authority’s board has issued a statement saying is has serious concerns about the agreement. We have serious concerns many of these proposed clauses are unlawful and we have legal advice that indicates CFA would be in breach of its statutory obligations. We are now seeking senior counsel advice on this issue. While the Fair Work Commission’s recommendation stated the changes to the agreement do not impact on volunteers, the recommendation does not override the many specific clauses within the agreement that give rise to those issues. Many of these clauses have no place in modern day workplaces and are out of step with today’s society. Over the weekend, Malcolm Turnbull went to a CFA rally and said: “If we’re re-elected, we’ll rectify it ... There would be changes to the Fair Work Act that would relate to what would be objectionable or unacceptable clauses in EBAs.” The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, was asked about the dispute earlier today. Q: The CFA say they are not being listened to. Why weren’t you at the rally? Bill Shorten: First of all, I have the highest regard for the volunteer firefighters and professional firefighters. The issue about working through the EBA or industrial relations frame work for the CFA professional firefighters is a state issue. Of course we expect, I would hope premier Andrews consults the volunteer firefighters just as they’ve been working with the professional firefighters. But it is a state issue. Much like the industrial arrangements are for police and for other matters, I would expect the state government to bring the parties together. Mr Turnbull said he is going to fix it by changing the Fair Work Act. He needs to explain how he will do this. It is really the fact he is causing more trouble where there’s already enough trouble existing at the moment. All the robos. Bring me all the robos. The prime minister, meanwhile, is calling for robo gals in Melbourne. Yes, he is. (He’s in an event with startup folks.) He clearly thinks better of robo gal. He’s happy to see robo guys too. Now I have a text copy of Bill Shorten’s speech to the RSL. Here’s a excerpt that will give you the flavour. Bill Shorten: Beyond the fallen, hundreds of thousands Australians would return home wounded, or bearing the invisible scars of trauma. And all who served, all who returned, were changed in some way by what they had seen, and what they had endured. For that generation – and for every generation who followed in their footsteps - things could not be the same. And so often they could not find the words to explain why. So often they could not answer the question: what did you do in the war? From this reality, in this silence, the RSL grew. A welcoming place of camaraderie and quiet understanding. A heart and a home in the community for Australians seeking the uncomplicated solidarity of those who knew what it was like. From its very first days, the RSL fulfilled this mission – a mission that no government had turned its mind too. You reached beyond rehabilitation, you looked further than commemoration. You offer at your core instead the comfort of stability, normality, respect and community. And even as the organisation has grown and diversified and broadened its mission and its ambition: to charity, to sport, to social welfare and aged care, that fundamental respect has continued, that unchanging devotion has endured. A century ago, in the aftermath of a war that cost our young nation so many young lives – Australia made a promise to remember. Country towns planted seeds which grew into avenues of honour. Coastal villages quarried white stone for monuments covered in a roll-call where surnames came in twos and threes, sons and brothers who fell, faces to the foe, sometimes on the same day and on the same ground. That tradition of remembering has flourished and endured. In a time when so many of the old certainties and old loyalties have faded in our society, the Anzac legend has only grown in resonance and meaning. And it should be a source of tremendous pride – to all veterans and their families – that today those commemorations are overwhelmingly led and supported by our young people. Young Australians, here and abroad. Gazing up at the steep cliffs of Anzac Cove, shoulder to shoulder in the morning light at Villers-Brettoneux. Retracing the Kokoda track and waiting for dawn at Hellfire Pass. A resurgence of Australian pride: from Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, North Africa and the Mediterranean. Treading lightly on the ground made hallow by those who died for their country. Gathering - at the going down of the sun and in the morning - to say ‘Lest we forget’. But those words, our oldest national promise, have to mean something for those who came home, as well as those who did not. And the uncomfortable truth is that as a nation we have been better at honouring the memory of our dead, than offering decent support for the living. From soldier-settlement schemes that sentenced too many families to an incredibly arduous task on unyielding land, to the shameful treatment dealt to those who returned from Vietnam to a country divided. We have not always fulfilled the duty we owe, to those who have done theirs. For all the memorials that enrich our landscape, there are no walls covered in poppies for veterans who would later take their own lives. Yet their loss is no less, the sadness of their passing no smaller. LDP Senator David Leyonhjelm, again facing the existential horrors of relevance deprivation, wonders how to be outrageous. Hmm, I know, let’s apologise to the much maligned taxpayers of Australia borrowing liberally (excuse the pun) from Kevin Rudd’s apology to Indigenous people. That will do it, surely. Feeling all the feelings. What do the kids say in Harry Potter? Mischief managed? Ok let’s pause for a moment to gather the sum of Monday’s parts. (Look at these two: my people, ah yes, my people. Hello there.) The campaign morning is fairly straightforward thus far. Labor is pressing ahead with childcare as a theme, adding $100m today to $3bn promised yesterday to make the system more favourable for working families. Bill Shorten has attempted to fend off claims that his policy is a fantasy because he doesn’t have the money to pay for it – but the Labor leader is also making it clear we are going to have to wait for the final costings to know whether the various columns add up. The final costings will come when Labor has finished outlining its election policies, he said today. The Coalition is attempting to maintaining pressure on the profligacy front with a release of a mid-campaign stocktake and some fighting words from the treasurer, Scott Morrison, about Labor’s war on everything (which is fortunately less ferocious than Labor’s war on everything last week, which had bullets and toxins and, possibly, the joint strike fighter.) My favourite page of the compendium of Labor horrors is the Labor/Greens minority government page, which is splattered with green paint. Malcolm Turnbull has called by Kelly O’Dwyer’s electorate with a small funding announcement for sport before attending (with Shorten) an RSL conference where both leaders pledged to do more for veterans. This afternoon the prime minister will be deeply excited with another bunch of start-up folks. Never a more exciting time. Onwards, upwards. Labor’s campaign spokeswoman, Penny Wong, is out with reporters in Canberra trying to rebut the Coalition’s attack on Labor’s costings on the childcare package. She says after three years, “the best they can do at this point in the campaign is to simply have an angry, shouty treasurer having a go at the Labor party. Well, that’s not really a second-term agenda.” Penny Wong: On costings, Labor has made very clear we will save more than we spend over the decade and, just as we were prepared to be upfront with the Australian people prior to the election being called about savings, you can anticipate more savings announcements from the Labor party before the election. Q: Do you think childcare is mainly women’s business? Penny Wong: I think childcare is parents’ business and if you’re referencing what Bill said I would say this: we know in Australia the disproportionate burden of caring work does fall on women and that’s why we’ve put forward a policy to support women making different choices, to support women making the choice to return to work, to make it easier for working families to juggle work and family. That’s the whole point of Labor’s package. Q: Fiona Nash has labelled those comments as prehistoric. Do you think that it’s prehistoric? Penny Wong: Has she talked to Barnaby Joyce lately? That’s my only answer to that. (If this was an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race, I’d say the Wong Library is open for business. It isn’t an episode of RuPaul, however, it’s an election. So I’ll move on calmly.) Back briefly to Scott Steel, and the spinoff conversations from this week’s polling podcast, and Scott’s idea that we should be looking at conservative Catholics as a subset of tactical voters. I asked why. This was his response. Micro, but quite fascinating. I might see if Mark Textor’s got a view. My technical nonsense also prevented a clean report of the prime minister and the employment initiative with veterans. Malcolm Turnbull said he would work with groups like SoldierOn and with business leaders (“captains of industry” was the Turnbull formulation) to “encourage employers to recognise the leadership and skills veterans hold” and “honour their service to the nation.” Malcolm Turnbull: We believe Australian employers should be more aware of the important leadership skills veterans have and the value that they offer to their organisations. Improving, promoting the employment of veterans is a key agenda for us in our next term of government. Bill Shorten opens his contribution by saying that is it fitting that there is no difference between the major parties on defence matters. He also repeats the apology he gave last week for not going to the Vietnam repatriation ceremony. This was the wrong decision. Just an aside. The speech writers have clearly poured an enormous amount of effort into both of these contributions. They are both very fine indeed. Because of technical difficulties I haven’t got chunks of Shorten, I just didn’t get the quotes down, but I will come back and share some of the more elegantly crafted sections when I get a text copy of the speech. Shorten ends his contribution, like Turnbull, noting that more has to be done to help veterans of current conflicts. We must do better, we must do more, Shorten said, adding veterans are owed more than the respect of history. Sorry I’m having the odd technical glitch but I will resist the urge to throw the computer out the window and power on. The Labor leader Bill Shorten is speaking now. Given this is a centenary event, Malcolm Turnbull speaks about world war one and his family connections to conflict. He then points forward to the present, the current issues facing veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder Malcolm Turnbull: From afar, this tapestry tells our national story. Up close, each thread tells its own tale of courage, grief and sorrow. Australia in 1916 was a vastly different place. There were few welfare services and the elderly, the sick and the unemployed were largely left to fend for themselves. Veterans struggled to get help for their injuries and to return to civilian life. And the hidden wounds, the psychological damage that remained unseen, and therefore untreated, affected both them and their families, sometimes for generations. Even today, we are still learning how best to help those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. So these were the conditions our first veterans faced after serving their country. Into that breach came the RSL – the spirit of comradeship, spread out across the nation into thousands of suburbs, streets and homes touched by war. The league committed itself to provide for the sick, wounded and needed among those who’d served among those who’d served and their dependants, including pensions, medical attention and employment. It was instrumental in the creation of the medical repatriation system and the introduction of service, disability and war widows pensions. In more recent years, the RSL has also helped us to better focus on commemorative activities, including the Anzac centenary. After pausing at last week’s repatriation ceremony for Vietnam veterans, which became a campaign controversy, (including a hat tip to Tony Abbott, who set in motion the repatriation exercise) he’s now deep into veterans and their challenges. Turnbull says he will have more to say shortly about early intervention strategies to treat mental illness, including greater support for Australia’s growing female veteran community. We also acknowledge the very serious issue of homelessness among veterans, which is illustrated in the Queensland RSL’s recent report, a place to call home. The causes of homelessness are complex but recognised risk factors include mental illness such as PTSD. I’ve asked Dan [Tehan] to gather state and territory ministers to ensure that addressing homelessness among veterans is a priority in the next term of government. The commonwealth will also require its agencies to identify whether clients are veterans to help us understand the extent of the problem. He also references an initiative involving employers. The Returned Services League has always sought to unite Australians and their leaders in respecting and supporting our veterans. You remind us that our freedoms have been bought at a great price, that our national interests must be effectively guarded and that, in the words of your wise motto, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. This is Malcolm Turnbull at the RSL, who then proceeds to outline the Coalition’s defence spending, before touching down at Thucydides, a favourite preoccupation of the prime minister. He quotes the Athenian general: “You know as well as we do that justice as the world goes is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer as they must.” Turnbull then goes deep Churchill, resonant, sonorous, a rhetorical chord progression. Malcolm Turnbull: Sobering. Chilling. And timeless words. A reminder that a safe Australia, a safe world, needs a strong Australia. Thanks for all the feedback on last week’s episode of the campaign podcast, which focused on opinion polling. I asked for thoughts from fellow pollsters about the analysis shared by the Liberal party’s pollster Mark Textor about tactical voting. Scott Steel, who works for the union movement in Queensland, and blogs as Pollytics, has contributed some thoughts about the pod conversation. I don’t know why, I’ll ask him why. But first, the prime minister, who addressing the RSL. Scott Morrison is asked whether the Coalition has been gazumped on childcare. Certainly not, the treasurer says. Labor doesn’t have a policy, therefore the Coalition can’t be gazumped. Scott Morrison: Labor’s policy is a fantasy, a fiction – there’s no money to pay for it. You cannot spend money that’s not there. Scott Morrison is asked about the new Turnbull ad which features the prime minister talking about his father, and growing up in a single parent household. The Liberal party is pushing this ad through Facebook. Calla mentioned this ad to you all earlier today. Q: Is the party concerned about a certain perception of him? Scott Morrison: No. He’s then asked about the big spend in marginal seats. The treasurer says the spending is a way to support grass roots initiatives. Scott Morrison: The government supports community funding. The treasurer is then asked whether the government can afford its own delayed childcare package given it can’t get the savings measures through the Senate? Scott Morrison: We are having an election and we are putting savings measures to the election. Morrison says its easy to splash about unfunded spending, it’s much harder to make sure you can pay for things. There is another lengthy preamble in this outing – Labor’s manifest horrors take time to outline in detail – but Scott Morrison has turned down his volume dial from the extreme nonsense outing last week. (Everything is relative.) Voters can choose on July 2, Morrison says. Certainty and stability versus chaos and uncertainty. The treasurer, having cleared his throat on the Hadley show, has now found reporters in Sydney to deliver his mid-campaign report. Scott Morrison is sticking with his war on business and growth rhetoric but thus far we’ve avoided toxic taxes and toxins. The treasurer diagnoses his patient: Labor is making promises with money that simply isn’t there. Labor is not committing to savings necessary to funding policies like childcare. Scott Morrison: Labor always promises big for families but doesn’t deliver. I’m not the only person with a mid-campaign stocktake this morning, it would seem. Here comes the treasurer, Scott Morrison. While the Labor leader was speaking to reporters, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has been chatting with Ray Hadley on 2GB and the subject is a new poll showing the Greens and independents set to win one in four votes. Morrison said: “There are two real alternatives at this election: one is the re-election of a Coalition government, with the continued stability, or a Labor-Greens-independent minority outcome.” “Now obviously that is something we all remember from less than three years ago. What that’s a recipe for is continued chaos ... Chris Bowen, the shadow treasurer, has already said he would have to wait 100 days, after the election, before you find out what his economic plan is. And the reason is he’d have to work out what was in the head of his deputy treasurer, Adam Bandt, Nick Xenophon and others. “It’s the return of that fellow up in Armidale, who together with Rob Oakeshott, caused merry hell, Tony Windsor, with the previous minority government. That’s just a recipe for chaos.” Hadley said Coalition strategists are telling him the government’s company tax plan is not cutting through. Morrison does not agree, small business owners are telling him “thank you for backing us”, he said. “They are the hope of the side for the economy.” Hadley backed Bill Shorten’s comments that women by and large organise childcare. Shorten has copped some flack on feminist grounds that it’s a sexist stereotype that women are responsible for care. Hadley said: “I don’t think Shorten is doing anything other than describing how it is.” Morrison said organising care of children “is a family responsibility” and a responsibility for both parents, however they decide to share the load. Morrison didn’t criticise Shorten, who he said can “explain his own words”, and instead pivoted to how Labor would pay for the $3bn cost of its childcare policy. “We put savings into the parliament, more than $3bn ... and they opposed [them], which means their cupboard is bare when it comes to paying for this.” Hadley suggested the Senate could block the savings again after the election, which brings us back to the start of the interview – will the Coalition win and win big enough to do what it’s promising? Q: You have agreed to do the Sky News people’s forum on Wednesday, not yet agreement from Mr Turnbull, are you hoping he comes round to the idea? Bill Shorten: I think Mr Turnbull should give an answer to our challenge to attend the Sky News forum. Mr Turnbull is clearly doing whatever he can to avoid facing the real issues. These people forums are a great opportunity for Mr Turnbull to leave the bubble in which he is occupying and hear what people are really talking about and give them the answers to the questions they are asking. It is discourteous to Sky and the people of Queensland that Mr Turnbull won’t give an answer. It confirms Mr Turnbull can’t talk about his own policy agenda because he doesn’t want to. All he can do is talk about Labor. I’ll be there Wednesday night. Q: To anyone thinking about a protest vote, that would be a return to the chaos of the Rudd-Gillard years. At that last debate you were asked how people should trust you. Bill Shorten: First of all, Mr Turnbull engineered his own chaos on Mr Abbott. The evidence is why Labor is ready to be government of this country is the last thousand days. We are far more united than the Liberal party and rolling out far more positive policies, able to explain how we would fund them. We would be a government of priorities of middle-class and working-class Australians. You can trust Labor to fight for Medicare, to properly fund schools, trust Labor to take real action on climate change, trust Labor to have a fair taxation system and ensure first home buyers aren’t locked out of the housing market. You can trust Labor to ensure women get equal treatment and trust Labor to deliver childcare that is fair and faster. I will finish on that note. Bill Shorten gets three questions on wages in the childcare sector. I want to put on the record Labor supports the work of our childcare workers. They are the early years educators. The childcare workers are the first people that families entrust their kids to when they leave home [and] go to childcare so we think they are an important part of our work force and haven’t been sufficiently valued. Q: Yesterday you said when you announced the original childcare policy that men in Australia rely on the women in Australia to do the childcare and organise the childcare. Is that comment not sexist? Do you regret making those comments? Bill Shorten: Thanks for asking the question. Men are stepping up in terms of childcare. In this centre you will have noticed dads here absolutely pulling their weight but the fact of the matter is that the burden of childcare falls disproportionately on working mums. Labor wants to make sure a government is backing up working parents in Australia and backing up working mums, full stop. Q: The latest polls – you’ve lost – Labor has lost its lead over the Coalition. You still continue to trail Malcolm Turnbull as preferred prime minister. You say you’ve got positive policies but are you worried these aren’t getting reflected to the Australian people? Bill Shorten: I think the record reflects in the last number of months Australians are listening to Labor’s positive policies. I’m enjoying this campaign. I didn’t ask Mr Turnbull to call an eight-week campaign but Labor has been ready for this election, we have been working on our policies. A question about the CFA dispute in Victoria, then ... Q: You say you can afford these childcare changes. The government insists you can’t. Australians can’t make a meaningful judgement on that until we see Labor’s costings. On what date in this campaign will Labor make public its costings and if you can’t tell us that, why shouldn’t we believe you’re just delaying it to prevent scrutiny of these costings until late in the campaign? Bill Shorten: Tim, I don’t accept the assumption of your question. The opposition I lead, the united opposition I lead, has changed the rules of political debate in this country over the last 12 months by putting forward our positive policies and explaining where we would make saves. There is another four weeks to go in this election. So we haven’t unveiled all our policies. When we have unveiled all of our policies, at that point we will outline our final costings and measures. Let’s not airbrush what happened before the calling of this election. History didn’t start on the day that Mr Turnbull called the election. It’s been unfolding ever since he became the prime minister. In the same time that he’s wandered across the paddock with GST increases, with proposals now for a corporate tax splash, Labor’s been outlining how we will improve the bottom line. I’m happy to remind you yet again: $32bn saved by winding back unsustainable tax concessions to negative gearing and capital gains tax discount. $50bn saved by not passing over a truck load of budget money to large corporations. $17bn saved by not proceeding with a tax cut for people who earn a million dollars a year. The Emissions Reduction Fund, Mr Abbott’s climate sceptic dream, we are going to save billions of dollars by not proceeding with that. We have said we will stop the rorts in vocational education. Billions of dollars there. Labor has led the debate on making multi-nationals pay their fair share. Labor has led the debate about improving the sustainability of our superannuation tax concession system. That saves billions of dollars. Labor has done what the government’s shown it can’t do. We have put forward an alternative economic approach and at the core of our measures, we are investing in education because that invests in the economy. We are investing in infrastructure because that invests in the economy. We are investing in childcare because that invests in the economy. We are investing in the environment by taking real action on climate change. Labor has got its policies well and truly lined up. Hold on to your hats because the next four weeks you will see more positive policies which make a practical difference in the lives of all Australians. Q: What’s your advice to anyone thinking about voting for the Greens and independents? Will you negotiate with whoever holds the balance of power? Bill Shorten answers the first question but not the second one. Don’t do it. Vote Labor. Labor’s got the best policies. If you care about the environment, Labor has proper policies for climate change. If you care about the education of your young, Labor has funded policies for schools, TAFEs, universities – now we are outlining childcare. If you care about real action in terms of the NBN, Labor will outline its policy in coming weeks to make sure we have better internet speeds and access for more Australian households. If you care about defending Medicare, you should vote Labor. Q: If the waiting lists areas long as you say they are, how will an average of $300,000 per centre fix that crisis? Kate Ellis: Labor has said we will direct these fund only towards those areas where there is very high need that is not currently being met. We know today’s announcement will ensure we have thousands of additional places, and those places are located where the waiting lists are currently the longest and where supply is not meeting demand. Questions now. Q: You say today’s announcement is a reallocation of existing money. What is the government currently spending this money on? Bill Shorten doesn’t answer the specific question he is asked. We are backing in childcare because we think an investment in childcare is an investment in the future of this country. The opposition’s education spokeswoman, Kate Ellis: I want to turn to another forgotten part of the childcare sector. That is outside school hours care. If you actually have a look at what is acting as one of the biggest barriers against workforce participation, it’s a lack of places when it comes to outside school hours care. There are many parents who are seeking to return to the workforce but as a result of the fact that there are no places for their children after the school bell goes, they are having to turn down job offers and opportunities. That is because we know that the Australian workforce today doesn’t finish when the school bell rings at 3 o’clock. That is why we need to invest in outside school hours care. We are announcing a plan to expand up to 1,200 outside school hour care places across Australia to establish thousands of additional places so we know thousands of additional parents can return to the workforce. The Labor leader Bill Shorten is in Melbourne and has uttered the word game changer at least five times in the past sixty seconds. Having childcare is a game changer for families, a game changer for the economy. Bill Shorten: Today we are addressing the other big issue in childcare, which is finding a place – waiting lists. Today I’m pleased to announce that in the next three years Labor will put in $100m, which will provide literally thousands of extra places in areas where there are high demands. Everybody knows that if you can’t find a place for your child, that becomes the big issue as opposed to even just cost and the quality of childcare. Labor is persisting on childcare today, we’ll get part two of the policy which is worth about $160m. The government is persisting with questions about how yesterday’s $3bn childcare commitment will be paid for – where’s the money coming from Bill – before pushing into the agenda item of today, which is innovation. Overnight the Coalition has also attempted to neutralise one of the health issues on which is has been vulnerable. The health minister, Sussan Ley, says the government will commission an independent evaluation, in consultation with the sector, of the commercial pressures facing diagnostic imaging providers. A press release issued late yesterday by the health minister says “after many months of constructive consultations with the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association and its members, it [is] clear there were broader concerns about the unique commercial and regulatory environment within which they operated and how government investment was being targeted. Ms Ley said this included an understanding there was a need to align the MBS schedule fees on some items, which may not adequately reflect the actual cost of delivering the service. ‘Based on the independent evaluation, the government will also consider how best to ensure that the diagnostic imaging schedule fees keep pace with costs into the future.’” In simple terms, this pushes ultimate resolution of the rebates for diagnostic imaging off until after the election. Health’s a real hot spot in this campaign and Labor is leaving its firepower on this theme to the final, decisive weeks. Thanks Calla, good morning everyone and welcome to Monday. We’ve just passed the halfway point of the campaign, so I’d like to start this morning with a short stocktake. It’s now a truism in Australian politics that campaigns are all about the marginals. Over the weekend my colleague Lenore Taylor referenced the spend on CCTV cameras in marginal seats by the Coalition. Phil Coorey in the Financial Review has broken out his calculator and added up the government’s spend in the marginals over the last few weeks. He says the total outlay is $1.7bn. A couple of things can be observed about all of this. The Coalition in the national election conversation is appealing to voters not to do anything rash – don’t vote Labor, don’t vote independent, end the terrible unproductive churn in Canberra, just elect the Turnbull government and allow it to govern. Malcolm Turnbull is presenting himself as the personification of stability, a figure calmly circumnavigating the country in a splendid Mackintosh coat, hands in pockets, steady pace almost like a wartime leader. In Canberra there’s a wonderful bronze statue of John Curtin and Ben Chifley walking to the old parliament house – if you glance up and catch Turnbull he looks exactly like that. There’s something nostalgic in the presentation. The government is repeating the same broad messaging day in day out (with some repositioning and tuning along the way) and making a virtue of not spending much. It’s Labor apparently doing all the spending. Except if you add up all the spending that’s being done below the radar. Various ministers have been deployed to sandbag various marginals armed with numerous small pots of money that will generate a local story. If you tally it all up, it’s not small money. In seats where it is beneficial for the prime minister to highlight the handout himself, he’ll do it. Turnbull did it in Mayo last week, and he’s done it in Higgins this morning, where the assistant treasurer, Kelly O’Dwyer, is facing pressure from the Greens in her seat. So what is the sum of these parts? At one level, the national contest, the one we all follow slavishly, doesn’t matter all that much apart from its capacity to create impressions about leadership: competence, in touch or out of touch, steady or radical, trustworthy or dissembling. If you segment the campaign in your head: national reassurance, local pork, the strategy becomes clear and makes sense. With those thoughts at the midpoint, let’s press on. A reminder today’s comments thread is open for your business. If the thread’s too bracing for you, Mike Bowers and I are up and about on the twits – he’s @mpbowers and I’m @murpharoo. If you only speak Facebook you can join my daily forum here. And if you want a behind-the-scenes look at the day and the campaign as a whole, give Mike a follow on Instagram. There’s some beauties there from yesterday. You can find him here. Channel your inner Churchill. Here comes Monday. I’ll hand over now to my esteemed colleague Katharine Murphy to guide you through the rest of this blustery day on the campaign trail. A warning to women and girls on the campaign trail: Malcolm Turnbull, enthusiastic grandfather and keen supporter of girls Doing All The Things, may steal your name to suggest to his daughter, Daisy, who would probably rather be left to gestate in peace. Speaking at that women in sport morning tea in Malvern, Turnbull urged all girls in attendance to look to their local member, Kelly O’Dwyer, as a role model. Girls can do everything. You can do anything and I want you to look at these women and recognise that there should be no limit to your ambitions. No limit at all. Whatever you dream of you can achieve. Whatever you think you might be able to do, whatever you imagine, you can do it. He also said hello to the boys in the room (“young man muching a bun there looking very good, you’re a good fellow and I welcome you too”) but the focus, which may become a trend at an STEM event later today, was on empowering girls. As we all know, there is no more empowering image for girls than a man standing between two women doing all the talking. While Shorten &amp; co talk childcare, Malcolm Turnbull will be eating scones for women in sport. Or something. The venue is the Malvern Town Hall, a gorgeous old building in Kelly O’Dwyer’s seat of Higgins and just up the road from where this correspondent sits gloomily sipping instant coffee. (Mike Bowers, who is currently following the PM, sounded a bit less fond of the building than I.) Nick Xenophon has told AM it was “highly unlikely” he would be negotiating with a minority government after 2 July, despite the palpable fear of some in the major parties. To paraphrase Mark Twain, rumours of my influence are much exaggerated.... I think it’s highly unlikely… I can’t see that the Coaltion will lose 15 seats and then be put into a hung parliament situation. The Nick Xenophon Team, is polling 3% nationally, according to today’s Newspoll. In South Australia support is 22%. He told AM he was hopeful of getting three senate spots, including his own, in SA, and maybe one more in NSW or Victoria. There’s all this fear and loathing toward myself and the team from the major parties, but the fact is we haven’t run one TV ad, one radio ad, because we simply don’t have the dough. So why are people turning away from the minor parties? Xenophon reckons it’s because they are quite dull. There are issues of substance to talk about, but we are not seeing that on the campaign trail. This is almost a Seinfeld election, it’s an election about not much at all. Before we get to a promised interview with Nick Xenophon on AM we should look to another independent, Andrew Wilkie in Tasmania, who is getting excited about the possibility of another minority government. (You may recall the last minority government, under Julia Gillard, went quite well for Wilkie.) He told ABC radio on Monday that he saw “a wonderful opportunity in the next parliament” for a strong crossbench, particularly a strong crossbench that supported his proposed poker machine reform. Xenophon supports gambling reform, but said a minority government was “a one-in-a-million chance.” Turnbull warned this weekend against “the chaos of a hung parliament,” which Xenophon said made him sound like Liberal leaders past: I’m surprised that Malcolm Turnbull is such a panic merchant and what he is saying doesn’t sound like Malcolm Turnbull. It sounds more like the sort of thing you’d expect Tony Abbott to be saying in an election campaign. To childcare next, which Labor hopes will be the focus of the campaign today. Bill Shorten will be at a childcare centre in Melbourne’s inner-west with Kate Ellis, Labor spokeswoman for early education, and the local Jagajaga MP and spokeswoman for family and payments, Jenny Macklin. He’s announcing an add-on to the $3bn package announced yesterday: $100m over three years targeted at 300 childcare services in areas of high demand, to reduce the waiting list. On AM this morning, the education minister, Simon Birmingham, said Labor’s policy was an unfunded band-aid solution that would see extra money going to child care providers, not back into the pockets of working families. In contrast, he said, the Coalition’s policy was “a wholesale reform to our childcare subsidy system”. Birmingham also defended the changes to the activity test, saying that most people would think it reasonable that people who are working or studying full-time were “standing at the front of the queue.” The Labor policy would begin in January 2017, the Coalition policy in July 2018. Let’s look a bit more at that firefighting fight in Victoria. The United Firefighters Union has been trying to negotiate a new industrial agreement over the Country Fire Authority (CFA) to improve conditions for professional firefighters and get greater control over the organisation to the detriment of volunteers, who say they are being pushed out of the organisation. The Fair Work Commission last week recommended the CFA accept the deal and cabinet is expected to try to push it through. The Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, supports the UFU, but the emergency services minister, Jane Garrett, has been at odds with them for months and has refused to instruct the CFA to sign the new EBA. She is reportedly considering quitting over the deal. Malcolm Turnbull wrote to Andrews on Friday asking him to withdraw support for the deal, then on Sunday he arrived at a protest of 2,000 CFA volunteers in Melbourne in opposition of the deal. Turnbull told the rally he may introduce changes to the Fair Work Act: I give you this pledge: if we are returned to government on the 2nd of July, we will ensure the law is changed to protect you from this takeover... We will stand with every one of you. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, told the Herald Sun the federal government would do what it could to prevent what she described as a “hostile takeover,” by the union. “A union takeover of the CFA would pose a grave risk to the safety of thousands of Victorians who rely on CFA volunteers to protect them.’’ Bill Shorten has maintained his distance, saying it was a state issue, but he’s likely to be pressed on it while in Melbourne today. Meanwhile, The Age reports that the Victorian Equal Opportunities and Human Rights Commission has ruled that up to 12 clauses of the deal could be discriminatory towards women, parents, carers, and people with disabilities. Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten took a break from being adversarial yesterday to attend a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the RSL. Mike Bowers was there in Melbourne last night. Four weeks down, four to go. Good morning, and welcome to what would usually be the pointy end of the election campaign but is instead the bump in the middle. Time to lip-sync your favourite pop-song for the halftime entertainment and make a cup of tea before we sink into week five, day 29, of the election campaign. Thanks to Melissa Davey for taking the early shift for the past two weeks. I’ll be with you until m’learned colleague, Katherine Murphy, and the rest of the Canberra team take charge at 8.30am. Right, got that cup of tea? Then let’s begin. The big picture Newspoll in The Australian this morning has the Coalition up one point in two-party-preferred terms, which puts the major parties at 50-50. Which is interesting, but less interesting than its other finding, which is that support for independents and minor parties has grown three points to 15%. That’s the highest it’s been in the pollster’s 31-year history. If you include the Greens vote in the mix, it shows that one in four people plans to vote for someone other than the major parties. The Australian reports: While the two-party-preferred vote sees the first improvement for the Coalition since April — from 49 per cent to 50 per cent — the government’s primary vote has dropped one point to 40 per cent, which is the lowest level since the Prime Minister replaced Tony Abbott as leader almost 10 months ago. Labor’s primary vote has also fallen for the second consecutive Newspoll survey, dropping one point to 35 per cent, while the Greens lost one point to fall to a six-month low of 10 per cent. That 5% support for independents and micro-parties breaks down as 3% for the Nick Xenophon Team (that’s the national vote – in South Australia it’s polling at 22%), 3% for Family First, 1% for Palmer United Party, 1% for One Nation and 7% for all the rest. It appears to indicate that the Senate voting changes may not result in a friendlier upper hourse. The poll also suggests that if the Coalition was returned it would face a repeat of the difficulties from the last parliament in passing legislation through the Senate and would rely on a crossbench principally controlled by Senator Xenophon, in cases where it could not secure the support of Labor or the Greens. While voters think about new parties, Malcolm Turnbull was in Melbourne yesterday for a bit of classic wedging. He joined a protest of CFA volunteers against a pending industrial relations deal between the firefighting body and the United Firefighters Union, which volunteers say is designed to push them out of the organisation. The Age reports that the Andrews government, which backs the union, could push the deal through as early as today. Turnbull promised volunteers that he would protect their rights. And the Greens want to regulate to ensure a “fair price” is paid for solar energy. Gabrielle Chan reports: The policy, to be launched on Monday by the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, and MP Adam Bandt would force a “fair price” to be paid by energy companies. Solar homes and businesses would be protected from fees and charges “likely to be imposed by electricity networks clawing back their diminishing revenues as our electricity system decentralises and consumers become empowered”, the policy says. On the campaign trail Both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten have started the day in Melbourne. Shorten is continuing to campaign on Labor’s $3bn childcare policy, released yesterday. Gabrielle Chan reports: The centrepiece is a 15% increase in the Child Care Benefit (CCB) as well as a rise in the childcare benefit cap from $7,500 to $10,000. Labor has said every family earning under $150,000 will benefit from the change. Labor’s finance spokesman, Tony Burke, said the policy was a stark contrast to the Coalition, which has delayed rebate rises until 2018. “Any child who was born when the government first announced they were going to do something about childcare will be in school by the time their policy comes in,” Burke said. “We’re not willing to wait. So we’d bring it all forward to 1 January. For the people who are reliant on the childcare benefit, that increases by 15%. That means for low to middle income earners up to $30-a-week improvement for them.” The campaign you should be watching Rural Australia is frequently ignored in election campaigns, because its seats are usually safely held. That’s not the case any more: Indi, in Victoria, is the most marginal seat in Australia, held by independent MP Cathy McGowan on just a handful of votes, and even the deputy prime minister, Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, is facing a challenge in his electorate of New England from former independent MP Tony Windsor. My colleague Gabrielle Chan digs through the issues here. And another thing(s) The Liberal party has released a new set of campaign ads focusing on Malcolm Turnbull’s relationship with his father, Bruce Turbull. Turnbull has spoken before about being raised by a single-father in a two-bedroom flat, to show his “battler” roots. He elaborated in the video: “We didn’t have much money, he was a hotel broker and for most of that time he was battling like a lot of people are, a lot of single parents are, certainly. But he taught me a lot of amazing things ... And he did well after a while; in the latter part of his life he kicked a few goals after a lot of effort. He was incredibly loyal, very, very strong, very disciplined. I was the main object of everything he wanted to achieve. He was very focused on doing what was right for me. And finally, Mayo is apparently the happiest electorate in Australia, according to the Personal Wellbeing Index, conducted by the Deakin University Australian centre on quality of life. The result is reportedly based on polling of 154 Mayo residents, of which the sitting member, Liberal MP Jamie Briggs, who is facing a significant challenge from his former staffer and Nick Xenophon party candidate, Rebekha Sharkie, was apparently not one. AAP reports: Residents of Australian’s federal electorates - more than 100 from each and a total of more than 24,000 - were polled on how satisfied they were with their standard of living, health, relationships, achievements in life, safety, community connections and future security. At the other end of the scale was the seat of Blaxland, held by Labor MP Jason Clare, in Sydney’s south-west."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/turk-telekom-low-carbon-country","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-17T08:56:27Z","webTitle":"Türk Telekom: making the case for a lower-carbon country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/turk-telekom-low-carbon-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/turk-telekom-low-carbon-country","fields":{"headline":"Türk Telekom: making the case for a lower-carbon country","bodyText":"Turkey's leading telecommunications group Türk Telekom is using the power of technology to lead the fight against climate change. As a large communications group with sustainability at its heart and one of Turkey's largest employers, the company is promoting the possibilities and advantages of a low-carbon economy for the country. The move is supported by a campaign called Environment-Friendly Communication, which aims to engage stakeholders ranging from employees and business customers to investors and the public. But the message starts with the way Türk Telekom itself operates. Since 2011 it has introduced a range of carbon reduction measures and become the first Turkish telecoms company to report to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Among recent initiatives are: new lower-carbon products and services; striking messages about sustainability directed at the public; training on climate change for 1,200 company directors and online environmental training for Türk Telekom's 24,000 employees. According to its latest CDP report, the company's carbon emission mitigation was equal to a 4,400 hectare forest in 2012. The plan is to equal a 5,400 hectare forest by 2014. Initiatives include the replacement of 45,296 business flights annually with teleconference meetings and the recycling of 480 tonnes of paper a year, saving 7,680 trees. The company has also pioneered renewable energy use with the installation of more than 1,000 solar energy panels in 52 cities, generating 2,190 MWh of electricity a year. It estimates a carbon emissions reduction of 1,420,000Kg from this initiative alone. Taking its practices into the public domain, Türk Telekom organised Turkey's first carbon-neutral press conference, broadcasting relevant reports and interviews to more than 11 million people on national TV. Meanwhile, it is also the first Turkish company to join the Global e-Sustainability Initiative – a collaboration of international ICT companies that advocate sustainable business and technology's potential to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The perishing cold has stopped lots of plants in their tracks, although there have also been some benefits, with snowdrops and crocuses enjoying an unexpectedly long flowering season. And when the weather was a lot milder earlier in March, the very earliest spring flowers managed to get going, such as colt's foot, which looks like a dandelion, and lesser celandine, a golden star-shaped flower and cousin of the buttercup. The lesser celandine has the uncanny knack of craning its flowers round to track the sun during the day, presumably to trap solar energy to entice early insects into its warm embrace, but when skies turn overcast the petals close up altogether. The lesser celandine was also William Wordsworth's favourite flower, who wrote three poems about it. Maybe spring will not get underway until well into April, with wild daffodils, primroses, wild garlic and many other familiar flowers, and as for bluebells they probably will not flower until well into May. But maybe this late appearance is no bad thing, because a long slow spring gives more time to appreciate the flowers, especially compared to the extraordinary explosion of springtime in the heatwave of last March. And perhaps this spring is not such a freak event as something of a nostalgic return to the cold springtimes of many years ago, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, when late springs were much more common."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/09/global-warming-humans-not-sun","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-09T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Global warming is being caused by humans, not the sun, and is highly sensitive to carbon, new research shows | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/09/global-warming-humans-not-sun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/09/global-warming-humans-not-sun","fields":{"headline":"Global warming is being caused by humans, not the sun, and is highly sensitive to carbon, new research shows","bodyText":"Over the past few weeks, several important new papers related to human vs. natural climate change have been published. These papers add clarity to the causes of climate change, and how much global warming we can expect in the future. First, a paper published in the Journal of Climate by Jara Imbers, Ana Lopez, Chris Huntingford, and Myles Allen examines the recent IPCC statement that expressed with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. One of the main challenges in attributing the causes of global warming lies in the representation of the natural internal variability of the Earth's climate. The study used two very different representations of natural variability. The first model assumed that the present climate has a short and finite memory, and is mostly determined by the recent past. The second model assumed that the climate's internal variability has long memory and the present climate is influenced by all the previous years. The authors then incorporated each of these representations of natural variability with a statistical approach to estimate the individual contributions of the various factors (e.g. the sun, volcanoes, greenhouse gases) to the increase in average global surface temperature. In each case, the study found that the greenhouse gas-global warming signal was statistically significant, supporting the robustness of the IPCC statement on human-caused global warming. As lead author Jara Imbers told me, \"...we investigate two extreme cases of the plausible temporal structures of the internal variability, and we find that the anthropogenic signal is robust and significant.\" Second, a paper published in Nature Geoscience by Andrew Schurer, Simon Tett, and Gabriele Hegerl investigates the sun's influence on global climate changes over the past 1,000 years. Although we know the sun can't be causing the current global warming because solar activity has declined slightly over the past 50 years, \"it's the sun\" nevertheless remains one of the most popular climate contrarian arguments. However, in recent years, research has pointed in the direction of a relatively small solar impact on the Earth's climate changes. It's important to realize that while the Earth is bombarded by a lot of heat from the sun, the amount of solar energy reaching the planet is relatively stable. According to the best recent estimates, it's only increased by about 0.1 percent over the past 300 years, causing a global energy imbalance less than 10 percent as large as that caused by humans over the same period. In this study, the authors tested reconstructions that incorporated relatively large and small changes in solar activity, and compared them to northern hemisphere temperature reconstructions over the past millennium. The reconstruction using a stronger solar influence (green) was a worse fit to the temperature data (blue) than the reconstruction with the weaker solar influence (red), especially around the 12th century. As in the Imbers paper, this study used a statistical approach to determine the contribution of each factor in the measured temperature changes. The authors conclude, \"Volcanic and GHG [greenhouse gas] forcings seem to contribute most to pre-twentieth-century climate variability, whereas the contribution by solar forcing is modest, agreeing with the simulations with low solar forcing.\" The study finds that the sun is unlikely to have caused more than 0.15°C of the observed approximately 1°C warming over the past 300 years. The authors find a detectable greenhouse gas influence on the climate before the 20th century, and consistent with the IPCC and Imbers, they conclude that humans are the dominant cause of recent global warming. \"Over the twentieth century, anthropogenic forcings dominate with GHGs the largest forcing, offset by the effect of anthropogenic aerosols and land use changes\" However, the authors note that while the sun has little impact on average hemispheric and global temperatures, it does have a significant influence on regional temperatures, for example in Europe. Finally, a paper published in Nature by Steven Sherwood, Sandrine Bony, and Jean-Louis Dufresne examines the role that clouds will play in the sensitivity of the global climate to the increased greenhouse effect. To this point, cloud responses to global warming have remained a key uncertainty. We know that a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will cause a bit more than 1°C global surface warming by itself, and we know that there are several feedbacks that will amplify that warming. The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere – another greenhouse gas – increases as the planet warms, amplifying that warming. This is the single largest feedback, and is increasing as climate scientists expect. We also know that melting ice makes the planet less reflective, causing it to absorb more sunlight, also amplifying global warming. And carbon released from various sources like beneath melting permafrost and from burning peatlands will also increase the greenhouse effect as another positive feedback in a warming world. However, we know of few significant negative feedbacks that will offset these effects and dampen global warming. The reckless contrarian approach is dependent upon the climate being relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, which requires that something offset all of these warming feedbacks. Clouds, whose responses in a warming world have been difficult to pin down, were the contrarians' last and best hope. An increase in cloud cover in response to global warming would reflect more sunlight back out to space, thereby cooling the Earth and offsetting some of those positive warming feedbacks. The authors of the Nature study examined cloud change simulations in relatively low and high sensitivity climate models. As summarized by Rob Painting, they found that the less sensitive models were incorrectly simulating water vapor being drawn up to higher levels of the atmosphere to form clouds in a warmer world. In reality (based on observations) warming of the lower atmosphere pulls water vapor away from those higher cloud-forming levels of the atmosphere and the amount of cloud formation there actually decreases, resulting in another amplifying global warming feedback. Lead author Steven Sherwood describes the study in the video below. These results are consistent with Fasullo &amp; Trenberth (2012), who found that only the higher sensitivity climate models correctly simulated drying in key cloud-forming regions of the atmosphere. Likewise, preliminary results by scientists at the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory presented at the 2013 AGU meeting showed that higher sensitivity models do the best job simulating observed cloud changes. These results are also consistent with Lauer et al. (2010) and Clement et al. (2009), which looked at cloud changes in the Pacific, finding the observations consistent with a positive cloud feedback. To summarize, the evidence that humans are the dominant cause of the current global warming is overwhelming (which is the reason behind the 97 percent expert consensus), and continues to grow. And while the media has lately tended to focus on the few papers that suggest climate sensitivity is relatively low, there is a growing body of evidence based on cloud observations that it's actually on the high end, above 3°C warming in response to doubled CO2, which under business as usual would lead to more than 4°C warming by 2100 – a potentially catastrophic scenario. In short – it's us, it's bad, and if we don't change course, it's a potential catastrophe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/feb/08/richard-branson-caribbean-green-virgin-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-08T12:26:33Z","webTitle":"Richard Branson pledges to turn Caribbean green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/08/richard-branson-caribbean-green-virgin-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/feb/08/richard-branson-caribbean-green-virgin-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Richard Branson pledges to turn Caribbean green","bodyText":"The palm trees and billiard table have been shipped in, work on the infinity pool overlooking the coral reef is progressing and the tennis courts are celebrity-ready. But few of the super-luxury buildings rising on Moskito island's beaches are finished yet. Moskito is Sir Richard Branson's number two Caribbean island, but it will soon be his new family complex. It is just over a mile from Necker island, which he bought in his 20s for £250,000 and now rents for £40,000 a night. Both islands are eco-trophies for Britain's best-known entrepreneur, but his plans to ditch the use of diesel power and to generate electricity from wind and solar are expected to have a profound impact on dozens of far poorer nearby islands facing crippling debt, hurricanes and climate change. Last week Branson hosted a summit of financiers, politicians, energy companies, lawyers and others on Moskito and Necker to work up a plan to \"green\" the Caribbean, island by island. Five prime ministers and 12 governments, as well as international bankers and investors, heard renewable energy experts explain how the region's islands, which currently generate nearly all their electricity from diesel, could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year and reduce emissions by 50% or more. Necker and Moskito will be 75-80% converted to use renewable energy and become working models for how other islands could cut expensive diesel imports, while all Caribbean governments will be offered a technical and financial blueprint on how to switch, by US energy thinktank the Rocky Mountain Institute and Branson's green business group, Carbon War Room. So far the governments of Aruba, St Lucia, the British Virgin Islands, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, the Turks and Caicos, Dominica and the Colombian islands of Providencia and San Andrés have said that they will aim to increase their use of renewable energy and cut diesel imports. Last week the US government's private-sector lending arm said it would support the efforts by the islands to go green by offering loans of up to $250m for renewable energy and energy-saving projects. \"This is personal and global. Moskito is now our family home. We know that islands will suffer the most from climate change and sea-level rise. Reefs will be devastated, and wildlife decimated,\" Branson told the Observer in an interview. \"It's realistic to think that whole islands could be 75-80% clean energy in four to five years. It might not make sense to do the last 25%, but they all ought to be able to go 75-80% using wind and solar energy. \"Governments [here] need help. I think a lot of ministers may be new to the job; they can't be experts at climate or energy. Some need a helping hand to make the transition to renewables. We can really save families 40% of what they have to pay for electricity,\" he said. The irony of a man whose rail and airline companies are significant climate polluters trying to \"green\" small island states is not lost on Caribbean governments. Branson said it has led him to invest heavily in green fuels, solar panels and other \"clean-tech\" developments. \"There is no question that Virgin is involved in a number of businesses that emit a lot of carbon, and that is one of the reasons why I have to work particularly hard … but, more importantly, to try to help other people balance their books as well,\" he said. However, he said he has lost many millions of pounds in failed green investments. \"We have invested hundreds of millions in clean technology projects. We haven't made hundreds of millions profit. \"We had to write off a $50m investment in [US solar panel manufacturer] Solyndra in 2011. We went in with the best of intentions. The thing was that the price of solar had collapsed in China. So from a global perspective it could be said to be positive. We got in quite early. Pioneers can always come a cropper, like Freddie Laker. They often pave the way for others. But we are still standing, and investing.\" Branson's investments in cleaner aviation fuel continue, but are nowhere near ready to scale up for commercial use. Peak oil – the expected point of maximum global oil production before it starts to decline – and a widely predicted hike in fuel prices have not happened and, if anything, he said, the world should expect the oil price to fall rather than rise in the next few years because of fracking. Branson said he has high hopes for LanzaTech, a company that has pioneered a way to turn carbon-rich waste gases from aluminium producers and other industrial plants into biofuels. According to Virgin Atlantic, the fuel has the potential to cut aviation emissions by 60% compared with conventional fuels and could produce enough biofuel to meet 19% of global demand for aviation fuel. \"We still need a clean aviation fuel, though. It will take a while longer. But we know it works,\" he said. British author Tom Bower calculated in his new book, Branson, Behind the Mask, that the entrepreneur had lost $300m in failed green investments and used the British Virgin Islands to hide his accounts in a succession of 11 companies. \"He, most unusually, invested his own money and has lost most of it; and all his claims have proved to be wrong – namely: peak oil, oil prices, Virgin's use of alternative fuels and the potential profits,\" Bower said. The author accused Branson of not understanding the science or human costs of biofuels, and latching on to green businesses for political motives and profit, rather than for environmental reasons. \"He embraced environmentalism and aligned himself with Clinton and Gore, to get on the top table of US and British politics,\" said Bower. Branson shrugs off the criticisms, saying he has been an active environmentalist since his student hippy days and that, rather than him using the environment to get to politicians, it is more a case of politicians using him. Tony Blair, Al Gore, Bill Clinton and other politicians have visited Necker, but not David Cameron, whom Branson strongly supports for his commitment to nuclear power. \"I would say he is doing his best. I think they are trying to meet [emission] targets. Cameron has been brave with nuclear, from a global point of view. Germany backtracking on nuclear is worrying. Nuclear has got safer and safer; we can now use waste products of nuclear,\" he said. \"If you accept that the globe has a major problem [with emissions], then you can't leave nuclear out of the equation. I have studied how many people have been killed in nuclear accidents – it's less than 1,000. \"One Chinese coalmine disaster can kill more than that. If you have a global catastrophe, you have to take extreme measures. Nuclear seems to be an important weapon that the world has.\" More controversially, along with billionaires such as Bill Gates, Branson supports the idea of high-risk, quick technological fixes to \"geo-engineer\" the global climate if emissions were to get out of control. This could involve sucking carbon out of the air or spraying millions of tonnes of reflective particles of sulphur dioxide 30 miles above the Earth to cool it. \"I call it re-engineering,\" he said. \"There's a subtle difference, trying to re-engineer the world back to roughly where it is today. It's controversial, but we would be mad not to look at the technologies. If there are any risks attached, it would need the UN to decide whether the risk is worth taking … hopefully it won't be necessary. Hopefully we can come up with something more mundane than the radical answer.\" Branson said the environment is now his overriding preoccupation. He is seeking to set up a Caribbean-wide marine zone where no sharks are killed, and has lobbied heavily for a marine park around Australia. He is also involved in protecting wildlife in Africa. \"I find it interests me a lot more than making a few more bucks; it's much more satisfactory. I enjoyed building companies, but I find this more rewarding.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-enterprise-network/2013/jun/27/india-social-enterprise-income","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-27T07:00:21Z","webTitle":"Tapping into India's social enterprise potential","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/jun/27/india-social-enterprise-income","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/jun/27/india-social-enterprise-income","fields":{"headline":"Tapping into India's social enterprise potential","bodyText":"Affordable products, such as solar-powered lamps and mobile phone chargers, are often called innovations for low-income markets. But service models – such as outsourcing companies in rural areas generating local employment – can also be high-impact innovations. The common factor whether it is a product, service, process or technology is that innovations can create value for people on low incomes and improve their lives. Many enterprises in India show such innovations. Among them are lifestyle enterprise Mother Earth, rural hospital provider Vaatsalya and solar energy company Barefoot Power. But such enterprises must become more common to have a greater impact on society. In India, the growth of start-ups with strong social impact – especially those for low-income markets – is often challenging. Entrepreneurs lack global business exposure, especially in marketing and finance. This makes it difficult for an enterprise to expand and grow beyond its local and regional influence. Mentoring such enterprises could help. \"A mentor could convey industry knowledge, enable the enterprise leverage... and deepen business impact and profits,\" says Rohit Luthra, director at Progression Infonet Pvt Ltd and a mentor at Ennovent. But mentoring culture is weak in India. Vijay Pratap Singh, founder and managing director of Ekgaon [One village] says: \"This is a result of the majority of incubators either being focused on technology based innovations or being based in key metros only.\" Where relevant incubation for low-income market businesses does exist, there aren't adequate strategic partnerships, rendering such businesses a 'risky investment' for investors. Karan Gupta, India investments manager at Insitor Fund says: \"Yes, these incubators provide mentorship and in some cases access to funding. However, they need to focus on building strategic partnerships for entrepreneurs; without these partnerships the investors have to undertake higher risk which ultimately limits the number of ideas that can be successfully taken to markets.\" To overcome such challenges, the country needs more organisations like Ennovent to accelerate innovations. They provide a structured yet flexible mentoring approach as well as connections to a global community of investors, which helps generate investor-ready ventures. In India – especially in low-income markets – there is also a significant distinction between urban and rural ground realities. Move 30 miles away from a metro and the reality of this other India hits home. Here everyday urban accommodations – such as 24-hour access to electricity, safe drinking water or affordable healthcare – is a luxury. Thus when evaluating how an enterprise can prosper in low-income markets, entrepreneurs and investors must consider how local realities can impact consumption, production, distribution and operations. Moreover, how those realities may change swiftly between rural communities should also be considered. There is a great potential for social enterprises in India. But social entrepreneurs and start-ups need support at multiple levels, both from the government and from organisations such as Ennovent, to turn innovative ideas into products or services that can benefit the masses.

The first large ground system to feed into the national grid will benefit from the tariff scheme paying a premium for supplying clean electricity. Howbery business park's companies specialise in engineering, environmental and water research and development and its 3,000-panel array generates up to 682 MWh a year, a quarter of its needs, and thereby save 350 tonnes of CO2 a year. Derry Newman, chief executive of Solarcentury, the company that supplied the solar photovoltaic modules, said that the UK's famously overcast weather did not make it an unsuitable place for solar power. \"Solar works on daylight, not necessarily [direct] sunlight and it gets light every day in Britain,\" he said. \"Of course it generates more on a very bright day than a dull day. If you average over the year, the amount of cumulative daylight, energy per square metre, is very well known and is very predictable. Over the life of the system, the amount of energy produced is very predictable.\" Though the biggest in Britain, Howbery is dwarfed by those in Spain or Italy, up to 10 times bigger. Solarcentury, the panel maker, has similar projects due online next month, but these could be the UK's last big solar farms for some time. In February, the government announced a review of feed-in tariffs for anyone generating more than 50kW of power and cut the rates payable for large ground-mounted solar installations by more than 70%. \"This means that virtually all investors have withdrawn from financing such developments,\" said Newman. \"There were probably many hundreds lined up for development across the country. they're pretty much all cancelled now because of the fast track review. This type of installation will be a relative rarity for a few years.\" But Newman is optimistic about the solar industry in the UK, however. \"They will come back because tariffs and subsidies for solar are a necessary device to create the industry right now but the rate of change of price of solar is on a strong downward trend,\" he said. \"Within a few years, the amount of subsidy needed will go down significantly. When that happens, more of these can happen with less cost and become more attractive to investors.\" John Ormston, chief executive of HR Wallingford, which is based at the business park, said that Howbery Business Park was proud of its green credentials. \"A centre of excellence with two highly sustainable, BREEAM Excellent rated office buildings and an operational Green Travel Plan, we are committed to leading the way in renewable energy and are proud to be showcasing the UK's first solar business park. Howbery Business Park will be one of only a few business parks in the UK where occupiers are able to secure a direct electrical supply from a solar array.\" • This article was amended on 27th June.

The British Council is to launch Ice Lab, the first major international touring exhibition on buildings designed to allow human beings live, work, and relax safely in the coldest place on earth. Vicky Richardson, head of architecture and design at the council, said the new wave of Antarctic research stations showed great inventiveness in design and engineering. In the same way that scientists from around the world collaborate in Antarctica, these buildings are made possible by co-operation between nations, so it is highly appropriate that the British Council should be commissioning this exhibition.\" The most extreme proposal is only a concept, the Iceberg Living Station designed by MAP architects in Denmark, which avoids using conventional building materials. Instead it would use the caterpillar excavators employed in the Antarctic to clear snow, to tunnel into a large iceberg and hollow out a space large enough to hold a research station. Eventually, its purpose served, the iceberg would melt and all trace of the building would disappear. Many of the buildings already exist, including the British Antarctic Survey's Halley VI, which opened three months ago. Designed by Hugh Broughton Architects, it is located on a floating ice shelf 10,000 miles from the UK. The structure is designed to be self-sufficient for months, and to withstand winter temperatures of -55c as well as being a pleasant and interesting place for the scientists to live and work. Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Antarctic was conceived, designed, constructed and operated by the country's branch of the International Polar Foundation, its sleek aerodynamic stainless steel structure the first designed to be zero-emission. Warmed by wind and solar energy, it has no interior heating system. South Korea is one of the new players in Antarctic research, and its Jang Bogo base, by the Seoul-based firm Space Group, will be one of the largest bases designed to operate year round with up to 60 personnel, when it opens next year. The exhibition will have architectural drawings, models, photographs and films, as well as a light and audio show by the Glasgow-based aritst Torsten Lauschmann.

The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition has just released its third annual Solar Scorecard, which evaluates US makers of photovoltaic solar panels for their performance in recycling, emissions, worker rights and use of toxic materials. The group's director said it is seeing some danger signs for the industry, including declining market share among the companies most focused on sustainability and a reduction – from 14 to 10 – in the number of companies that answered the coalition's annual survey. Three of last year's respondents have either shut their doors or filed for bankruptcy. Solar manufacturers find themselves in a cruel paradox this year. The US market for solar panels is booming. In the first quarter of this year, the country installed 723 megawatts of solar, representing an increase of 33% from the same quarter last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The rapid uptake of solar power is spurred, in part, by falling prices for solar modules, caused by a global production glut. Razor-thin or nonexistent margins are leading to an industry consolidation. Sheila Davis, the executive director of the toxics group that issued the report, said that an industry with environmental stewardship at its heart is at risk of sacrificing its greenness. \"We don't think that's a good sign for the industry. If there's an economic downturn, the first people to go are the sustainability people, and we don't want to see that happen,\" she said. \"Sustainability should be a core of the solar industry model.\" The toxics coalition saw a few worrying signs in this year's scorecard. Two of last year's respondents, Sovello Solar of Germany and Scheuten Solar, owned by China but based in the Netherlands, went out of business in 2012. A third, Suntech Power, the Chinese firm that was once the world's largest maker of PV solar modules and a leader in sustainability initiatives, is in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings. These companies are among only a handful of industry players who have responded to the coalition's survey in the past. Two companies that did respond to the survey, both this year and in previous years, have seen their market shares drop significantly. Arizona's First Solar saw its share drop from 9.4% in 2011 to 6.9% in 2012, while China-based Trina Solar declined from 8.1% to 6.3%. First Solar, the only solar manufacturer that required its customers to recycle panels at the end of their 25-year lifespan, has discontinued the programme everywhere except in Europe, where such recycling is required by law. An SEIA spokesman disputed that the solar industry's commitment to green practices is fading and pointed to SEIA's environment and social responsibility charter, which deals with issues such as water, electricity use, recycling and waste. A handful of solar-panel makers, which together account for more than 50% of US solar panels, have signed the charter. They're currently refining it and plan to start reporting on key performance indicators later this year. Signatories include the highest-scoring companies on this year's SVTC scorecard: Chinese panel-makers Yingli Solar and Trina Solar, as well as California-based SunPower. Another signatory, Gehrlicher Solar of Germany, declared bankruptcy last month. \"Certainly the companies that are going out of business are scaling back, but the companies that are predominantly the leaders are continuing to dedicate resources to sustainability,\" said John Smirnow, SEIA's vice president of trade and competitiveness. First Solar, which drew criticism in the report for scaling back its recycling program, claims it did so in response to the desires of its customers. Commercial customers don't want to pay upfront for recycling 25 years from now, spokesman Stephen Krum said. Instead, customers are \"using their financial resources by dealing with the recycling issue at the end of life\". Among its other findings, the toxics coalition concluded that only three of the top 40 solar manufacturers report information about their emissions, while 12 post their targets for reducing their use of toxic chemicals on their websites.

Climate change has already arrived,\" said Christopher Loeak, president of the Marshall Islands, which will host the Pacific islands' annual summit, attended by most of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, including the US, China and the EU. The Marshall Islands, a group of 29 atolls and coral islands standing on average only two metres above sea level, and lying halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Earlier this year the president declared a state of emergency following a simultaneous drought and some of the worst floods ever experienced. A freak tide nearly destroyed the capital Majuro, breaching its sea walls and flooding the airport runway. The drought left 6,000 people surviving on less than one litre of water per day Many other small island Pacific \"microstates\", including the Solomons, Tuvalu and the Carteret Islands, have all suffered rapid erosion, higher tides, storm surges and inundation of wells with seawater. Earlier this year Kiribati's president, Anote Tong, predicted his country was likely to become uninhabitable between 30 and 60 years from now because of inundation and contamination of its freshwater supplies. Many of its outer islands are being invaded by the sea and people are flocking to the capital, South Tarawa. The state has plans to buy 2,000 hectares of land in Fiji to grow food for itself and possibly to act as a new island home. \"I say 'welcome to climate change' when people come here,\" said President Loek whose home island of Buoj has almost been washed away in the last few years. \"We will not stop telling people that it is a real issue for humanity. We will be the first to feel it, but it will come to them and they should realise it.\" The Marshalls and most other Pacific states hope that their physical vulnerability on the frontline of climate change will help galvanise world leadership in the stalled UN climate talks. They expect all countries at the Pacific summit, including the US, China and the EU, to sign the Majuro declaration of leadership that will focus attention on emission cuts before the expected resolution of the talks in 2015. The declaration will be presented to the UN at the talks in Poland in November. The islands, which produce less than 0.1% of the world's emissions, say they are leading by example. Most have started to substitute the expensive diesel they must traditionally import to generate electricity with renewable energy, including coconut power – biodiesel derived from homegrown coconut palms to power cars and outboard motors. The Marshall Islands has converted its outer island communities to solar energy and Tokelau has become the first territory in the world able to meet all its electricity needs with solar power. The Cook Islands and Tuvalu are aiming to get all of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Others plan to become self-sufficient in energy within 15 years. Many of the islands look to New Zealand, their closest large land mass, to give financial and diplomatic leadership. \"New Zealand can and should do more,\" said Loeak. \"They are the fifth highest per capita emitters in the world and Kiwi emissions continue to climb.\" EU climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard pledged last week to support the Pacific island states at the summit. \"These low-lying islands risk being swamped by rising sea levels and their inhabitants forced to emigrate. Weather extremes in the Pacific are not about a distant future. They have become the new normal. Heatwaves, floods, droughts and rising oceans are the new reality of an ever warming world. And this should not come as a surprise. Scientists have been warning for years that as the planet heats up, we will have to deal with more severe, more changeable, more unpredictable weather.\" \"The Pacific can count on Europe's co-operation and ambition. We count on the Pacific region to help us bring all other major economies on board the future climate regime,\" she said. Climate models all predict steadily rising sea levels as ice melts at the poles, but the higher tides being experienced in the Pacific have also been attributed to El Niño events and tectonic shifts. \"The longer we wait, I'm afraid we may reach the point of no return,\" said the Marshall Islands' foreign minister, Phillip Muller. \"We need to re-energise the international community and make them aware that there are countries that may not be in existence much longer.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/jun/10/tim-yeo-steps-aside-committee-chair-lobbying","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-10T19:27:07Z","webTitle":"Tim Yeo steps aside as committee chair amid lobbying claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/10/tim-yeo-steps-aside-committee-chair-lobbying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jun/10/tim-yeo-steps-aside-committee-chair-lobbying","fields":{"headline":"Tim Yeo steps aside as committee chair amid lobbying claims","bodyText":"The Conservative MP Tim Yeo, who is facing allegations of offering to advise energy companies for cash, has agreed to step aside temporarily as chairman of the energy and climate change select committee. Yeo made his decision after it became clear that Labour members of the committee were losing confidence in him and wanted him to step aside. He said on Monday that he needed time to concentrate on clearing his name with the parliamentary commissioner for standards, to whom he has referred his case. Yeo was elected to the select committee chairmanship and it is not clear if a fresh election will be held, or a temporary substitute will be appointed. The chairmanship is held by the Tory party as part of a wider distribution of select committee chairmanships between the political parties. The most senior Tory on the committee is Peter Lilley, a climate change sceptic in contrast with Yeo, who is a strong advocate of renewable energy. The Sunday Times recorded Yeo on tape saying that he had coached John Smith, the managing director of GB Rail Freight, on what to say in front of his committee. The reporters were pretending to act on behalf of a fictitious South Korean solar energy company. Yeo has denied the claims and said he did not ask questions at the relevant select committee hearing due to his declared financial interests, including being a director of GB Railfreight's parent company Eurotunnel. He also claims he only offered to represent companies, but do nothing in public. The shadow cabinet office minister, Gareth Thomas, had piled pressure on Yeo in advance of his announcement, saying: \"David Cameron has revealed how weak he is. He has failed to show leadership over serious allegations that Tim Yeo coached a witness to the energy and climate change committee, and used his position to further the interests of his clients. \"Tim Yeo has the right to defend himself but it is difficult to see how he can continue as chair of the select committee pending investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner. If David Cameron won't act then Tim Yeo should take it upon himself to stand down from his post.\" In a statement issued on Sunday, Yeo said: \"I did not 'coach' John Smith on this or any other occasion. He is not a 'paying client' as the Sunday Times alleges, but a business colleague. Like many business executives giving evidence to select committees he sought advice from the public affairs company retained for the purpose by GB Rail Freight.\" Yeo said that at no point had he agreed to work for the reporters' fictitious company. \"The whole recording would show the context of the conversation and demonstrate clearly that at no stage did I agree or offer to work for the fictitious company these undercover reporters claimed to be representing, still less did I commit to doing so for a day a month as the article claims.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/artists-claim-sustainability-power","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-17T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Artists have unique knowledge and must claim sustainability power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/artists-claim-sustainability-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/artists-claim-sustainability-power","fields":{"headline":"Artists have unique knowledge and must claim sustainability power","bodyText":"Icelandic-Danish installation artist Olafur Eliasson has achieved worldwide fame with his weather-related artworks: 2003 blockbuster Weather Project, The glacierhouse effect versus the greenhouse effect, the Cold wind sphere, the New York City waterfalls.

Their motivation for creating a work of art is not to profit at someone else's expense. As a result, art enjoys credibility and trust. And remember that throughout history, art has combined thinking and doing. After all, art is about taking a vision and turning it into reality. By contrast, many problems on the world stage exist because there's a huge disconnect between thinking and doing. You're moving more into practical action with Little Sun. How are the lamps getting to the people? Our company is 14-months-old and has produced and delivered 165,000 lamps to date. Our business partners, for example micro-entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe and micro-financed domestic workers in South Africa, have been very successful in delivering the lamps. We compete with kerosene and petroleum, which gives us a benchmark price. We need to be attractive to local users. But we also try to raise the issue about renewable energy. Little Sun isn't just about the 1.6 billion people who lack access to electricity. It's about the notion of our shared responsibility for the Earth's resources. I use it at home myself. It's not about \"us\" who have electricity and \"them\" who don't. When we met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, you were wearing a Little Sun around your neck. Do business leaders take you seriously, or do they dismiss you because you're an artist? When I'm in Davos and wear the lamp, it's a very efficient way of starting conversations with people. I went out in the mornings in Davos to charge my Little Sun outside my hotel room and could say, \"I just picked up the sun this morning.\" When people hear that, they take you seriously. And when I tell them that I started this project together with a solar engineer, I think they're quite happy that I'm not some hedge fund boss doing it. And there's another thing, as an artist I'm used to moving in many different circles: with NGOs, with politicians, with business leaders, with people at the bottom and the top of the pyramid. This gives me and other artists, unique knowledge. That creates respect. You've worked with Ethiopia's sustainability-focused, but rather authoritarian, government on the Little Sun project. Why Ethiopia? It's a country where around 80 million people live in relative density without access to energy. It's also a country whose government is very environmentally committed and thinks big. Right now, we're working with the government to try to open a factory in Ethiopia where we can produce Little Sun. Obviously, the government likes any business initiative, but particularly ones related to renewable energy, because most Ethiopian households currently use kerosene. Imagine if 80 million people went from using kerosene to using solar power! That's a whole lot of petroleum that wouldn't have to be imported to Ethiopia. You have said you use Little Sun at home. How sustainable are you? At my studio in Berlin, where we have 80 people working, we organise the way we cook and think about how we buy and eat it. We also have solar heaters, tubes on the roof where water passes through to be heated up by the sun. But it was only after having children that I started taking sustainability into a personal sphere. When I used Little Sun while reading bedtime stories to my daughter, we'd naturally start talking about how the light that naturally illuminates the book is the same sun that was outside in the garden earlier in the day. Like everyone else, I've been relatively sloppy, but in the past 10 years I've become less sloppy. Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

The preliminary decision, that China had dumped solar products on the US for less than the cost of manufacture, will result in tariffs of between 31% and 250% on Chinese imports. It was seen on Thursday as a mixed blessing. US solar panel makers, who brought the original complaint, are expected to benefit. But the tariffs, by forcing up prices, are expected to slow the adoption of solar power more generally. There were also fears the move could lead to a broader US-Chinese trade war. In its decision, the US commerce department said it would impose tariffs of about 31% on about 60 Chinese solar panel exporters which participated in the investigation, including Wuxi Suntech and Trina Solar. Other manufacturers will face tariffs of just under 250%. The levies will be retroactive for 90 days. The tariffs were in addition to fees ranging from 2.9% to 4.73% imposed last March. Chinese government subsidies helped drive down the price of solar panels by 80% over the last five years, and by 40% in the last year alone. The price drops drove some US solar panel makers – such as Solyndra – to collapse. The seven US-based solar panel makers which brought the complaint said the ruling from the commerce department would help American companies hold their own against Chinese competitors. The solar panel makers were struggling against Chinese competition, and weakening demand in Europe. \"Today's decision is expected to have an impact on the US marketplace for Chinese manufacturers since it will begin to remove the advantage they have had as a result of their illegal trade practices,\" the Coalition for American Solar Panel Manufacturing said in a statement. The statement went on: \"However, it will not disrupt solar growth or solar installations in the United States.\" But that is precisely the fear of other industry analysts. The falling costs for solar panels also made solar power more competitive with other sources of energy. The US solar industry grew by 109% last year. Jigar Shah, who heads the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy, told reporters Thursday's ruling will mean higher prices for consumers and will set back the adoption of solar. He also warned that China might retaliate against American manufacturers, sparking a trade war. Chinese officials have protested in the past at American accusations of unfair pricing and threatened to take America to the international trade court or WTO. \"We think it's raising taxes 31% on solar cells, and we think it's going to increase solar electricity prices in the US precisely at the moment that solar power is becoming competitive,\" Shah said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/18/global-warming-pause-meaning","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-18T04:25:24Z","webTitle":"Does the global warming 'pause' mean what you think it means? | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/18/global-warming-pause-meaning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/oct/18/global-warming-pause-meaning","fields":{"headline":"Does the global warming 'pause' mean what you think it means?","bodyText":"In their study of media coverage of the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, Media Matters for America found that nearly half of print media stories discussed that the warming of global surface temperatures has slowed over the past 15 years. While this factoid is true, the question is, what does it mean? Many popular climate myths share the trait of vagueness. For example, consider the argument that climate has changed naturally in the past. Well of course it has, but what does that tell us? It's akin to telling a fire investigator that fires have always happened naturally in the past. That would doubtless earn you a puzzled look from the investigator. Is the implication that because they have occurred naturally in the past, humans can't cause fires or climate change? The same problem applies to the 'pause' (or 'hiatus' or better yet, 'speed bump') assertion. It's true that the warming of average global surface temperatures has slowed over the past 15 years, but what does that mean? One key piece of information that's usually omitted when discussing this subject is that the overall warming of the entire climate system has continued rapidly over the past 15 years, even faster than the 15 years before that. The speed bump only applies to surface temperatures, which only represent about 2 percent of the overall warming of the global climate. Can you make out the tiny purple segment at the bottom of the above figure? That's the only part of the climate for which the warming has 'paused'. As the IPCC figure indicates, over 90 percent of global warming goes into heating the oceans, and it continues at a rapid pace, equivalent to 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations per second. Another important piece of oft-omitted information: while the warming of surface temperatures was relatively slow from 1998 to 2012, it was relatively fast from 1990 through 2006. Over longer time frames, for example from 1990 to 2012, average global surface temperatures have warmed as fast as climate scientists and their models expected. So what's changed over the past 10 to 15 years? The IPCC attributes the recent slowing of surface temperatures to a combination of external and internal climate factors. For example, solar activity has been relatively low and volcanic activity has been relatively high, causing less solar energy to reach the Earth's surface. At the same time, we're in the midst of cool ocean cycle phases, for example with a preponderance of La Niña events since 1999. A number of recent studies have suggested that most of the recent slowing of surface warming is due to these ocean cycles. What does that mean for the future? It means more global warming. A number of papers from climate 'skeptics' have sought to fit the surface temperature measurements with various cycles. Some have tried to attribute these changes to astronomical cycles, others to ocean cycles, others to 'stadium waves'. Ultimately these papers are just trying to explain the short-term wiggles in the data. For example, as Marcia Wyatt, lead author of the recent Wyatt &amp; Curry 'stadium waves' paper explained, \"While the results of this study appear to have implications regarding the hiatus in warming, the stadium wave signal does not support or refute anthropogenic global warming. The stadium wave hypothesis seeks to explain the natural multi-decadal component of climate variability.\" In other words, the surface temperature speed bump is mainly due to the short-term influences of natural climate variability on top of the long-term human-caused warming trend. As Mark Boslough recently noted, it all boils down to physics and conservation of energy. We continue to increase the greenhouse effect by burning more and more fossil fuels. The extra energy trapped in the Earth's climate system by that increased greenhouse effect can't just disappear, it has to go somewhere. Right now it just so happens that more is going into the oceans, whereas in the 1990s more was going into the atmosphere. Recently, Reiner Grundmann of the University of Nottingham asked, \"I think climate scientists should make up their mind: either there is a 'pause' in temp rise or there isn't. Is it result of cherrypicking? The answer is that there is a 'pause' if the data are cherry picked. First we have to cherry pick the 2 percent of global warming represented by surface temperatures and ignore the other 98 percent. Then we have to cherry pick a sufficiently short time frame to find a flat trend. Despite this double cherry picking, ignoring 98 percent of global warming, and despite the sun and volcanoes and ocean cycles all acting in the cooling direction over the past decade, the best climate contrarians can do is find a flat 10-year surface temperature trend. Can you guess what's going to happen the next time the oceans shift to a warm cycle? That's the thing about cycles – they're cyclical. Regarding the 'pause', Inigo Montoya would likely tell climate contrarians, \"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\" In terms of the threat from long-term global warming and climate change, it really doesn't mean anything. It just means that at the moment, more global warming is being absorbed by the oceans, but the next time ocean cycles shift, we'll experience accelerated surface warming just like we did in the 1990s. If we listen to the climate contrarians and wait for that to happen, the consequences will be ugly. We're only two to three decades away from blowing through our carbon budget. The speed bump simply doesn't give us any justification for delaying action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/nov/01/cutting-energy-bills-oldham-passivhaus","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-01T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"Actively cutting energy bills in Oldham – welcome to the 'Passivhauses'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/01/cutting-energy-bills-oldham-passivhaus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/nov/01/cutting-energy-bills-oldham-passivhaus","fields":{"headline":"Actively cutting energy bills in Oldham – welcome to the 'Passivhauses'","bodyText":"As the first bitter autumn wind whips off Crompton Moor, pensioner Inez and her son David, who live below in the Lancashire town of Oldham, have the heating on high and the double-gazed windows of their three-bedroom house tightly shut. They have just paid £550 for the gas they used over the three summer months and each time the bill goes up, life in their 1960s pre-cast concrete terrace house gets harder. This winter they expect to have to choose between warmth and other necessities. Fifty yards round the corner in St Mary's Close, Justine Hutton and her two children Kieran and Alissia watch TV in T-shirts in a similar-sized property. The single radiator is cold and they have a window open, although the temperature inside is 21C. The family will only pay around £20 to heat their home for the whole year. The only heat source is their bodies and the electric cooker. Inez's house is one of nearly 7m in Britain that have uninsulated solid walls and are little more than cold boxes. But Justine's is one of Britain's very few \"Passivhauses\" – super-low energy buildings (the German name translates literally to \"passive houses\"). It's packed with insulation, is triple-glazed and looks like any other new home, except for a box of tricks in the loft which uses warm air sucked out of the kitchen and bedrooms to heat fresh air being sucked in. \"I'd never heard of a Passivhaus and I don't know anything about climate change,\" says Hutton, who is about to start work as a healthcare assistant in Oldham hospital. She pays social housing group Contour £97 a week to rent the house which costs £95,000 to build. \"I Googled it but I was still sceptical. But it's great. There are no draughts and it's quiet. I was in a freezing council house which I used to pay £35 a week to heat, way more than 10% of our income, and it was still cold. It was horrendous what we were paying and it was a breeding ground for illness. They should definitely build more like this\". Nigel Banks, sustainability director of regeneration group Keepmoat, which has built this and nearly a third of Britain's other low-energy homes, said: \"We have found that we can build a three-bed Passivhaus for only about £20,000 more than a normal house, not the £50,000 extra that government thought when it relaxed building standards.\" The St Mary's development of 93 houses stands on old back-to-back Victorian streets which were demolished in the 1960s to make way for concrete-built flats which quickly deteriorated. The £14.8m scheme, which is paid in part with energy company \"green levy\" funds, has two Passivhauses and four other \"Code 6\" ones, which have enough insulation and solar energy to keep heating costs to about £3 a week. \"Britain can now build really low-energy houses massively cheaper than it could just a few years ago. But it's frustrating because the government has rolled back the building standards. If the green levy is dropped, then thousands of people in Oldham and elsewhere will stay cold and ill and it will cost the NHS dearly,\" says Banks. One mile away in Fitton Hill, Oldham council, a large housing group and Oldham NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) are investing £200,000 between them to retro-fit 1,000 cold homes with new boilers and exterior insulation. The health service calculates it will save £300,000 a year in reduced hospital admissions and social costs, and the council hopes each household will save around £450 a year. Each home also draws on energy company green levy money. \"Oldham is a cold town. It has got poorer health than most of the country. There's not much money about. Around one in five, or 20,000 homes here, are in fuel poverty,\" says Alan Higgins, director of Oldham council public health. \"We think each person lifted out of fuel poverty will save the health service about £250 a year. Data suggests there are 20% more deaths in Oldham in winter than in summer because of extra respiratory illnesses and heart problems [linked to cold homes]. If you get a cold winter and people cannot heat their homes, you get more people turning up in A&amp;E and suffering.\" Spray-painter Darryl-Paul Isaacs and his wife Alison say they saw a difference in health soon after the building work was done. Their son, Darryl-James, 12, is badly asthmatic and they are both prone to depression and other illnesses. \"It takes the pressure off us financially and mentally,\" says Darryl-Paul. \"There's no work round here. We'd normally take him to the doctor at this time of year. Not now. \"It's the stress. Sometimes he has to go to hospital for a nebuliser. As a parent if you can go a night without worrying that he'll have another attack and have to take three days off school, you feel better.\" \"We were paying about £450 a quarter for heating and the house was freezing. We had to sacrifice lots of things. A 10% rise in energy bills this year would definitely have pushed us over the edge.\" \"Energy price hikes really hurt here, especially with single elderly people,\" says Peter Beck, a building surveyor with Keepmoat. \"There is no way you can lift someone on a pension of £7,500 a year out of fuel poverty. Developments like this would just not happen without the green levy.\" The council and hospital will monitor the scheme over a year to try to measure the health benefits to people escaping fuel poverty. \"Addressing it is definitely the right thing to do. But it's not just about economics. The cost of fuel is going up out of all proportion to people's ability to pay. It's about the quality of a life, too,\" says Denis Gizzi, director of Oldham NHS CCG."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2013/sep/28/solar-investment-high-dividend-yields","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-28T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Investing: does solar offer a bright future … or burned fingers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/28/solar-investment-high-dividend-yields","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2013/sep/28/solar-investment-high-dividend-yields","fields":{"headline":"Investing: does solar offer a bright future … or burned fingers?","bodyText":"A major new fund is promising to pay a yearly dividend of 6%, tax-free if held in an Isa, from investing in eight of the biggest solar power farms across the UK. The days may be shortening after this year's long hot summer, but in the City of London interest in solar power has never been brighter. In the latest of a string of stock market funds investing in Britain's renewable power industry, asset manager Foresight is launching a £200m fund that says it will benefit from government subsidies and falling technology equipment costs. Foresight says solar power offers more predictable returns than wind farms, and will be buying the UK's largest solar park, built on a disused airfield at Wymeswold in Leicestershire. Others are in an earlier stage of development, but the plan is to have a total of eight farms, with a generating capacity of 146MW, or enough to power nearly 50,000 households. Around 40% of the revenue for the fund will come from the electricity produced by the solar panels and sold into the national grid, while the other 60% will come from payments linked to \"Renewable Obligations Certificates\" – green certificates used by electricity suppliers to demonstrate they have met their obligations to generate power from renewable resources. Britain's power companies have to meet a target of generating 15% of energy from renewable sources by 2020, and buy ROCs to meet that obligation. The price of the ROCs is fixed by the government and guaranteed for the next 20 years, rising in line with inflation. Earlier this year Bluefield Partners attracted £130m into its Solar Income Fund, while Renewables Infrastructure Group raised £300m for wind and solar farms. One of the changes that has spurred the sector has been the government decision to lift the cap on the size of projects eligible for subsidies via the feed-in tariff. The arrival in recent years of low-cost solar panels from China has also helped make Photovoltaic technology more competitive. The Foresight fund will float on the London Stock Exchange at 100p a share, and is targeting an initial dividend of 6p a share, which it then hopes to raise each year in line with the retail price index. Small investors can put as little as £1,000 into the fund, and can place their investment in a tax-free stock and shares Isa (maximum £11,520 in 2013-14) or a self-invested personal pension (SIPP). The dividend forecast is slightly lower than the Bluefield fund, which is targeting an initial 7p dividend per share. But there are clouds on the horizon, in the form of growing opposition to coating swaths of the British countryside in panels. A planning application for a £20m solar farm on a 38-hectare (94-acre) site in Tattingstone, Suffolk, was turned down in June , following a high-profile campaign by local opponents including the actor and comedian Griff Rhys Jones. There has been particular unease about new projects in Cornwall and the rest of the south-west. In August, Somerset MP and foreign minister Jeremy Browne described large-scale solar farms as a \"monstrous desecration\" of the countryside after plans for a 20-hectare site near Taunton were unveiled. But promoters of the funds say investors are protected because they are only buying existing schemes, or those that already have planning consent. In Spain, solar investors were burned after the government withdrew generous subsidies, and in Britain, financial advisers warn that investing in solar remains a risky prospect. Brian Dennehy of Dennehy Weller says: \"The solar industry has been through some big ups and downs over the years. The current flurry of offers is based on subsidies, improving margins, and better results from R&amp;D. Don't bet the house on this one, there are a lot of variables which can quickly undermine the improving outlook. Hopefully widows and orphans won't be sucked in by the headline dividend promise. It is this high to reflect the high risks.\" Justin Modray of Candid Money is also concerned about the withdrawal of subsidies. \"The idea is certainly appealing, but it's important not to ignore the potential risks. Opposition to solar parks is growing as they blight the landscape, which may hinder development. Nevertheless, provided Foresight can get its fund up and running by investing in existing developments, this should prove less of an issue. Changing weather patterns could affect production for better or worse and overall energy demand and supply will obviously affect returns. Since this is also a relatively new investment area, longer term returns and management expertise are, as yet, unproven. Plus, of course, the government may decide to reduce the attractiveness of renewable energy incentives.\" Foresight is not a name familiar to small investors, but it does have experience of running specialist investment funds, albeit with mixed success to date. The company launched a venture capital trust investing in solar energy in August 2010 at 100p per share, aiming to pay 5p of dividends a year after two years. \"So far it appears to meeting its goal, although the share price of around 103p is trading well below the net value of the fund's underlying assets of around 124p,\" says Modray. But at advisers BestInvest, Jason Hollands likes the Foresight fund –)) and recommends the Bluefield fund as well. \"From an investment perspective, what underpins the attractions of these vehicles is that they offer investors high dividend yields which typically have policies to rise in line with inflation and a proportion of their revenues are de facto guaranteed by subsidies. \"These should be seen as income investments which offer a high degree of predictability and some inflation proofing. Foresight is a well-respected venture capital house, which has established a strong presence in renewables. We feel this is an attractive launch.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"small-business-network/2013/oct/22/renewable-energy-power-business","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-22T08:15:17Z","webTitle":"Using renewable energies to power your business more efficiently","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/oct/22/renewable-energy-power-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/2013/oct/22/renewable-energy-power-business","fields":{"headline":"Using renewable energies to power your business more efficiently","bodyText":"There are very few questions facing an SME that could be considered 'no brainers', but investment in renewables is one. A business investing in renewables gets paid for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy it generates, even if it uses that energy. According to renewables consultancy Dulas, every kWh produced through renewables is roughly equivalent to a saving of half a tonne of greenhouse gases every year. James Cass, business development manager at Dulas, points out that most businesses are surprised to hear the good news about renewables, which makes them appear too good to be true. \"You can invest in solar or biomass to generate electricity or heat from a purely environmental standpoint because they're renewable and it's a great thing to do,\" he says. \"From the perspective of the bottom line, though, it's the simplest decision going. For electricity, you'll get paid 13p for every kWh of solar energy you produce, even if you use it. So you save at least that again on energy you're not buying from your provider. Then, say it's the weekend or a bank holiday, and you're producing but not using any, you can get just under 5p per kWh you export back from the national grid.\" It is a similar arrangement with biomass burners which create heat through burning pellets of wood taken from responsibly managed woodland. Through the Renewable Heat Incentive companies get paid just under 9p for every KwH of heat energy they produce for the first 1,314 hours of each year, and thereafter around 2p. Halving bills Paul Williams, production manager at Y Lolfa printing company, was left scratching his head when he heard about the deals, which are guaranteed for 20 years with automatic annual inflation increases. The printing and publishing company is a heavy electricity user and was looking for a way to reduce bills and be greener. \"We had a few meetings where we were looking for the catch,\" he recalls. \"We're very glad we went with it because we now produce about a quarter of our electricity needs from our solar panels. We get paid to produce it, even though we're using it, and we get the same saving again in power we're not having to buy. It's effectively halved our bills. \"The panels only need daylight to generate electricity, although the brighter the day, the more electricity they produce. They're forecasted to pay for themselves after seven years but we're guaranteed our feed-in tariff for 20. It's such a no brainer, we're having a biomass heating system put in as well.\" The decision was made all the easier for the company having had the £70,000 required for a 27 kWh array in the bank where it was earning virtually no interest. Invested in the roof, the capital is making a positive impact of around £13,000 per year in energy savings and energy income. Eco comfort Biomass has made a huge positive impact at the Battlesteads Hotel in Hexham, Northumberland. It had been reliant on electricity but now a new biomass boiler has reduced consumption by half and ensured rooms are warm and showers have piping hot water all day. \"People sometimes think that going green is about putting on an extra jumper and grinning and bearing it, but we're proof it can actually mean extra comfort,\" says hotel owner Richard Slade. \"We investigated green electricity but couldn't find a supplier who could meet all our needs so we had to look at alternative methods to ensure we could provide extra comfort while being carbon neutral. The wood pellets we use come from just a couple of miles down the road and they're responsibly grown so there's virtually no carbon impact. It's a lot cheaper to produce heat this way than through electricity, and we're paid to produce it.\" There are, of course, a couple of provisos to solar and biomass. SMEs need to own their building or have a long-term lease in place to get permission to put panels on the roof and to make the investment worthwhile. With biomass, companies need to be set up to receive deliveries of wood chips. Wind power shares the same advantages of being both green and earning a subsidy but for most SMEs it is only a theoretical option. Getting planning permission can be problematic and turbines need to be sited in windy areas, a good distance away from buildings. Hence, it is only a real alternative for businesses with many acres to spare and so, among SMEs, is typically the preserve of farmers. Gas power For those who cannot get access to a roof, such as the Anne Veck hairdressing salon in Oxford, there is an alternative that still qualifies for the government's feed-in tariff. Salon co-owner Keith Mellen has installed a BlueGen ceramic fuel cell device that turns natural gas into electricity. \"For businesses that don't have direct roof access it's a great device which is about the size of a fridge,\" he says. \"It means we get a guaranteed supply of electricity from our gas connection, which is a lot cheaper than electricity and also has a far lower carbon footprint, particularly when we switch to green gas next spring. \"The BlueGen is really clever because the heat it generates when working is used to heat our water, so we get a tank full of hot water free each day. We've been able to virtually eliminate our electricity bill through gas, which has cut our overall energy bill by 70% and we also get to greatly reduce our CO2 emissions.\" In fact, because the saloon has the fuel cell device on a lease, the financials are clear from day one and it is already proving cash positive to the tune of £2,300 per year. For biomass and solar power SMEs, there are two main financing choices. They can either use money in the bank and get a far better return, as well as a boost to their eco creditials, or they can apply for loans. Several banks are now offering loans for renewables and there is the Carbon Trust's Energy Efficiency Financial Scheme which offers low interest (zero interest in Wales) loans.

Not so fast, says Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, CEO of the Belgian chemicals giant, Solvay. Sustainability, he explains, is crucial to the long-term survival of chemical companies. Solvay, which turns 150 this year, has made crucial components in the new lithium car battery, which emits 30% less CO2 than regular car batteries, and even worked on flight across the US using only renewable fuel. Clamadieu claims Solvay can be CO2-neutral in five years. In a recent survey, 44% of chemicals company CEOs said it's very important to be a sustainability frontrunner. Do you agree, and if so, would you say Solvay is a frontrunner? With the world moving in the direction of more sustainability, a focus on sustainability offers many opportunities. Are we a frontrunner? I think so. Solvay has always been controlled by the same group of family shareholders, and our founder always took the position that a company should take its responsibility towards the environment and the community seriously. When I look at what we're doing today, this still applies. For example, 10% of our managers' bonuses is linked to their sustainability performance. So, if the average Belgian asked you what makes Solvay sustainable, what would you answer? I'd tell him that it's not just a PR ploy. We have a system that allows each of our plants to measure how we fare in 42 different areas that relate to our impact on the environment, for example water consumption and social relationships. And it's not just a commitment on my part, but one that goes really deep in the organisation. But you as the CEO also have a responsibility towards the company's owners. Can a chemical company be completely sustainable and still retain its value to its shareholders? Yes. In fact, if we want to create long-term value for shareholders, there's no other way than becoming sustainable. For chemical companies, if you don't take sustainability seriously, you may end up in a situation where you'll cancel out a lot of value to shareholders. When I visit one of our plants, I look at the sustainability performance of the plant – emissions, safety, water, and so on – and it's very much tied to the overall performance of the plant. I don't see sustainability and value creation as being in opposition to each other. In the very short term, perhaps, but if you take a medium or long-term view, sustainability and value are aligned. What's the most important step a chemicals company can take towards greater sustainability? Replace petroleum? That would be quite ambitious! Replacing petroleum is probably impossible, and in some case would be counter-productive, but choosing more and more renewable is the direction we need to go. And every decision at every level of the company should take into account its impact on the environment in a wider sense. So, when you have discussions with your board or managers, sustainability is always included? In the chemical industry, you can't make a decision – for example, to build a new plant – without taking sustainability into account. Regulations are very complex, emissions are controlled in one way or another, for example through the carbon market in Europe. But when you're working on an innovation project that you'll put on the market within the next two years or so, sustainability is a crucial factor that helps us decide which project to invest large amounts of money in. When we make strategic decisions, we always look at what the sustainability profile of the new product or plant will be. It's not just nice words: it's a whole methodology. And think of negotiations with unions. We're about to sign an agreement with the global union that represents chemical workers, and sustainability needs to be embedded there, too. It's not just about CO2 emissions. Your products form the basis of lithium car batteries, which can limit CO2 emissions by 30%. How much do you expect this market to grow? What we do is produce the key components that can help develop car batteries that can last longer and be loaded much faster. This will determine the success of electric vehicles. We expect the lithium battery market to grow by 30% per year during the next five years, but it can definitely be higher than that. Electric vehicles have been rather slow in taking off, but there are some new models that can change the game. Are there any particular cars you think will become successes? Because we're supplying almost all the manufacturers, I don't want to play favourites. But the new BMW i3 is quite interesting. It's the first car that has been made as an electric vehicle from the start. Will there ever be such a thing as a clean or even CO2-neutral chemicals company? There was a study made by the chemical industry a couple of years ago that shows that the chemical industry will be able to save five times as much in CO2 emissions as it generates. It's obviously a very complex calculation, because it's not just us making the emissions that result from our products, but when I look at our innovation pipeline, I believe we can certainly become carbon-neutral. And I think Solvay can become one of the first CO2-neutral chemical companies. What kind of timeframe are we talking about? I think having a carbon-neutral footprint within five years is feasible. And we've been working on this for some time. Ten years ago, we were the first company to become a partner in the Solar Impulse project. Recently this airplane flew from San Francisco to New York, purely on solar energy. No less than 6,000 Solvay parts were used on this plane. That's a very good illustration of how something that at first seemed impossible – flying without a drop of kerosene – can become a reality. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

In 2043, the fossil fuel age is over: nuclear power stations ar e melting down, there is no access to the electricity grid and solar panels are so prized that they are looted. Catastrophic climate change has become a reality. Rising sea levels have caused floods on the New York City subway, killing thousands. Internet coverage is patchy, food and consumer goods are scarce, and life‑saving drugs such as insulin are hard to come by. It is a dystopian vision that looks like a brutal, dangerous version of the past – one not at all like the future that was promised when the cold war ended with victory for the western capitalist model. If it comes to pass, it will be because, despite all the warnings, climate change has not been taken seriously enough. Here is one such warning: “For generations, we have assumed that the efforts of mankind would leave the fundamental equilibrium of the world’s systems and atmosphere stable. But it is possible that with all these enormous changes – population, agricultural, use of fossil fuels – concentrated into such a short period of time, we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself.” That was Margaret Thatcher, in a speech to Britain’s scientific elite in 1988. Thatcher was no climate change denier. She told the Royal Society that her government supported the idea of sustainable economic development, and concluded: “Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world, provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded. Protecting this balance of nature is therefore one of the great challenges of the late 20th century.” It was, though, just one speech at a time of great global upheaval: China was liberalising its economy; apartheid was in its death throes in South Africa; above all, the cold war was coming to an end with defeat for the Soviet Union. “We know what works,” US president George HW Bush said at the time. “Free markets work.” The market model spread quickly to parts of the world that previously it could not touch: to China, where the reforms begun by Deng Xiaoping were accelerated; to India, where the idea that the world’s biggest democracy could go it alone was abandoned; to the Soviet Union and its former satellites, which received a strong dose of economic shock treatment. Within five years, the reach of the market economy had been extended to an additional 3 billion people. Some places remained off limits. Cuba, subject to a US economic embargo, was one such country. After decades of relying on Moscow for oil, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and a large chunk of its food, Fidel Castro’s government faced a crisis. The economy shrank and strict food rationing was imposed. There was an acute shortage of fuel for tractors. Calorie intake fell by a third. The Cuban government responded by creating urban farms: agriculture went local, small scale and – by necessity – organic. Food production became less oil-intensive, as every possible scrap of land was exploited. If the denouement of Mitchell’s novel presents one frightening future, Cuba provides another sketch of what could be in store if the transition from a fossil fuel world to one running on renewable energy does not go according to plan – less apocalyptic than The Bone Clocks, but with considerable drawbacks. The grow-your-own drive has only been partially successful: a quarter of a century later, food is still rationed in Cuba. Most of the world has gone in a different direction. In the west, there was a long economic boom that lasted from the early 1990s through to the financial crash of 2007. Growth rates in the developed world, however, were dwarfed by those in some of the bigger emerging economies. After the crash, when the developed world was struggling to emerge from the deepest slump since the Great Depression, it was China and India that acted as the engines of growth. In terms of reducing the number of people living below the global poverty line of $1.25 (84p) a day, the post-cold war model of capitalism has been a success. Fewer people go hungry. More have access to healthcare and education. The size of the global middle class has increased, and consumers in Shanghai and Mumbai have been able to afford cars and fridge-freezers. But this process has had two unattractive side effects. The first is that the balance of power in the workplace has tilted decisively in favour of capital over labour: with an abundance of cheap workers to choose from, employers can be mean with pay. The second is that the triumph of the market has put pressure on the planet, just as Thatcher suspected it might. As the west outsourced its manufacturing to low-cost centres in Asia, energy demand in China, India and Indonesia rocketed. Globalisation means that people in the developing world know how we live in the west and they want some of what we have. In addition to higher consumer spending, that also means higher demand for energy, the bulk of which comes from fossil fuels. China currently builds a new coal-fired power station every two weeks. Burning fossil fuels puts carbon into the atmosphere, and the overwhelming view of scientists is that this leads to a buildup of greenhouse gases that results in global warming. To have a realistic prospect of preventing global temperatures from rising by more than the previously recognised danger threshold of 2C, scientists say it is not possible to burn all the proven fossil fuel reserves owned by companies and governments. Between two-thirds and four-fifths will need to be left in the ground. The question, therefore, is whether it is possible to marry two seemingly contradictory objectives. Can we imagine a future that is cleaner, greener and sustainable – one that avoids climate armageddon – without abandoning the idea of growth and, thus, forcing living standards into decline? The answer is that it will be hellishly difficult, but it is just about feasible if we make the right choices – and start making them now. * * * Slowly, those in power are beginning to understand what is at stake: that if we carry on growing the global economy at its current rate, and continue to rely on fossil fuels to power that growth, the planet is going to cook. Not everybody buys into this narrative, of course. One of the challenges faced by those who wish to curtail fossil fuel use is that there is no political consensus on tackling climate change. The business-as-usual camp says that the scientific consensus is wrong about climate change, or that climate scientists have exaggerated the risks, which can be tackled if and when they become apparent. But Barack Obama does not think that way, and nor does China’s president, Xi Jinping, which is why they signed a deal in November 2014 setting targets for CO2 emissions up to 2030. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, does not believe it either, which is why he went public at the 2014 annual meeting of the World Bank with his view that the “vast majority of fossil fuel reserves are unburnable” if we wish to keep the increase in global temperatures below 2C. With the world barely recovered from one global recession, policymakers are now concerned about another. The talk at meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the G20 is whether the next financial crash will be caused by the pricking of the carbon bubble – the idea that the stock-market valuation of fossil fuel companies has been inflated by overestimating the worth of reserves of oil, coal and gas that could only be exploited by putting the climate at risk. In the unlikely event that investors all pulled out of fossil fuels at once, the result would be much worse than what followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 – a colossal stock market crash, followed by an equally epic slump. The Bank of England is sufficiently concerned to have launched an investigation into the risks of this happening. The odds are still against such a financial market meltdown. In part, that is because investors will probably move slowly. In part, it is because the reserves of the big western fossil fuel companies make up only a small chunk of the global total, and it is hard to see Vladimir Putin being too troubled by a divestment campaign. But the risk is now out there – and growing – because policymakers have now woken up to the risks of climate change. “There have been two terrible realisations,” says Michael Jacobs, who used to advise Gordon Brown on the issue. “We have started too late, and it doesn’t matter how much solar and wind power there is – you are still burning all the coal, oil and gas. Even if you do so more slowly, it will still go into the atmosphere and cause climate change.” Jacobs adds that, in the past quarter of a century, when countries could have been putting in place the infrastructure for a new green economy, they have been going in the opposite direction. They have invested in fossil fuel-burning power plants and built energy‑inefficient buildings in cities designed for cars. Carney believes climate change is the medium-term issue of our age, but talks about the “tragedy of horizons”. By this he means that central banks and finance ministers are set up to deal with short-term problems, such as whether inflation will hit its target in two or three years’ time, or whether another housing bubble can be prevented before the end of the decade. Governments are thinking about climate change, but they have other more immediate priorities: reducing unemployment, increasing living standards and, in the case of politicians rather than the technocrats running central banks, getting re-elected. To some in the environmental movement – the “deep greens” – it seems pointless to expect politicians to do anything meaningful about climate change: they are obsessed with growth for its own sake, bend the knee to fossil fuel companies when they demand tax breaks and subsidies, and are reluctant to back the potential of renewables. In order to avoid ecological suicide, they argue, we must first recognise that capitalism is an insuperable obstacle to any reduction in our fossil fuel consumption. All of this may be true, but it leaves unanswered the question of how we get from where we are now to the kind of world the deep greens want to see. Let us begin with one basic idea: 250 years of growth based on the exploitation of fossil fuels has brought real benefits. There are those who might argue otherwise, but life in the world before the industrial revolution really was nasty, brutish and short. Life expectancy was 40 at best, the working week was long, disease was rife and diets were poor. Life for the vast bulk of the population was strictly no-frills, as it had been for more than a millennium. The current coalition government in the UK has come under attack for allowing the economy to flatline for a couple of years, but incomes per head barely rose in the 1,300 years between the sacking of Rome and the mid‑18th century. The acceleration of growth and big increases in living standards only really began with the industrial revolution; they would not have happened without the exploitation of fossil fuels. Over the years, the idea that all growth is good became embedded. Parents expected their children to be better off than they were. Businesses that did not expand were viewed as failures. One four-letter word underpinned economics: more. And this, notwithstanding the corporate sustainability reports and the greenwashing, remains the case for even the most right-on companies. Unilever wants to sell more soap and deodorant. John Lewis commissions expensive ads to encourages us all to spend more at Christmas. Here at the Guardian, we want to sell more newspapers, and more ads to companies selling their own goods and services to readers. But the economics of more, together with a rapidly rising population, have created problems unforeseen at the time of James Watt’s steam engine. At the end of the 18th century there were fewer than 1 billion people on the planet. Today there are more than 7 billion. The energy needs of a bigger and richer global population have risen sixfold in the past 50 years. Almost 90% of that energy is provided by fossil fuels – coal, gas and oil. Global temperatures have risen by almost 1C above pre-industrial levels, and the number of weather-related natural disasters has increased. Those who say manmade global warming isn’t happening look more and more certain to end up on the wrong side of history – which will harshly judge our failure to act until the threat had become so obvious that we had no other options. * * * There are more climate change sceptics than we might like to think. But the problem goes much further than figures such as Tony Abbott, the prime minister of Australia, or Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, or about every Republican harbouring hopes of winning the nomination for the 2016 US presidential race. That problem is us. Dieter Helm, professor of energy studies at Oxford University, says: “It’s not clear we’re very serious about climate change. We want other people to do stuff, we want to divest from companies – but what about us? We are ultimately the consumers of those carbon-based products, and when we elect politicians, what’s worrying is that we’re not prepared to say: ‘Make us pay for the damage and the pollution we cause.’” This is an uncomfortable thought. If climate change can simply be blamed on “the Man”, on the evils of capitalism, or on a cabal of fossil fuel companies hell-bent on destroying the planet, then the solution is to take on the Man, replace capitalism with something kinder and gentler, and force the fossil fuel companies to shut down. But if it can be blamed on “us”, the answer is not quite so simple. Fossil fuels are used to make and power mobile phones, tablets and laptops. There is no evidence that we want fewer of them. Nor would there be much support for a return to the days before fridges, gas cookers, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Smoking in a restaurant or bar is no longer socially acceptable; until the same applies to driving your son or daughter to school in a gas-guzzling 4x4, Helm is right: we are not very serious about climate change. This is one of the reasons why the deep-green approach to climate change is fraught with difficulty. The fossil fuel companies are in business because we want the products that fossil fuels make and power. It is not just a question of supply, but also a question of demand, which is why many people now have more than one smartphone and lust after the Apple watch. Does this make us any happier? Well, according to Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, economists at the University of Michigan in the US, the evidence is that wellbeing rises with income, and that the satiation point has yet to be reached, even in the richest countries. The experience of the past few years would appear to support the Stevenson-Wolfers argument: the idea that, above a certain level of prosperity, there is no link between happiness and income has yet to be tested in a period when living standards have been flatlining. But there is little evidence so far that the public is wildly keen on the idea that they are becoming worse off. The second problem with the deep-green approach is that even assuming rich people in the west could be persuaded to curb their consumption, it would not stop CO2 emissions from rising. That is because the real growth in energy demand from now on is going to come from the developing world. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are home to around 630 million people with no electricity. Apart from the impact on households, power shortages are holding back growth and job creation. Firms have to depend on costly generators, which makes goods more expensive. Outside of South Africa, coal is a small part of the power story. Africa is far greener than the UK, the US or Germany, largely because of hydroelectric power in countries such as Ethiopia. Its carbon footprint is tiny. Again leaving South Africa to one side, the average person in sub-Saharan Africa consumes the same amount of energy in a month as the average Briton does in a day, according to Kevin Watkins, director of the UK’s Overseas Development Institute. Without question, Africa’s energy consumption is going to rise. It has abundant reserves of coal – the most damaging of the fossil fuels – and nations such as Angola and Nigeria are significant oil exporters. One option would be to skip fossil fuels entirely and move straight to renewables, especially solar energy, but Watkins says that this is too expensive for most countries to contemplate. “Achieving universal access and a tenfold increase in power generation will take huge domestic investments and a big international financing effort.” So, there is a choice. The rest of the world can help poor African countries with the cost of developing renewable energy; the rest of the world can provide Africa with expensive carbon capture and storage for coal-fired power stations; or the rest of the world can do nothing and watch Africa’s carbon footprint rise rapidly as it burns dirty fossil fuels. There is no status quo option. India provides another example of the policy choices facing countries in the emerging world. Given the dreadful air quality in Delhi, the government led by Narendra Modi is well aware of the threat of climate change and has announced ambitious plans to increase solar power. But it also wants to ensure that every Indian citizen has access to electricity, and believes that can only be achieved by expanding coal power at the same time as it is expanding solar power. Watkins believes western governments and environmental NGOs would be better off mobilising finance for a programme of carbon capture and storage in India than offering Modi advice about the perils of climate change. The third difficulty with the anti-growth approach is that growth is part of the solution to climate change. Most growth is the result of innovation – the development of new products, new techniques and new ways of doing things that are an improvement on what went before. Since the middle of the 18th century, there have been successive waves of technical progress: coal and steam, railways and the internal combustion engine at the end of the 19th century; the mid-20th-century age of consumer durables and commercial air travel. The next wave looks like it will be dominated by digital technology, robotics, biotech, lighter materials and renewable energy. Nicholas Stern, who authored a 2006 report on the economics of climate change commissioned by then-chancellor Gordon Brown, says stopping growth misses the point. The possibilities opened up by this new wave of technology, he believes, provide hope that growth can be decarbonised over the decades to come. “To say that we have to stop growing – that we have to go backwards – I think is factually wrong, and also politically unlikely to be successful.” Even if the world called a halt to economic expansion now, he adds, carbon emissions would continue rising and the world would be looking at an increase in global temperatures of 3-4C. “We absolutely can have growth and protection of the climate at the same time, and in doing so we will construct a much better form of economic activity and growth in terms of clean air, less-congested cities and so on,” Stern says. “If we say the only way to handle this is to stop growing, we will be factually wrong, because if we stopped growing but didn’t break the relationship between activity and emissions, we wouldn’t be tackling climate change.” In reality, only the deepest greens are opposed to all forms of growth. The Green party in the UK wants to grow the NHS and education; it wants a bigger budget for social care and a higher minimum wage. Tim Jackson of the University of Surrey, author of Prosperity Without Growth, says we need fewer resource-intensive activities that damage the climate, but more of the services that improve the quality of people’s lives. Like Stern, he is not really talking about replacing the economics of “more” with the economics of “less”; he is suggesting replacing it with the economics of “better”. There are only three ways of reducing our carbon footprint: reduce the amount each person consumes, reduce the number of people, or make each unit of growth less carbon-intensive. Those who want to cut consumption and restrict population growth have the same question to answer: unless you are prepared to use draconian methods, how do you do it? Historical evidence shows there is a link between income and population: as people become richer, they have fewer children. That is why Japan’s population is ageing and shrinking. So if reducing living standards is a political non-starter and repression is spurned as a way of controlling population growth, that leaves reducing the carbon-intensity of growth. “I think it’s extremely simplistic to be pro-growth or anti-growth”, says Helm. “What matters is the sort of growth we choose. Now the underlying driver of economic growth is technical change, and technical change is accelerating. We want technical change, for example, to build new solar technologies. Do the deep greens say, ‘Tell you what, we want to stop the boat now, we don’t want to bother with any more technical change, let’s go back to a more simple society, a more decentralised society, and one that has a smaller footprint on the planet’? I think that’s totally naive.” * * * Even the light green approach is going to be tough, and might not work. The UN is hosting a conference in Paris in late 2015 that will seek commitments to reduce carbon emissions from all the countries attending. As things stand, the offers will fall a long way short of what the experts say is a level consistent with the 2C target – about 12bn tonnes a year, short according to Michael Jacobs. The fossil fuel company BP helpfully provided a ready reckoner in its latest Energy Outlook report for how 2bn tonnes of CO2 emissions could be saved by 2035. It would involve the share of gas used in power generation rising from just over 20% to more than 35%; coal with carbon capture and storage rising from almost zero to just under 10%; renewables increasing from around 5% to just over 20%; and finally, nuclear power almost doubling from just under 10%. The same 2bn tonnes of CO2 could be saved through substantial improvements in energy-efficiency over and above those already expected. Oil, coal and gas currently account for 86% of primary energy, and BP is forecasting only a small decrease, to 81%, by 2035. That is incompatible with the climate change projections made by the International Energy Agency, which thinks fossil fuels should make up no more than two-thirds of the energy mix. BP admits that, on its current projections, emissions will “remain well above the path recommended by scientists”. The IEA also makes the point that it is time the world got its act together. “Delaying action is a false economy: for every $1 of investment in cleaner technology that is avoided in the power sector before 2020, an additional $4.30 would need to be spent after 2020 to compensate for the increased emissions.” Fossil fuels are not going to disappear overnight, but the phasing-out process needs to start immediately, and that process could be hastened if governments used the opportunity provided by the recent halving of global oil prices to remove the $1tn annual subsidies for fossil fuels. It is easy to see why governments, especially those in poorer parts of the world, want to help citizens with their energy bills. But the collapsing cost of crude oil is the equivalent of a tax cut for energy consumers; governments could remove subsidies painlessly in the current climate. The IEA is right: further delay will be costly. Obama could do his bit by making climate change a mission for the US – similar to the way that John F Kennedy vowed to put a man on the moon in the early 1960s. The mission could be to phase out domestic use and export of coal by a fixed date, or to set a deadline for shifting 50% of US energy consumption to renewable sources. Washington could then invite other nations to sign on to the same commitment. That message would be reinforced by putting a price on carbon. This could be achieved in one of two ways: through a carbon tax, or through a cap-and-trade scheme. Either way, it would suggest that governments had started to take seriously what Stern calls one of the greatest market failures in history: the failure to take account of the damage caused by burning fossil fuels. Once shareholders understand that governments are serious about climate change, they will start to look at their investment portfolios. New technologies, particularly those with first‑mover advantage, tend to be profitable, and there will be incentives for pension funds and insurance companies to get their money out of the fossil fuel sector and into a sector that has massive growth potential. On past form, governments will be slower to act than they should be. The lessons from the anti-apartheid and debt-relief campaigns is that divestment can be used to put pressure on governments to act. Politicians move when they know votes are at risk. There are not many votes to be won these days by promising to increase foreign aid, but taxpayers in the west have to realise that poor countries with copious reserves of fossil fuels are going to exploit them, and that one way of mitigating the impact is to transfer to them the latest technology. The exploitation of fossil fuels in the developing world is only going to be reduced if financial assistance is offered. The amount of money currently allocated by international bodies, such as the UN, for climate change adaptation and mitigation is less than $1bn a year: it needs to be at least 10 times bigger. Unless it is, there will be little point in saying that someone in sub-Saharan Africa can get all the power he or she needs via a solar panel costing as little as $200. After all, the average sub-Saharan African does not have $200 to spare. Success at the Paris conference would be easier if developing countries saw that the west was serious about providing help for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Jacobs says there is little prospect of countries hardening up their commitments between now and December, but it would be progress if there were agreements to tackle particularly damaging forms of climate change, such as deforestation, and to cut emissions to zero in the second half of the century. But that does not mean that we can afford to wait until the second half of the century to make the transition to non‑fossil-fuel energy. Building up the necessary infrastructure is going to be a long and expensive process, which should be encouraged through public procurement, tax incentives and a big increase in R&amp;D budgets. The stone age did not end because of a shortage of stone. The fossil fuel age will end either when there are newer, better and cleaner ways of providing energy, or when it is too late to prevent irreparable damage to the planet. Renewable technology is moving on apace. Investment in clean energy is growing at a double-digit rate. That is the good news. The bad news is that renewables will still only meet around 20% of energy demand by 2035, even using optimistic assumptions about future growth rates. That is going to require some tough decisions and some compromises. Coal is by far the dirtiest of the fossil fuels; it needs to be phased out first, and rapidly. But there is going to be a lag, even on the most optimistic assumptions, before renewables can take the place of coal. “We’re seeing very rapid change”, says Stern, “but we’re going to have to accelerate the arrival and installation and use of renewables, from hydroelectricity and wave power through to the various types of solar. We’re going to have to look more closely at carbon capture and storage, because that’s a way of using your fossil fuels without emitting. And we’re going to have a period when gas is substituted for coal.” Helm agrees. “It’s pretty obvious that we can’t both burn fossil fuels and limit the damage from climate change. There are basically three steps toward getting out of fossil fuels. The first is to make people pay for the consequences of burning fossil fuels, and that’s a carbon tax. The second is the transitionary bit: the only serious way in the next 15-20 years to bear down on coal is to switch from coal to gas. Gas is, of course, a fossil fuel, but it has half the emissions of coal, and we could make substantive cuts – as indeed the US has done – by making the switch. And then, further out, what we need are new technologies.” So what will the world look like in 2043? The future sketched out in The Bone Clocks is only fiction. It does not have to be that way. We could be living through the green technological revolution, in which energy has been decarbonised. Atlanta and Barcelona have the same number of people and share the same per-capita incomes, but Atlanta’s carbon emissions are 10 times those of Barcelona. We need more Barcelonas and fewer Atlantas, because that will encourage us to change the way we live: walking more, using public transport more, sharing cars, cycling. All of this is important, because ultimately Helm is right. This is not just about carbon taxes. It is not just about R&amp;D. It is not just about divestment. If we really want the fossil fuels to be left in the ground, it is about us. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/jun/03/sustainable-brands-live-from-san-diego","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-06T21:47:11Z","webTitle":"Sustainable Brands in San Diego - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/03/sustainable-brands-live-from-san-diego","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/03/sustainable-brands-live-from-san-diego","fields":{"headline":"Sustainable Brands in San Diego - as it happened","bodyText":"Feelings came up far more often than might be expected at a business conference, many attendees remarked. At a Tuesday session on “Changing the Game”, for example, panelists discussed the role of grief and pain in climate-change denial. “[People think] 'I’m just not convinced climate change is real because I can’t believe what I drive is going to kill us'”, said Andrew Winston, founder of Winston Eco-Strategies and a Guardian Sustainable Business contributor. “But that attitude is a little like my kids’. I think part of being an adult is taking responsibility.” That said, there are signs the “denial phase” may be coming to an end, he said. In a secret-ballot poll of top executives, a high percentage called climate change either an existential threat or a big problem, he added: “I was shocked.” My Guardian colleague Jo Confino said it’s important to acknowledge the deep emotions involved in sustainability challenges: If we were all to really deeply get into the issues we’re facing, there’s an enormous amount of hidden grief about what is happening in the world. What we’re creating is killing species in the world…. We like to come up with solutions and strategy, which is critically important, but it’s also all about feeling – feeling on a deep level. We need to have more tears. Changing the world starts with transforming ourselves, he said. “There’s something around being really honest with ourselves,” he said. “I went to breakfast the first day of the conference and I went in telling myself, I’m going to have granola, and ended up with bacon and eggs. The next day, I went to breakfast [again intending to have granola] and had pancakes. I’m exhorting everyone to change the way they live … I can’t even change my breakfast.” Renee Lertzman, director of insight at Brand Cool, applauded the discussion about feelings. “It’s the first time I’m seeing people talk about this,” she said. “I’m seeing more of an appetite for hearing about the relationship between our inner work and our outer work – how we relate to ourselves and recognizing how that relates to our work in the world. I’m hearing a more emotional vocabulary. I’m hearing talk about empathy, compassion, grief. ” Lertzman said she’d like to see more discussion about the relationship between emotions and sustainability. “We have to start with ourselves and our efficacy is contingent on that,” she said. Pamela Wilhelms, founder of Wilhelms Consulting, also said she’s seeing a change toward more spirituality. “The conversation around the spiritual dimension is happening,” she said. “For years before, there was very little talk about this. There’s much more of a conversation about it now; it’s a spiritual shift.” Carrie Majeske, associate director of global sustainability integration at Ford, agreed. Mindfulness is “coming at me from everywhere” lately, she said, and not just from other sustainability professionals. It hits here especially hard because of the big picture view in the social and environmental community, but it’s gaining traction everywhere. With all the data coming at us, everyone needs to find time to quiet your mind and reflect. We’re so connected and there’s a gap between what we can handle and what we think we can handle. I think we’ve hit a tipping point with connectedness leading to overwhelmedness. For Majeske’s #GSBselfie, she committed to pushing for mindfulness training at work. -JK The need for more data and metrics to tie sustainability to reality – and to business value – came up constantly at the event. As Jeff Gowdy, who spoke on a panel about science-based goal setting, said “I’ve been surprised to see this thread of science-based context everywhere I go – in plenaries and conversations – at Sustainable Brands. It seems to be an identifiable horizon everyone can see. We know we need to get there, even if we don’t know how. Everyone’s talking about it.” Mission Measurement Corp CEO Jason Saul gave a plenary talk about new tools to tie social value to sales Tuesday. And Gwen Migita, vice president of sustainability and community affairs at Caesars Entertainment, told me her company – working with Bea Boccalandro at VeraWorks – has conducted a study to put a dollar value on its social impact. The research found that Caesars produces $4.2m a year of social value – including taxes, volunteer time, etc – for every $10m of revenue it generates, compared to an average, for US companies, of approximately $2m a year. “Now we’ve got a more quantitative way to justify our license to operate,” Migita said. Caesars also is working to come up with “more well-rounded societal metrics” to use in discussing issues like employee wellness in the company, and evaluating whether it would make sense to talk more about its corporate citizenship efforts with consumers, she said. “We’ve been heavily inward-focused until now,” Migita said, using corporate citizenship to advance employee engagement instead of marketing. Meanwhile, Amy Hargroves, director of corporate responsibility and sustainability at Sprint, said her team is working to show the value of CSR through added revenue from new products – mostly software and add-ons – in areas such as healthcare, education and poverty. If we can prove we can bring incremental revenue to our company through CR innovation, it can help clarify the business case for CSR,” she said. “We’re already proving the cost savings on the environmental side: We’re calculating the exact savings in energy and water and putting it right into our CR report. How do we do the same thing on revenue? She said more data is needed to bring the benefits of sustainability to life. “You can only go so long talking soft, which is reputational – what I call apple pie stuff,” she said. “We need to get harder. Clinton Moloney, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCooper, said it’s been encouraging to hear a clear call for better metrics during several panels. “I think it’s a call for all of us in this space to up our game,” he said. “We’re already converted; we need to talk to others, and metrics are a key to doing that.“ - JK To bring sustainable products mainstream, companies need to look beyond advocates – or so-called green consumers – which make up 21% of the market, according to the 2014 Aspirational Consumer Index by BBMG and GlobeScan. The focus is shifting to another hipper and more influential group, which BBMG and GlobeScan dub “aspirationals”. According to “The New Sustainability Narrative,” a new report released by the Rainforest Alliance, BBMG and Domtar at Sustainable Brands on Wednesday, aspirationals make up 38% of consumers. To attract them, companies need to do a better job of communicating sustainability on a human scale and helping to connect it to the universal aspiration to live a meaningful and happy life, said Raphael Bemporad, co-founder and chief strategy officer at BBMG. “Sustainability doesn’t mean anything real to consumers,” he said. “Too often, it brings to mind technical issues or seemingly insurmountable environmental challenges.” That’s a huge missed opportunity, he added. “Something very profound is happening in culture and, like never before, consumers are telling us they want to live more meaningfully and support brands that will help them get there.” In a BuzzBack study in which consumers were asked to assemble collages about what comes to mind when they think of sustainability, respondents connected it with clean energy, energy efficiency and nature, but didn’t connect it to their own wellbeing or success, Bemporad said. To change that, companies must link sustainability with its impact on consumers, as well as their families, communities and planet, he added. “To remain relevant, brands must evolve to compete not just on functional and emotional benefits, but also social and cultural benefits.” As Tom LaForge, global director of human and cultural insights at Coca-Cola, put it: “We’ve all crowded into the same spaces. The 73% of brands that could go away [without consumers caring, according to Havas’ Meaningful Brands study] are not bad brands, but others could fill in that space. … By adding that social level, you become a breakaway brand.” We’ve been talking about sustainability as an “it” when we really want to be talking about it as “me” and “us”, he said. -JK So far, the push towards science-based goals has mostly focused on tying companies’ environmental goals – such as emissions targets – to climate research such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. But as more companies add social initiatives to their sustainability efforts, some companies are wondering how to apply science to the creation of social goals too. “Social is always the hardest,” said Jeff Gowdy, founder of J Gowdy Consulting and an adjunct professor at Vanderbilt University, after a session on science-based goals Wednesday. “Environment is easy – we can measure water, waste.” That said, he added, reality – and common sense – can help set the threshold for those social goals. “If you have a goal around gender diversity on the board, a reality is most populations are around 50-50 (or 51-49),” he said. “It’s not hard science; it’s just a reality.” If you’re looking to reduce injuries, he said, “why would you ever set a goal above zero”? Also, top companies have already demonstrated the ability to get to zero waste without lower revenue, making “zero waste” what he calls a “reality-based goal”. “That’s the threshold, that’s achievable – we’re not putting a man on the moon,” he said. Amy Hargroves, director of corporate responsibility and sustainability at Sprint, said she’d like to emulate Unilever and Johnson &amp; Johnson on social impact. “You can look at the number of people your health initiatives impact, the number of people your education initiative impact and how that them impacts those people down the line,” she said. “But it really is a lot harder; it’s really challenging. … [Measuring social impact] is the standard for nonprofits, but new to business.” -JK Something that keeps coming up in various conversations and sessions at Sustainable Brands is an anecdote from Rick Ridgeway, Patagonia’s vice president of environmental initiatives, at a session on Tuesday. During the conference, he said, he was hungry and in a rush, and the restaurant was very crowded, so he picked up a plate of food that had someone else had left over and ate that. I was inspired by the story. I went to the restaurant and it was busy and I didn’t do that. What’s different between us is that he gave himself permission to do that and I didn’t. Everything we do in our life is based on our own permission to ourselves. Obviously there’s the permission of the organizations we work with, the government – all the regulations – but the most important is the permission we give ourselves. One key to a more sustainable future will be to break the limitations that we set on ourselves because of social norms. -JC SustainAbility's Mark Lee's sustainability pledge for the future: After participating in a panel on the path to zero deforestation Tuesday, Tensie Whelan, president of the Rainforest Alliance, said it was clear many in the audience came away confused by the term “zero deforestation”. \"A lot of people came up to me afterward and said: ‘What was that all about? It sounds like it’s not zero deforestation at all.’ No, it’s not. … We need to be careful that people understand ‘zero deforestation’ can mean many things, but it generally doesn’t mean zero deforestation.” It can mean setting aside certain high-concentration sections of the forest, minimizing impact on indigenous communities and sustainable management of the forest, she explained. It can mean net zero deforestation, or offsetting logging by replanting. It also can mean no logging of natural forests, which isn’t fair to local communities who benefit from those resources. In other words, forestry is complicated, and ending deforestation isn’t as simple as just replacing one tree with another. “It’s not just any trees, but what kind and where. It shouldn’t all be plantations, because there are communities that the forest benefits,” Whelan said. “There’s a complexity of issues you need to understand. You need to understand what you’re trying to reforest, what’s being logged and what’s being set aside in high-concentration forests and how you’re monitoring impact on indigenous people.” It all comes down to details – and definition. “The goal of zero deforestation is laudable,” Whelan said. “But any contribution to the goal needs to be clear in its definitions and targets. … People were using ‘zero deforestation to mean everything.” Maybe it’s also time for clearer vocabulary. “The terminology is bothersome,” Whelan said. “If we make it sound like something it’s not, sooner or later we’re going to run into problems.” - JK Gwen Migita, VP of sustainability and community engagement at Caesars Entertainment has her peers in her sights: Where does cradle-to-cradle fit into the vicious cycle of fashion that is constantly turning over and creating waste? “It’s an industry that for 200 years has raced to the bottom,” said Scott Mackinlay Hahn, co-founder and CEO of Loomstate at the Sustainable Brands Conference on Wednesday. He pointed to poor manufacturing practices, harmful chemicals and other social and environmental issues. Only about 15% of clothing is recycled and the other 85% is thrown away, he said. “It’s a big failure.” While more clothing collection points are needed, recycling is only part of the problem. The very thing that fashion is based on – uniqueness – must be challenged in new ways. “People don’t want to be all about the same story,” said Hahn. “Designers want to express themselves in a unique way.” Creating a brand that embraces cradle-to-cradle methods can actually empower that uniqueness and make designers stand out, he said. Loomstate is working with Chipotle to sustainably make and manufacture all of its uniforms. The organic cotton is grown and collected using sustainable agricultural processes and leftover cottonseeds from clothing manufacturing are used to feed the dairy cows that make the cheese for Chipotle burritos. Design schools need to build cradle-to-cradle concepts into their programs and teach students chemistry and the vocabulary of sustainability, he said. “Educating designers is the elephant in the room,” Hahn said. He echoed what Paul Dillinger, head of global product innovation at Levi Strauss, said earlier in the day when he challenged designers to rethink their design processes. “I, as a designer, made the problem; I made the mess,” Dillinger said. “If we can think about ways of designing without making messes we will be ahead.” - RP From Amy Hargroves, director of corporate responsibility and sustainability at Sprint: BuzzWord's Leah Haygood pledges to make some more friends: A selfie from Ford's associate director of sustainability integration Carrie Majeske: NRG Energy wants to put solar panels on all NFL stadiums, said Sicily Dickenson, chief marketing officer of NRG Energy at the Sustainable Brands conference. The company has outfitted six NFL stadiums, including the NRG Stadium in Houston, with solar energy so far. NRG Energy wanted everyday people to witness solar energy in use, said Dickenson. “We’re one of the biggest polluters in the US,” she openly told conference attendees. “But we want to change that.” Another company has made inroads into stadiums. BASF is sponsoring Sustainable Gamedays, including zero waste, compostable bags and recycling programs at a number of professional and college sports teams including the Seattle Mariners, University of Colorado and University of Texas. “We told the president of the Mariners, that we’re not sponsoring your team, but your zero waste program,” said Chris Bradlee, biopolymers market development manager at BASF North America. In part, it’s about educating sports teams that some of their programs that are traditionally viewed as costs, like a zero waste program or a recycling program, can now be seen as sellable assets, he said. Bradlee points out that game days create a lot of waste, but also provide a great opportunity to change behavior. BASF uses sponsored game days to help educate fans on how to compost and recycle. The sports industry is a “ripe territory” and can serve as a “platform for change,” said Citizen Group’s founder and executive creative director Robin Raj. “It’s bigger than the NFL, NBA, soccer, baseball—it’s about reaching communities.” Raj pointed to the Game Changer (pdf) report by NRDC’s senior scientist Allen Hershkowitz, who was also at the conference, that studies how the professional sports industry is leveraging its influence in hometowns to lead ecological stewardship. On the whole, it’s still a new field. “These programs are not well tested and need to be amplified,” Raj said. “We don’t have enough athletes that can connect the dots with health and add sustainability.” - RP It’s a common story: consumers say they want more sustainable products, but often – when it comes down to it – don’t buy them. And that puts companies in the position of guessing, making it difficult to show the financial value of sustainability beyond risk management. This is even more frustrating given that moving the needle on sustainability may take more commitment than it did before. As Scott Davis, chief concept officer of Panera Bread, said at a plenary session at Sustainable Brands today: “The low-handing fruit in this world is already picked. Everything we’re doing now involves a little more cost or a little more [effort].” Mission Measurement Corp is hoping to help solve this problem. On Wednesday, CEO Jason Saul announced new data tools – the Social Value Score and the Social Value Scorecard (pdf) – that aim to quantify the effect of social impacts efforts on consumer demand, evaluate which social efforts drive value and estimate the revenue increases that are likely to result from improving a company’s social value score. The index uses an established consumer market research technique – combined with a proprietary research process – to evaluate what people do, rather than just what they say they will do, and to find out which social factors statistically influence purchasing decisions, he said. “A big breakthrough is that we have found we can measure consumer demand for sustainability in same way we measure consumer demand for any other benefit,” he said. “We need to use data to drive strategy; we need to use real data to back up the business case.” It’s more important than ever to prove that sustainability affects sales, he added. “Last year, sustainability was one of the top five drivers of business growth on CEO’s agenda,” he said. “This year, it’s not. That worries me. … We need to get back up there.” From the research so far, it turns out that many of the top drivers for consumer demand are not what we thought, Saul said. “Many of the factors that all of us are working on in sustainability and in CSR departments are actually the least important factors to consumers,” he said. “The things we thought were so important to us – are we ethical, do we protect the environment, are we ethical, are we giving money to charity – have actually no statistical relevance to consumers in purchase intent. It doesn’t mean we don’t do them, but we need to be more intentional about what we do and why we’re doing them.” That said, many efforts can be repackaged as consumer benefits, he said, such as reduced asthma, a cleaner community or less waste and garbage in your neighborhood instead of protecting the environment. “We need to change the conception of CSR from merely doing good to a benefit delivery vehicle,” he said. “We can achieve many of the tenets and beliefs we hold about sustainability if we find a way to inject them into commerce in a way that’s sustainable economically. We may fail ourselves and fail our entire movement if we can’t show meaningful contribution to business growth.” Data has been a strong theme of this year’s conference. But not all attendees welcomed the idea of using data to sell more products. “It’s depressing to me – the goal of measuring social impact to sell new stuff is not going to get us to a sustainable planet,” said Pamela Wilhelms, founder of Wilhelms Consulting, at the event. “We can’t continue to increase consumption and support nine billion people on the planet.” - JK While some insist that investors are only interested in short-term gains and lack focus on long-term sustainability, SASB’s director of stakeholder engagement Katie Schmitz Eulitt insisted that investors do care. But they must go on a “treasure hunt” to find good data, she said at the Sustainable Brands conference on Tuesday. “They’re disappointed about the kind of information that they’re finding out there in the marketplace,” she said. “They want comparable data and benchmarks.” SASB plans to have 49 standards out by the end of 2014. Schmitz Eulitt said that reporting just for the sake of reporting isn’t going to change anything. “It’s about baking this into the DNA of companies, integrating the information and getting management on board.” Trucost’s Libby Bernick senior vice president, North America, said that it’s often a compelling event—like a water shortage—that leads a company to natural capital accounting. She gave the example of EcoLab, which is working with Trucost to develop an app that estimates the global cost of water. Trucost estimates that unpriced natural capital can be valued at $7.3tn trillion (pdf). Obtaining timely, reliable non-financial data is one of the challenges of integrated reporting, said Thomas Oldenwald, SVP of Sustainability Strategies at SAP, who talked about the company’s second integrated report that includes financial and sustainable information, using IIRC standards. He spoke about how the company set a goal to reduce its carbon emissions down to 2000 levels. But SAP underestimated how quickly its customers accelerated into the cloud, and then fell under the scope of the company’s reporting, ballooning their initial estimates. Ideally, he would love to see financial data and natural capital integrated into internal dashboards for CFOs in real time. “Natural capital should not become an afterthought,” Oldenwald said. “It’s extremely important to get it on the dashboard right away.” He points out that natural capital account runs the risk of creating more silos. “My biggest fear is that we create another stovepipe and lose the attention of stakeholders, CFOs and shareholders.” - RP There’s a lot of talk at Sustainable Brands about the power of authentic communication so I just want to highlight an example of a truly inspiring talk and one that truly missed the mark. Paul Dillinger, head of global product innovation at Levi Strauss, gave a powerful speech about the impact designers can have when they understand their ability to influence a whole system, from choosing appropriate materials to transforming the factories which produce the products they create. The reason the talk touched everyone was because Dillinger was clearly so nervous to be on stage. You could tell that 95% of him was uncomfortable to be in front of so many people, but he chose to do it anyway because there was something important he needed to say. The audience recognized his courage and the appreciation was palpable. By contrast, Gayle Schueller VP of global sustainability at 3M, chose the corporate route which won her no friends. All week there has been a demonstration against 3M outside the Paradise Point resort, both on land and from a boat out in the harbour. Of course, at the very least, the right thing would have been to acknowledge this, but she didn’t. When asked about it afterwards, she said she could not comment without clearance from the comms team. Now it’s true that Schueller is a physicist and may not find it easy to communicate off the cuff, but sustainability is all about human connections and she may want to reflect on how she can engage more deeply. As one participant told me: “I was convinced by the story from Levi Strauss because everything Paul was saying was so honest. The head of sustainability at 3M should have addressed the demonstration and been honest about what is going on.” Another delegate was more blunt: “Schueller should have welcomed the demonstrators into the resort and onto the stage so there could have been some honest open dialogue -JC Daniel Aronson, founder of sustainability tool developer Valutus (who formerly led sustainability strategy consulting for Deloitte and IBM), tells me he hasn't found any surprise downsides to sustainability so far. But he regularly finds surprise upsides, he says, with sustainability initiatives delivering three to 10 times their expected value. \"If sustainability is worth 10 times (or three times) what people think it is, they're going to dramatically underinvest in it,\" he says. - JK Another in our series of sustainable selfies. Luis O'rea on making sustainable lifestyles fun and desirable: While Sustainable Brands attendees may already be convinced of the need for sustainability, many others in the business community still need proof that sustainability will positively impact their bottom line, Clinton Moloney, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), told me at the conference yesterday. “Here at Sustainable Brands it’s all about doing the right thing, but we know that’s not the dominant mindset,” he said. The prevalent question, says Amy Longsworth, also a PwC managing director, is: “How do you know?” “Where are the numbers to measure that actions are having a net positive impact? How do you know investing in water makes more sense than investing in public health or something else?” she asked. “It’s very important to have these numbers to make the connection to real-world business. “The street is still the street, investors are still investors. They have to know the actual value (of these initiatives).” In PwC’s annual CEO survey about mega trends expected to affect business in the future resource scarcity and climate change landed in the top five. That represents a major shift in business awareness. “We were frankly overwhelmed,” Longsworth said. The change is also playing out among big investors. In a recent study of fund managers with at least $100bn of assets under management, more than one-third said they were using sustainability performance as a factor to determine where they put their money, Moloney said. That means companies that don’t rank well for sustainability performance are likely looking at a higher cost of capital in the future, he added. The need, of course, is greater than ever. In terms of economic risk from climate change, Moloney said, “we’re not just heading towards calamity, we’re accelerating towards it”. - JK • This post was amended on 5 June to make clear that the PwC study was of fund managers with at least $100bn of assets under management not $1bn. #GSBselfie Team GSB is asking Sustainable Brands attendees to use the selfie for good, and share their sustainability pledges. Here's author Christine Bader: What a difference a few decades makes. Take, for instance, the idea of diversity in the workforce. The 40s and 50s were the age of conformity, and diversity in the 60s was about “whether or not you wore glasses or if you wore a blue suit rather than the uniform gray”, said Andy Savitz, a principal consultant at Sustainable Business Strategies and author of Talent, Transformation, and the Triple Bottom Line at the Sustainable Brands conference, Tuesday. “The make up of the work force has changed as much as anything in society.\" Today, diversity is about making everyone feel comfortable, and part of that – for an employer – comes down to shared values, according to Savitz. In that sense, the diversity movement is helping to drive the sustainability movement, he added: Increasingly, employees expect employers to share those values … 90% of US graduates actively seek out employers whose corporate responsibility behavior reflects their own. In essence they are looking for purpose, not just a paycheck. In employee surveys, sustainability sometimes rates as highly as pay, benefits and feeling respected at work in terms of driving loyalty and commitment, Savitz said. Because of that, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important tool for human resources. “Employee engagement is turning out to be a key link in sustainability or triple-bottom-line programs,” Savitz said. “It’s an excellent way to attract top talent.” This dynamic is changing – and adding to – the business case for sustainability, he said. While the traditional argument for sustainability revolves around cost savings and risk reduction, the strong correlation between employee engagement and sustainability – and the connection between employee engagement and business success – represents a potentially stronger business case. He added: Attracting and engaging top talent is a more robust business case for sustainability than previously thought. Employee engagement drives performance. [Engaged] employees are more productive, more helpful, less likely to leave the company, less likely to be absent for work, more likely to put in extra effort. … It’s quite possible the business benefits of higher productivity, higher retention rates, would equal or exceed the traditional business case for sustainability. - JK Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Samsung, Tata, Unilever and Nestlé are the the world’s most responsible companies, according to a new global survey. The 2014 Aspirational Consumer Index by consultants BBMG and GlobeScan, which has been released at Sustainable Brands, suggests that brands which “deliver exceptional products and services, inspire personal relationships, support community initiatives and protect the environment are most likely to drive perceptions of responsibility.” Breaking it down to a national level and BMW, Carrefour, Ford, Google, Honda, Hyundai, IKEA, McDonald’s, Natura, PepsiCo, Petrobras, Target and Tesco also get mentions in the list's rankings of the top three most responsible companies across 21 countries. - JC As brands work to shift the economy towards sustainability, some 2,500 executives and experts are gathering at the Sustainable Brands conference in San Diego this week. We'll blog here about takeaways from the event, including quotes from business and thought leaders, case studies and new ideas on how companies can move the needle."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2012/jun/11/renewable-energy-global-investment-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-11T15:03:18Z","webTitle":"Global investment in renewable energy at record high","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/11/renewable-energy-global-investment-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jun/11/renewable-energy-global-investment-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Global investment in renewable energy at record high","bodyText":"Global investment in renewable energy surged to a new high last year, despite the widespread recession. But experts warned that the rate of growth was showing signs of slowing, and would need to speed up if the world's economies are to be transformed on to a low-carbon footing. Last year, investment in renewable energy reached $257bn (£165bn), a rise of 17% on the previous year. The record investment was a six-fold increase on the 2004 figure and nearly double the total in 2007, the year before the world financial crisis, according to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). However, the rate of growth has fallen year on year – last year's growth of 17% on the previous year failed to match the 37% increase in investment from 2010 to 2011. \"We need to do more, if we are to combat climate change and use low-carbon technology, said a representative for REN21. \"These figures are very good, but there is still a long way to go.\" The US and China were the top investors in renewables last year. US investments continued despite the shale gas boom and obstacles because of uncertainty over policy. However, the boom – which saw investment of $51bn (£33bn) – may be shortlived as investors are rushing to take advantage of key incentive schemes before they are scrapped. Wind power, usually the biggest single target for renewable investment, was surpassed by solar power as falling component prices fuelled a surge of interest – the technology received nearly twice the money directed at wind, which has generally been regarded as the most mature technology in the past. Total investment in solar power jumped 52% to $147bn (£95bn). The authors pointed in particular to rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations in Italy and Germany, the rapid spread of small-scale PV to other countries from China to the UK, as well as major new investments in solar thermal power (CSP) projects in Spain and the US. The report, called Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2012, used data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Renewable sources now supply 16.7% of global energy consumption, according to the report, but much of that is biomass used for cooking and heating in developing countries. The authors said the share provided by traditional biomass had declined slightly while the share sourced from modern renewable technologies had risen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"local-government-network/2013/jun/17/bristol-pound-local-currencies","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-professional","sectionName":"Guardian Professional","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-17T07:01:00Z","webTitle":"Bristol pound is just one example of what local currencies can achieve","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/jun/17/bristol-pound-local-currencies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/local-government-network/2013/jun/17/bristol-pound-local-currencies","fields":{"headline":"Bristol pound is just one example of what local currencies can achieve","bodyText":"The budgets of local authorities are being cut while the needs of their populations remain the same. In this difficult financial environment, borrowing is rising. UK local authorities owed £81.8bn in the financial year 2011-12, costing hundreds of millions in interest on repayments. However, borrowing on the money market is not going to do anything for the local economy. Faced with this reality, some councils are discovering that the use of local currencies offers an alternative to more cuts or debt. Mayor Georg Moosbrugger from the Austrian village of Langenegg, which issues its own Talente currency, puts it best when he says: \"Wherever the money rolls, there it has an effect. Local money doesn't roll very far and so it can get to work in my area.\" The community council can decide which local taxes may be paid in local currency to subsidise the rural economy, keep purchasing power in the region and support cultural and educational organisations as well as solar energy generation. Social enterprises also accept local money in payment for local food, arts and crafts and holiday lets. In Britain, local businesses in Brixton and Bristol can pay their rates in local pounds. The local authority uses this income to pay its employees, who then spend it with local businesses. The mayor of Bristol, George Ferguson, takes 100% of his salary in Bristol Pounds (₤B) and the chief executive accepts ₤5,000 of her salary in \"local\". The city also earns local currency from market traders who use their ₤B earnings to pay their pitch fees. Now 50 Lambeth council employees even receive some of their wages in Brixton Pounds through the payroll and so increase spending in the local economy. Leader of Lambeth council, Lib Peck, says the Brixton Pound \"has proved to be a really good way to encourage people to think and act locally. It encourages people to shop locally, supports our local businesses and fosters an even greater sense of local pride.\" The Brixton and Bristol Pounds are run by not-for-profit community interest companies, which helps ensure that the local currency is run in the public interest. In times of austerity, cities want to attract employers and tourists, but have little cash for marketing. International media coverage of the Brixton and Bristol Pound launches was worth hundreds of thousands of pounds in advertising, and promoted their vibrant and entrepreneurial communities. The city of Nantes, France has been even more ambitious. Citizens and businesses will soon be able to earn local currency and use it to offer goods and services, pay for bus tickets, car parking and after-school activities and pay their rates. A lot of the pioneering work has already been done. The New Economics Foundation, Tudor Trust, Doen Foundation and Qoin have supported the Brixton and Bristol Pound teams to develop the technology for both e-payments and for circulating notes with full security features. The potential of local currencies as an innovative response to austerity and recession is even becoming recognised at European level. A European Union funded project Community Currencies in Action is now helping the public sector to understand the purpose and function of local currencies through a series of pilot projects. They have also established the legal basis for local currencies with the Financial Services Authority. Twenty other UK authorities have shown a serious interest and a number are currently developing local projects. Professor Jem Bendell of the University of Cumbria, which offers training for local authorities and others in how to create and scale local currencies, says: \"There is a need to experiment with new systems, and replicate what works.\" In the Great Depression of the 1930s many local authorities created their own currencies to help put people back to work. They were eventually closed down by central banks and central governments. But could a more enlightened policy like this work today? Taking this view, local authorities could lead the economic revival of Britain, and some councils are already showing the way.

But before you can look at the careers that could develop from this, you need to understand the current state of the sector. A revolution in shale gas will transform the United States into a major gas exporter by 2020. The impact on oil-centred economies, such as in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, will be profound. China now produces as much oil as America's largest international corporations. Resource plays for oil and gas are also opening up in emerging economies on a scale not witnessed before, and in the most fragile of the world's ecosystems, such as the shallow waters of the Caspian Sea. While carbon markets in the EU have collapsed, new emission trading schemes will expand in other areas, such as Japan, China and California. In the UK, the government has introduced a controversial base price for carbon dioxide emissions, which is set to increase in annual increments to £30 per tonne by 2020. Research from Carbon Tracker, an organisation that supports the financial markets to tackle climate change, has shown that we can't burn all the carbon currently on the books of the major oil, gas and extraction corporations without adverse climatic consequences. Infrastructure funding is also needed to support a global population moving towards 10 billion by the end of the century. But increasing regulation aimed at the banking sector will inevitably lead to significant increases in the cost of borrowing, and quantitative easing must come to an end eventually. These factors combine to create disruptive opportunities for those seeking careers in and around the industry. Among these, here are some of the most exciting: Law and accounting The private and public sectors need to build capacity around the developments mentioned above. This presents career opportunities in law, investigative or \"forensic\" accounting where you drill into the detail around the numbers and audit. For example, in Mongolia – one of the fastest growing economies in the world with immense natural resources yet to be exploited – there are only a handful of internationally-qualified accountants. Yet the new flows of wealth that will occur demand transparency of markets if benefits are to be fairly shared. Tax It may be difficult to find petroleum taxation an exciting opportunity, but it is. Tax practitioners will be in demand as individual states and international oil corporations look to design fairness and proportionality into taxes on new energy resources. This could take you all over the world, from Norway to Nigeria. Issues around the neutrality of the tax process – and the need to tax according to life cycle revenues and expenditures – will create complex and challenging opportunities for those working in the sector. Environmental roles As activity develops in remote locations with fragile ecosystems, the need for environmental scientists and economists will exacerbate the chronic shortages of engineers already being experienced in the industry. Experts in environmental assurance, for example, will be in greater demand in the public and private sectors. Funders In general, the renewables sector offers many opportunities for youthful, entrepreneurial thinking from the heavy engineering at London Array – the largest offshore wind farm in the world – to redesigning the humble washing machine or the energy-saving Dyson hand dryer. Industrial design and designers will enter a golden age of opportunity. Project financiers also will be in demand, both from the private and public sectors. They will need to learn from the past experiences and mistakes of public-private partnerships to develop innovative, fair and cost-effective funding models. In particular, there will be demand for individuals who can design, build and test finance models that can calculate profit and cashflow throughout the lifecycle of a resource, from exploration through to decommissioning. They will also need to ensure this can be understood across the public and private sector. Peer-to-peer lending will grow as funding from traditional banking institutions becomes prohibitively expensive. These organisations link businesses looking for funding with potential investors. In the UK the largest are Zopa, RateSetter and Funding Circle, but they will rapidly grow and create opportunities for regulators, assurers, and providers of due diligence. Research from Shell has also suggested that there could be a remarkable increase of solar energy as governments with the right climate seek to exploit this opportunity. Already the solar industry in the UK is growing rapidly, albeit from a low baseline. And this is an industry effectively starting from scratch, requiring a wide range of skills from the entrepreneurial through to business development and marketing. And for those seeking a career in public relations, the exploitation and refining activities of the oil and gas industry offer tremendous opportunities to effectively communicate the challenges and imperatives of the current situation. Whether that's corporate social responsibility, corporate governance and ethics or working internationally, the opportunities are endless. Finally, teaching – particularly in higher education and in emerging economies – will become a priority for many governments wishing to develop their education capacity, as their revenues from oil and gas activities materialise.

Responding to criticism of his objection to a solar farm near his home in Suffolk last week, he said it was \"not really a Nimby issue,\" that he was not a climate sceptic and he thought the UK should be powered by new nuclear reactors, not renewable energy. \"We surely need better solutions to global warming than randomly scattered whirly-gigs [sic], and thousands of acres of glinting solar panels, however soothing to our consciences,\" he wrote in a letter to the Guardian. Jones has criticised wind turbines as \"green tokenism\" in the past but his new broadside ups the temperature and broadens his criticism to taxpayer support of green energy, the planning system and the reliability of wind and solar power. \"[The] government is hiding behind subsidy-hunting free enterprise. The result of this has been and is random desecration, with little or no accountability,\" he said of windfarms that he felt were badly sited. He also suggested the intermittent nature of renewable energy undermined its environmental credentials. \"How can we effect [sic] to be green, when we use gas from uncertain fossil fuel driven sources as back up? It is logical to ask why we are assaulting our shrinking countryside in the name of this apparent hypocrisy.\" A \"distorted\" planning system was failing to protect green spaces, he added, but \"aiding and abetting an exponential grab at the countryside.\" Instead of solar power, which \"doesn't operate\" at night, he said he would like to see more nuclear power, such as two new planned reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, because it would cut carbon emissions, provide more power than solar and had a small physical footprint. \"I am not a climate change sceptic. I am a solution sceptic,\" he said. Jones has emerged as one of the most prominent celebrity opponents of renewable energy. He is not the first well-known TV personality to do so – in 2004, Noel Edmonds gave his backing to anti-wind campaigns following plans for windfarms near his home in Devon. A spokeswoman for trade body RenewableUK said: \"RenewableUK has always advocated a balanced mix to decarbonise our power system and achieve security of supply. The benefits of this can be seen for example when Sizewell B was offline for several months and wind generated the equivalent of electricity for 400,000 homes annually. While no power source generates for 100% of the time, therefore back-up is needed on the system, every unit of wind produced saves us burning polluting imported fossil fuels.\" Adam Royle, a spokesman for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said that solar farms were of increasing concern to its members. \"Solar energy has a role to play in helping the UK to meet its renewable energy targets, as part of a mix of renewable technologies. However CPRE's members and supporters are increasingly concerned about the size and scale of some proposed solar parks, and the impact they could have on the landscape. Applications that would take high grade agricultural land out of productive use are particularly concerning. There is a vacuum in planning policy that the government needs to address so that solar farms do not spoil the countryside, are directed to brownfield sites and are of appropriate size and scale.\" Jeremy Leggett, whose comment article in the Guardian Jones was responding to, said: \"I'm glad that Griff's whole belief system on energy is out in the open now. It's more useful to have these kinds of debates in a holistic context. Let's see how his case fares in reversing the opinion polls that show big majorities of people favouring 'scattered whirly-gigs, and glinting solar panels', and believing – as the Germans are showing every day – that in fact they do a rather good job of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/24/solar-power-subsidy-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-24T14:55:36Z","webTitle":"UK solar subsidy to be cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/24/solar-power-subsidy-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/24/solar-power-subsidy-cut","fields":{"headline":"UK solar subsidy to be cut","bodyText":"Payments for home owners using solar panels to generate electricity are to be cut further, the government said on Thursday, which is set to be the hottest day of the year with widespread sunshine in the UK. The feed-in tariff for solar photovoltaic panels fitted to existing homes will be cut by about a quarter, from 21p per kWh to 16p, and the length of payments reduced from 25 to 20 years. However, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said financial returns would still be around 6% for homeowners, down from the 7-10% when the scheme launched in 2010, as panel costs have fallen. The changes take effect on 1 August, one month later than planned, after the government missed a legal deadline for making the changes on 1 July. Future tariff rates will also be assessed every three months and automatically cut or held depending on the number of panels installed in the last quarter, the government said. The climate minister, Greg Barker, said: \"The sector has been through a difficult time, adjusting to the reality of sharply falling costs, but the reforms we are introducing today provide a strong, sustainable foundation for growth for the solar sector. We can now look with confidence to a future for solar which will see it go from a small cottage industry, anticipated under the previous scheme, to playing a significant part in Britain's clean energy economy.\" The fall in the incentives, which was expected, comes after a tumultuous six months for the solar power industry. The government lost three court cases after solar companies and Friends of the Earth challenged its rushed halving of the Fit payments late last year. New rules have also been brought in that mean homes must meet energy efficiency standards before becoming eligible for the scheme, and recent data shows installations fell 90% after the most recent subsidy cut. But solar industry, consumer groups, and green campaigners welcomed the new changes for bringing clarity. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: \"Consumers need certainty on the returns they will receive, if they are to have the confidence to invest in this technology. So it is good news that the government has now shed the light on the final subsidy.\" Jeremy Leggett, chairman at Solarcentury, said: \"Though investor confidence will remain uncertain given the proposed three-monthly digressions, the majority of the government's policies may herald a new seriousness of intent on solar, and indicate that a meaningful solar industrial policy is now a real prospect for the UK.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/local-councils-see-the-light-led-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-16T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Will local councils see the light on LED technology?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/local-councils-see-the-light-led-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/local-councils-see-the-light-led-technology","fields":{"headline":"Will local councils see the light on LED technology?","bodyText":"Visitors to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer will find a city transformed by the £0.5bn poured into new sporting venues and beefing up the city's infrastructure. But there is an even more fundamental transformation under way in Scotland's biggest city. By next summer, it will be firmly on track to becoming a world-leading \"smart\" city, having won £25m from the government's Technology Strategy Board to show how a city can use cutting-edge digital and wireless technology to provide services such as roads, security and lighting to its citizens more efficiently, while cutting CO2 emissions. And lighting is one of three key areas where Glasgow is trying to shine as a smart city. In November, the council announced that by next summer the sulphurous orange glow of 10,000 sodium street lights will be replaced with the crisp white light of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and compact fluorescent bulbs, cutting the city's energy and maintenance bills. But the really smart bit is that Glasgow will test the way LED lights, unlike their technological predecessors, can be equipped with digital sensors allowing them to be controlled remotely, and to respond to changes in the local environment, such as an increase in traffic. Such intelligent controls can push the average energy savings with LED lighting from 50% to 70%, according to the European commission. Yet a recent roundtable discussion on the future of lighting in cities – hosted by the Guardian in association with GE Lighting – heard that only 10% of new public streetlights are LED based. So what is preventing LEDs from being installed in every house, skyscraper and city street? How do you flick the switch on the LED revolution? Ben Ferrari, director of corporate relationships for the Climate Group, a not-for-profit organisation working globally with governments and business on the green economy, told the workshop that LED could be a critical weapon against climate change, as lighting accounts for almost 20% of global electricity use. At the recent UN climate conference in Warsaw, the Climate Group renewed its call for all new public lighting globally to be LED by 2020. \"If we are facing peak emissions this decade, scale for LED isn't just desirable,\" Ferrari said. \"We have to get where we are going, and we have to get there quickly.\" Energy savings The roundtable – which included representatives from industry, law, environmental groups and government-funded bodies – agreed that the technology is now ripe for take-off. One of the biggest barriers to LED competing in the market for general lighting has been high cost. But research from management consultancy McKinsey shows that costs are dropping 30% a year. And efficiency rates and life-spans are going just as quickly in the opposite direction, so that by 2020 the energy saving compared to today's conventional lighting is expected to reach 90%. Guardian executive editor Jo Confino, who chaired the discussion, asked if the technology is changing too quickly, making councils reluctant to invest in what is effectively a moving target. Ronald Hendrikx, partner at Bird &amp; Bird, a law firm that is working with the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change on the roll-out of smart meters, said that with the rapid growth of companies in the sector, \"the amount of choice available is baffling. You don't know where to stop or start.\" Falling costs are also an excuse for cities to put off a decision. But Iain Watson, director of energy efficiency for the Green Investment Bank (GIB), said the savings in energy and maintenance costs that councils can make by acting today are already so substantial that delay no longer makes financial sense. Although Glasgow's decision to replace its street lights was independent of the smart city funding, the money will be used for pilot projects that pair LED lighting on a stretch of road with smart controls and wireless technology, enabling city planners to monitor traffic, air quality, congestion and noise levels, and respond accordingly. The LED replacement is a simpler proposition. It costs Glasgow £8.5m a year to power and repair its ageing light network. Since the new lamps are expected to use less than half the energy of the old ones, and last three to seven times longer, the council said the £9m investment in LEDs will be quickly recouped. Strategic thinking But recognising the savings requires strategic thinking at a high level, Watson said. \"The feeling from the GIB is that we are on the cusp of local authorities understanding the technologies, but you need a visionary to drive forward support for it, because it doesn't sit in any one team. It needs to get up to the chief executive level to see the benefits, because it is not just the kit that you buy, but the savings you are going to get from it over the long term.\" Dan Palmer, head of market development for the British Standards Institution (BSI), agrees. \"A lot of technology works and could be deployed by cities, but the city isn't able to act as an intelligent customer,\" Palmer said. He added that cities are also unaccustomed to working in partnerships with companies in smart city projects and at a level that spans different departments. \"There isn't a single person whose responsibility it is.\" To overcome this, the BSI was asked by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to come up with smart city guidelines and standards, and it has been working to share the experience of Glasgow and its industry partners with other councils. The first standard will be published next month. Ersel Oymak, innovations technology manager at Cisco Systems, which is working on Glasgow's smart city initiative, said one way to sell LED lighting to cities is to focus on its potential to have social benefits that extend far beyond lighting, if used intelligently. Studies have shown that patients in hospital recover better and students achieve more in school if exposed to lighting conditions that adapt to their needs. \"We need to raise awareness in local authorities so that they grasp this is the sustainable and strategic thing to do,\" Oymak said. But Agostino Renna, chief executive officer of GE Lighting, said in his experience few cities are capable of such strategic thinking. And the focus on ever-smarter technology runs the risk of putting them off simpler solutions, such as LED replacement. \"I am convinced the answer isn't more technology,\" he said. \"I'm a big fan of evolution instead of revolution. Small things that work well, done repeatedly by a lot of people, can make a big difference.\" Several participants called for technology companies to focus less on technology and more on innovative business models that will remove the upfront costs of LED lighting from hard-pressed UK councils facing budget cuts. Bulen Hourshid, director of value engineering at consultancy Aecom, said: \"Local authorities have an annual budget. Green technology is all about getting investment back over time. But councils don't want to invest in something that won't give them payback within two to three years.\" Dax Lovegrove, head of business engagement at WWF, said one answer could be performance contracts. He pointed to the success of SolarCity in the US, which has cornered the US solar panel market in a few short years by selling solar energy as a service, with no upfront cost to customers to buy and install the solar panels. SolarCity's customers sign a contract agreeing to pay a monthly fee for electricity that is cheaper than they would pay to their local utility. Financing comes from banks, which get a return for the life of the contract. John Raspin, partner in the energy and environment group at legal firm Frost &amp; Sullivan, said such performance contracts could be the way of the future. \"There needs to be a fundamental thinking shift, from selling a product or solution to selling an outcome.\" Several participants lamented the lack of political will to tackle energy efficiency, with cash-strapped councils neglecting their climate-change targets and the UK government considering scrapping green levies and reviewing its targets for cutting CO2 emissions. In Brussels, European legislators, who boosted the LED industry by imposing a phased ban on incandescent bulbs, are debating setting binding targets for energy-efficiency savings by 2030, a move that would be another huge fillip to the industry. But Ferrari said strong opposition from business lobby groups could scupper these efforts unless progressive companies champion the cause. Like GE's Renna, he thinks the push for LED shouldn't be mixed up with the drive for smart cities, which will take many years to bear fruit. \"The message to cities is don't wait. There are lots of practical solutions you can do now,\" Ferrari said. \"They don't prevent a smart future, but they don't wait for it, either.\" At the table Jo Confino (Chair) Executive editor, the Guardian John Raspin Partner in the energy and environment group, Frost &amp; Sullivan Agostino Renna Chief executive officer, GE Lighting Ersel Oymak Innovations technology manager, Cisco Systems Ronald Hendrikx Partner, Bird &amp; Bird Ben Ferrari Director of corporate relationships, the Climate Group Iain Watson Director, energy efficiency, Green Investment Bank Bulen Hourshid Director, value engineering project, cost and consultancy, Aecom Dax Lovegrove Head of business engagement, WWF Simon Brammer UK Programme manager, Ashden Mark Reynolds Account director, Carbon Trust Dan Palmer Head of market development, British Standards Institution Simon den Uijl Secretary General of The Connected Lighting Alliance Roundtable report commissioned and controlled by the Guardian.

The costings released by shadow treasurer Joe Hockey on Thursday show that if the Coalition wins power on Saturday it will save $7.47bn over the forward estimates from its key pledge to remove the carbon price, which is scheduled to move to a floating market-based system next year. The savings will come from the ending of business compensation measures and other apparatus around the carbon price, although household assistance will remain in place. But the Coalition will also lose out on $13.51bn in forgone revenue from businesses that no longer have to pay for their carbon emissions. Therefore, removing the carbon price will cost Australia a net $6.04bn in the period until 2016-17. The emissions reduction fund, one part of the Coalition's direct action plan, won't kick in until 2014-15, if enacted. For 2014-15 it has set aside $300m for the scheme, which offers incentives to businesses to reduce their carbon emissions, rising to $750m in 2016-17. The total amount pledged for the scheme in the forward estimates is $1.55bn. Conservation groups have attacked the measures, claiming that more than $2bn has been cut from overall environmental spending. The total earmarked for the Direct Action plan, which includes money for projects such as green urban corridors as well as emissions reduction, is $2.88bn, down from the $3.2bn originally budgeted for. The Coalition plans to spend $300m over the four years to create a 15,000-strong \"green army\" but it will cut $40m over the same period in support for geothermal and tidal power, $60m from clean energy employment hubs and $185m from a scheme to connect renewable power to the grid. Further cuts at the Department of Climate Change, which has already been dissolved as a standalone entity, will save $45m, the Coalition has stated, while the public rebate has been halved for a scheme to install a million rooftop solar panels over the next decade. The rebate on offer will now be $500 rather than $1,000 and will be administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Association. Serious question marks have been placed over the efficiency and cost of the Coalition's Direct Action plan to reduce emissions, with two separate analyses finding it will need billions of extra dollars to achieve the bipartisan 5% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, on 2000 levels. Abbott has ruled out extra funding for the scheme. The campaigns director at Environment Victoria, Mark Wakeham, told Guardian Australia the Coalition had broken its environmental promises before even entering government. \"The costings are worse than we expected in several ways,\" he said. \"It will cost $6bn to remove the carbon tax over the forward estimates, as well as $1.5bn for direct action. So we'll be paying $7.5bn to replace a scheme with one that everyone thinks is much worse. It seems crazy. \"This means that it's not just a question of which will be more expensive out of a carbon price and Direct Action – we'll be paying for both. \"It also looks like it is backing away from its commitment to solar energy. There's no evidence that giving a $500 rebate will deliver one million solar roofs. If there are going to be incentives, they will need to be better than $500, especially for solar-powered hot water, which is more expensive than solar PV.\" Wakeham said he was also concerned by the delaying of $650m in water buybacks for the Murray-Darling basin plan. The Coalition has insisted the payments are still on track for the 2019 deadline to buy back water from land managers in order to replenish the river system with 3,200 gigalitres. \"Deferring the water buybacks is really a step towards collapsing the bipartisan approach to the basin plan,\" he said. \"I know a lot of people in the Coalition don't believe in the buybacks and when you push money beyond the forward estimates, it often disappears.\" \"The Murray-Darling process started under John Howard but there's a concern it may be weakened. It looks fragile.\" Clean energy advocates have also criticised the Coalition's approach to renewable energy by promising to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. \"Taxpayers would be worse off under an Abbott government with its chaotic, poorly modelled Direct Action plan,\" said Lindsay Soutar, director of 100% Renewable. \"Australians want more renewables, but this announcement again shows that the Coalition is out of touch with ordinary Australians' vision for a wind- and solar-powered future.\" But the Coalition environment spokesman, Greg Hunt, told Guardian Australia the falling cost of solar meant a smaller rebate would achieve the same results. On the prospects for Direct Action, Hunt said: \"You only have to look at what has happened in Europe and Australia to see that emissions trading hasn't been a success. In Europe it has been roundly denounced in both an economic and emissions sense. In Australia, we have an anti-jobs, anti-economic development tax that simply shifts our emissions overseas.\" Hunt said the Clean Energy Finance Corporation \"doesn't produce one additional watt\" of energy for Australia, claiming that the 20% renewable energy target was doing the \"heavy lifting\" for the growth of renewables. Overall, the Coalition has earmarked $2.01bn for its environmental policies over four years, significantly less than the $2.56bn it will spend on one road, the Pacific Highway, in that period. \"It's pretty clear the Coalition is prioritising issues other than the environment, which is disappointing,\" Wakeham said. \"On top of that, the plans they do have appear to be place holder policies. It's fair to say there are some worrying signs.\" Hunt said: \"The money pledged will be enough for the emissions reduction fund to do the jobs. I tell you what, many of my colleagues would have liked $2bn in additional funding in their portfolios. Many of them had wry smiles and asked how I got so much.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/utility-companies-business-model-redundant","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-16T16:34:00Z","webTitle":"Utility companies: has their business model become redundant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/utility-companies-business-model-redundant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/utility-companies-business-model-redundant","fields":{"headline":"Utility companies: has their business model become redundant?","bodyText":"The giant utility companies that provide our power are central to the economy and for decades their business model worked pretty well for them. But utilities around the world are facing an unprecedented range of challenges as nations seek to decarbonise their economies. Customers are paying more for their electricity while the generators are earning less, there is a need for massive investment in new power plants and power lines as ageing nuclear and coal plants come offline and rock-bottom carbon prices encourage the use of more polluting coal instead of cleaner gas. There's an increased focus on energy efficiency and a lot more distributed generation coming onto the grid. Jeremy Leggett, chairman of solar energy group Solarcentury and the Carbon Tracker Initiative, says the challenge is stark because the sector has lost the trust of customers. \"The big six [the main power generators] are arguably the most hated companies in Britain. The very viability of their current business model is in danger,\" he says. \"Their current fragile profitability is going to be shot to pieces in the years ahead by a deadly marriage of rising fossil fuel prices and new regulatory constraints that will be rooted in the extent to which they are hated.\" Part of the problem is that they are simply not making as much money as they did in the past. Annett Urbaczka, head of group press relations at RWE, the German utility, says that the euro crisis has depressed demand for power from industrial groups throughout Europe, cutting the average price from €50/MWh (£42/MWh) to €38/MWh (£32/MWh). In addition, German utility companies such as RWE and E.ON, which also have operations in the UK, are seeing their margins hollowed out in Europe's biggest economy by the increasing amount of renewable energy capacity on the grid. Previously, utilities could expect a price peak around noon that benefited fast-reacting medium-load, mainly gas-fired power plants, Urbaczka says. \"But now more than 30GW of solar capacity is ready to produce power at noon. Renewable energy has priority access to the grid and conventional power plants have to adjust their production accordingly.\" On days that are both sunny and windy, allowing both wind and solar generators to produce power, this can mean electricity generators having to pay their customers to take their surplus power. The size of Germany's power market and the fact that Europe still lacks a truly integrated single energy market means that this excess German renewables capacity is playing havoc with its neighbours' grid systems as well. As a result, the average usage of the gas-fired plants has fallen significantly – for example, RWE's three units at Lingen in north-western Germany produced more than 4,000GWh in 2011, while in the first half of 2013 they produced only 700GWh. \"In the long term such capacity utilisation is not enough for them to be viable so we are forced to review our capacity regularly and – in the worst case – to mothball plants,\" Urbaczka adds. RWE announced earlier this year that it would take offline about 3,100MW of capacity in Germany and the Netherlands. Yet plunging wholesale prices are not translating into cheaper retail prices for German domestic customers because they are being asked to pay for renewable energy subsidies, while industrial users enjoy cheaper power prices. Meanwhile, European Union rules are leading to the unbundling of transmission networks, depriving utilities of another source of revenue, says Colin Campbell, head of the Renewable Infrastructure team at Zouk Capital. \"It was regulated, boring, reliable and underpinned many utilities. They are losing a stable platform.\" Moves to improve energy efficiency and the advent of energy storage will further cut demand for electricity over time, he adds. At the same time, the roll-out of renewable energy capacity is bringing new players into the market. Investment funds such as Foresight and Greencoat Capital have recently listed on the London Stock Exchange to raise money to invest in solar and wind assets, while a number of pension funds are finding that the long-term nature of power purchase agreements and support payments, along with the above average returns, make renewable assets an increasingly attractive investment. \"We are likely to see the big infrastructure funds and pension funds owning a lot more generation assets in future,\" says Bertie Readhead, senior analyst at Jones Lang LaSalle. The falling cost of renewable energy technologies, in particular solar, also creates an existential threat for the utilities as more and more householders partially or wholly opt out of the power system by generating their own energy. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade body for US power groups, warned in a report earlier this year that the growth of distributed generation leaves the power companies in the same position as airlines and telephone companies were in the late 1970s. Deregulation transformed the airline sector while telecoms experienced a technological revolution. As a result, \"in the airline sector, each of the major US carriers that were in existence prior to deregulation in 1978 faced bankruptcy,\" the EEI says. \"The telecommunication businesses of 1978, meanwhile, are not recognisable today, nor are the names of many of the players and the service they once provided.\" And back home, energy minister Greg Barker has called for \"the big Six to become the big 60,000\" to create a \"greener, more local energy sector\". Utilities are facing regulatory, political and technological challenges – and if they fail to embrace them, they will struggle to survive. Their route to survival, says Leggett, \"is early embrace of this coming paradigm shift, ahead of their core competitors: the kind of shift in business model that goes beyond the steps IBM eventually took in order to survive and ultimately prosper in the wake of the microcomputer.\" Yet large utility companies will still be central to the market in years to come, says Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, the sector's trade association. \"We are likely to see more smaller companies coming into the market, while there will also be more external financing and there are significant opportunities for local community schemes,\" she says. \"Exactly how the sector will look in years to come, though, is hard to say. We are in a situation that is not only very complex but also very fluid.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The German government has said it has been forced to cut subsidies for solar panels, because demand was so high it could no longer afford to support the green technology. Friday's announcement has left Germans rushing to install solar panels on buildings ahead of the planned cut in subsidies of up to 30%. The government has explained its decision as a way of slowing the rapid growth in the sector, saying it was one of Germany's success stories, but had been allowed to grow too fast and had been too heavily subsidised. \"We've already seen a huge reduction in the incentives in the past few years but the incentives were still too high,\" the environment minister, Norbert Röttgen, said. \"Solar is a success story made in Germany. We want it to be an acceptable technology not only in the future but right now but the cost factor has to be at acceptable levels.\" Environmentalists, renewable energy experts and industry representatives have expressed incredulity at the 30% cut from 9 March, following earlier cuts of up to 50% over the past three years. They said it was a huge blow for the fledgling industry and a contradiction in terms for a country planning to phase out nuclear power. \"This plan amounts to nothing less than a solar phase-out law,\" said David Wedepohl, spokesman for the German Solar Industry Association, which represents 800 solar companies. \"Under these circumstances there's no way that the transition of the energy industry can be successful. It's also putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk, and it's tough both on investors and on citizens who want to be part of the energy transformation.\" Germany is the world's top installer of photovoltaic power, with a capacity of around 25,000 megawatts, almost as much as the rest of the world put together. It added a record 7,500 megawatts in 2011. The sun provides from 3.2% to – on sunny days at midday– up to 25% of Germany's energy. Wedepohl admitted: \"You could say we are the victims of our own success. The costs of solar energy have come down immensely due to technological development and scaleability so we're scratching our heads and wondering: why stop supporting this now?\" Germany has seen a huge increase in use of solar panels over the last two years, thanks to a subsidy system that utility companies are obliged to pay to people who generate their own solar power, which is then pumped into the grid. Power companies pass on the costs to their customers in their electricity bill. At a time of rising prices the government argues that it has to lessen the financial impact on consumers by decreasing the subsidies. The solar sector boom has seen everyone from farms to kindergartens making the most of the opportunities to erect solar panels on their roofs. There has even been a trend to form co-operatives and rent space on the roof of public buildings that have installed panels, such as swimming pools or schools. There are now 1.1m such systems in Germany. The proposed cuts would see the feed in tariff subsidy falling to 19.5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for small plants, and to 13.5 cents for plants of up to 10 megawatts. German retail electricity prices are between 21 and 24 cents per kWh. The decision must still pass through the cabinet and parliament but political observers believe it is likely to be approved. On Monday thousands of demonstrators are planning to gather at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to protest under the banner \"Stop the Solar Phase Out\". At a time when solar power is on the verge of costing the same as conventional power, due in large part to the fall in the costs of solar panels and their installation, renewable energy sector representatives have expressed their suspicions that the cuts are an attempt to appease the major energy companies who are losing out greatly to renewables, particularly since the decision last year to phase out nuclear power following the Fukishima disaster in Japan. \"We're taking a part of the market away for large electricity suppliers,\" said Wedepohl. \"But as a country we made a decision after Fukishima to phase out nuclear energy, so we need a lot of power.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/01/solar-panel-demand-subsidy-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-01T11:19:20Z","webTitle":"Solar panel demand down nearly 90% following subsidy cut","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/01/solar-panel-demand-subsidy-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/01/solar-panel-demand-subsidy-cut","fields":{"headline":"Solar panel demand down nearly 90% following subsidy cut","bodyText":"Solar panel installations have fallen by almost 90% in the weeks since the government halved cut the subsidy available, according to Department of Energy and Climate Change figures. The change in financial support for solar power has been highly controversial and has seen the government lose a high-profile legal case in the high court. The new data lends support to the charge of some in the solar industry that the government cut the subsidy too far and too fast, endangering thousands of jobs. Ministers have defended their actions, saying the scheme they inherited from the previous government was poorly set up and was too costly for the energy customers who ultimately foot the bill. Since 1 April, the amount paid to those installing solar panels fell from 43p/kWh of energy generated, to 21p/kWh. In the three weeks since then, an average of 2.4MW of solar photovoltaic capacity has been added each week – 87% down from the weekly average for the previous year of 18MW. Greg Barker, the Conservative minister responsible for the solar subsidy scheme, said the changes aimed to end \"solar booms\" and busts: \"The whole point of my reforms is to bring in a much greater degree of certainty and predictability.\" He has set an ambition to have 22GW of solar capacity installed in the UK by 2020. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, claimed on Tuesday that this target would take 169 years to reach at the current rate. \"For months Labour has been warning that the government's cuts to solar power would destroy thousands of jobs, cut off a green hi-tech British industry and stop families controlling soaring energy bills. These shocking figures prove that because of the government's cuts, it will take a staggering 169 years for us to reach our targets for solar power.\" \"To take only three weeks of data and use it to predict the next eight years is absurd,\" said Greg Barker, who accused Flint of political opportunism and learning nothing from the \"solar bubble\". Barker told the Guardian: \"As costs come down, the implementation will go up. It is not a straight line. The 22GW ambition looks very credible, but it does depend on bringing costs down through the government and industry working together. The good news is that is happening.\" He said new McKinsey research showed solar power would be cost-competitive with fossil fuels by 2020. Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said: \"We've seen drops in installation with every policy adjustment, but we expect this one will take a bit more time to pick up.\" He said the reason take-up would take longer this time is the new requirement that homes must be reasonably energy-efficient before being entitled to solar panel subsidies – a requirement met by about half of homes. \"Many householders are aware that government has slashed subsidies,\" Barwell added. \"The challenge for us is to make householders aware that's partly because industry has slashed costs, and partly because solar is so popular. There is no doubt that financially solar remains a great prospect for UK homeowners so there is no good reason why the UK market should stagnate.\" All sides agree that subsidies had to be reduced because the costs of solar panels continue to drop rapidly: the argument was about the speed and scale of the cut. In his first significant remarks on green policy last week, prime minister David Cameron appeared to address the uncertainty caused in the renewables industry by the changes to the feed-in tariff. \"When we have made a commitment to a project, we will always honour it in full,\" he told energy ministers from around the world on 26 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/22/energy-nuclear-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-22T05:15:00Z","webTitle":"Only renewables - not nuclear - could be too cheap to meter | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/22/energy-nuclear-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/may/22/energy-nuclear-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Only renewables - not nuclear - could be too cheap to meter","bodyText":"\"Too cheap to meter\": that was the infamous boast of the nuclear power industry in its heyday. It has been catastrophically discredited by history. Yet the phrase may yet see a new life - not of course for nuclear power - but for renewable energy. As the UK government publishes its draft energy bill on Tuesday, acknowledged by all but ministers themselves as primarily an arcane way of getting new nuclear power stations built, I am in Germany. Already, on one particularly windy weekend here, the surge of electricity drove the price down to zero. Very soon, due to the 25GW of solar capacity Germany has already installed, hot summer's days will see the same effect: electricity too cheap to meter. Now hang on, I hear you say, free electricity is actually crazy as it means there's no incentive to invest in new, clean generation capacity, which almost every country needs as the world seeks to cut the carbon emissions driving climate change. Germany's renewable energy policy, which began with a feed-in-tariff in 1990, deals with this by continuing to pay the producer, even when the electricity is sold for nothing. Crazy again, right? No, says Andreas Kraemer, director of the Ecologic Institute, an energy research policy centre, because the tax benefit to the Germany, via 400,000 jobs in the €40bn-a-year renewables industry is outweighs than the cost of the subsidy. Furthermore, he says, the contribution of renewable energy in cutting peak prices mean the wholesale cost of electricity is 10% lower than it would be without them. \"The money flowing out in FITs is less than the money saved by the end consumer,\" he says. And all the while a clean, sustainable energy system is built. But real problems do exist, and will intensify as Germany approaches its goal of 100% renewable electricity, from its current 20%. As that comes closer, the policies will have to change. Energy storage, already incentivised in Germany today, will need to be available, as will high-voltage interconnectors to move power around the continent and a smart grid to cleverly match demand to supply. It's an attractive vision: clean energy, securely supplied and coming down in price. Compare all this with the UK, where the nuclear industry is so embedded in government it supplies staff free-of-charge to work within the energy ministry. Perhaps it's no wonder that even when half of the UK's big six energy companies bale out of nuclear on cost grounds, ministers plough on regardless. The news that EDF, the French-state-owned giant that runs many of the UK's nuclear plants, wants to extend the lifetimes of their ageing reactors confirms their attraction to the so-called carbon floor price. This leg of government energy policy puts a minimum price on carbon emissions, delivering large windfalls to existing nuclear plants. New nuclear plants will also have to be subsidised, more than onshore wind and possibly more than offshore wind, according to recent analyses, which is shameful for a 60 year-old technology. \"In general in industry,\" says Kraemer, \"when the production of something doubles, the cost falls by about 15%. The only notable exception is the nuclear industry which gets more expensive the more you build.\" Recent reports, not denied by EDF, put the cost of their new plants in the UK at £7bn each, 40% higher than previously stated. So while mass-produced renewable energy technologies are pushing the costs downwards, nuclear energy is completing the journey from \"too cheap to meter\" to \"too expensive to count\". \"It surprises me that something that is completely obvious to people in Germany is suppressed in the UK,\" says Kraemer. A final note. I am here with half a dozen of the UK's most senior energy policy academics. When I mention the guarantee repeatedly given by the coalition government that new nuclear plants in the UK will get \"no public subsidy\", the only response are roars of incredulous laughter. Energy bill payers, who fund all the energy schemes, are unlikely to be similarly amused."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/africa-future-coal-oil-renewables-water","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-16T12:08:18Z","webTitle":"Africa can chose its future: will it be coal and oil or renewables and water?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/africa-future-coal-oil-renewables-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/africa-future-coal-oil-renewables-water","fields":{"headline":"Africa can chose its future: will it be coal and oil or renewables and water?","bodyText":"May 2013 was the 339th consecutive month of above average global temperatures and we have already breached the 400 parts per million (ppm) carbon limit that we were warned about. This must shift the focus in capital markets from short term gains toward long term consequences and give rise to the mother of all asset bubbles for carbon-producing industries. As President Obama said recently, this is no time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society. The Carbon Tracker Initiative estimates that between 50-80% of known coal, oil and fossil fuels should be left unused to prevent temperature rises over 2C, which the International Panel on Climate Change suggests is prudent. The impact on business valuations is enormous, even before another United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) sponsored report's assertion that none of the top 20 industrial regions and sectors would be profitable if environmental costs were accounted for. The report puts the unpriced natural capital cost at $7.3tn (£4.7m) a year, 10% of global GDP, a cost not presently accounted for and the biggest culprit is coal power production. These challenges represent a massive opportunity if the flow of money can be altered. Traditionally, investment houses allocate capital based on returns and do not account for the positive and negative externalities created by the businesses employing this capital. In the last few decades many financial institutions have tended to focus mainly on the demands of shareholders, to the detriment of other stakeholders, such as local communities, employees and the environment. Often projects with negative social and/or environmental impacts have received capital, while projects offering measurable benefits to society have been denied that boost. Chasing yield in the short term has often been detrimental to shareholders in the long run. Though the local banking industry dodged the sub-prime bullet, it is no stranger to asset bubbles, funding microlending, dotcom, contracts for difference, unsecured lending, property and other sectors with negative consequences. This, at the same time that social enterprises targeting sustainability outcomes as well as profit, are battling to raise capital due to perceived higher risk. But sustainability has evolved from a social movement into a market opportunity through the growth of new market options that are healthier, cleaner and more efficient. This is broader than environmentalism, encompassing social justice and economic prosperity. South Africa (correctly) trumpets the R50bn (£3.2bn) invested in the first round of the Independent Power Producer's programme aimed at delivering 20% of electricity from alternative sources by 2030, but this needs to be compared with the R300bn (£19.2bn) spent on coal fired power plants. This, at a time when both the US government and the World Bank are significantly cutting financing for coal. We need to ask what is the true cost of carbon-producing power (including externalities) and what happens when the carbon tax is introduced in 2015? Especially as the cost of alternative energy plummets. Compare this to California where all new power generation will come from renewables this year, Germany where 50% of power was delivered by renewables at a point last year and Saudi Arabia's £70bn solar power plan, and perhaps we are thinking too small. Jason Drew, one of rising breed of local ecopreneurs, talks often of Africa's potential to leapfrog the developed world by investing in future-proof technology rather than trying to catch up. In the same way that the continent skipped landline telephony and went straight to mobile (there are 700m mobile phones in Africa), we have an opportunity to take a leadership position with farsightedness, and at the same time, \"repair the future\". After all, the solar energy hitting earth in a year is 20,000 times more than the whole of humanity consumes annually, and South Africa is the third-best solar location in the world with one of the highest and most stable solar radiations. Investors are rushing to Africa, lured by new markets and consumers, resources, growth and infrastructure opportunities - at this inflection point we can choose our future by investing wisely today. Will it be in coal, mining, arms, oil, nuclear, chemicals, casinos, consumptive manufacturing or in organic farming, renewables, entrepreneurs, energy efficiency, water and affordable housing? Money is finite and on the cusp of a post-carbon revolution that could be as big as the fossil-fuel-fueled industrial revolution, with an underdeveloped infrastructure, there would be significant advantage to investing in job-intensive, clean technology that enhances food and water security as well as advancing health benefits. By de-centralising infrastructure development, governments can also empower local communities and create more resilience, modelling networks on nature. Sustainability is a mega-trend that can deliver long term competitiveness through better management of risk and incorporating the broadest notion of stakeholders. It's not a fad because the climate crisis is real, the energy crisis is permanent and new technology is changing the game. Investors are starting to care, consumer purchasing behaviour is changing and there is an appreciation that inequality, poverty and unemployment need to be addressed. Media coverage is increasing, politicians are reacting, and it's personal. If 1% of conventional global assets were to move to companies already addressing challenges in water management, ecological conservation, pollution, waste, poverty, transport alternatives, health, entrepreneurial development and innovation, that would represent 10 times total annual foreign aid. In the UK, (population: 62 million) there are over 600 alternative financial providers which move savers' monies transparently to enterprises focussed on positive outcomes as well as profitability. On the entire African continent (population: 1 billion) there are a handful. But this is changing and so it should; sustainable finance makes sense for individuals, communities, the country, continent and the planet. It also makes financial sense - even the money-men are starting to see that, and why shouldn't money be a force for good? \"Everyone can rise above their circumstances and achieve success if they are dedicated to and passionate about what they do.\" Nelson Mandela Chris is financial services strategy consultant at Moksha and founder of a sustainable finance company Water Financial This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

According to Leggett, a wide range of experts and insiders \"from diverse sectors spanning academia, industry, the military and the oil industry itself, including until recently the International Energy Agency or, at least, key individuals or factions therein\" are expecting an oil crunch \"within a few years,\" most likely \"within a window from 2015 to 2020.\" Interconnected risks Despite its serious tone, The Energy of Nations: Risk Blindness and the Road to Renaissance, published by the reputable academic publisher Routledge, makes a compelling and ultimately hopeful case for the prospects of transitioning to a clean energy system in tandem with a new form of sustainable prosperity. The five risks he highlights cut across oil depletion, carbon emissions, carbon assets, shale gas, and the financial sector: \"A market shock involving any one these would be capable of triggering a tsunami of economic and social problems, and, of course, there is no law of economics that says only one can hit at one time.\" At the heart of these risks, Leggett argues, is our dependence on increasingly expensive fossil fuel resources. His wide-ranging analysis pinpoints the possibility of a global oil supply crunch as early as 2015. \"Growing numbers of people in and around the oil industry\", he says, privately consider such a forecast to be plausible. \"If we are correct, and nothing is done to soften the landing, the twenty-first century is almost certainly heading for an early depression.\" Leggett also highlights the risk of parallel developments in the financial sector: \"Growing numbers of financial experts are warning that failure to rein in the financial sector in the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008 makes a second crash almost inevitable.\" A frequent Guardian contributor, Leggett has had a varied career spanning multiple disciplines. A geologist and former oil industry consultant for over a decade whose research on shale was funded by BP and Shell, he joined Greenpeace International in 1989 over concerns about climate change. As the organisation's science director he edited a landmark climate change report published by Oxford University Press. Industry's bad bet Leggett points to an expanding body of evidence that what he calls \"the incumbency\" - \"most of the oil and gas industries, their financiers, and their supporters and defenders in public service\" - have deliberately exaggerated the quantity of fossil fuel reserves, and the industry's capacity to exploit them. He points to a leaked email from Shell's head of exploration to the CEO, Phil Watts, dated November 2003: \"I am becoming sick and tired of lying about the extent of our reserves issues and the downward revisions that need to be done because of far too aggressive/ optimistic bookings.\" Leggett reports that after admitting that Shell's reserves had been overstated by 20%, Watts still had to \"revise them down a further three times.\" The company is still reeling from the apparent failure of investments in the US shale gas boom. Last October the Financial Times reported that despite having invested \"at least $24bn in so-called unconventional oil and gas in North America\", so far the bet \"has yet to pay off.\" With its upstream business struggling \"to turn a profit\", Shell announced a \"strategic review of its US shale portfolio after taking a $2.1bn impairment.\" Shell's outgoing CEO Peter Voser admitted that the US shale bet was a big regret: \"Unconventionals did not exactly play out as planned.\" Leggett thus remains highly sceptical that shale oil and gas will change the game. Despite \"soaring drilling rates,\" US tight oil production has lifted \"only around a million barrels a day.\" As global oil consumption is at around 90 milion barrels a day, with conventional crude depleting \"by over four million barrels a day of capacity each year\" according to International Energy Agency (IEA) data, tight oil additions \"can hardly be material in the global picture.\" He reaches a similar verdict for shale gas, which he notes \"contributes well under 1% of US transport fuel.\" Even as Prime Minister David Cameron has just reiterated the government's commitment to prioritise shale, Leggett says: \"Shale-gas drilling has dropped off a cliff since 2009. It is only a matter of time now before US shale-gas production falls. This is not material to the timing of a global oil crisis.\" In an interview, he goes further, questioning the very existence of a real North American 'boom': \"How it can be that there is a prolonged and sustainable shale boom when so much investment is being written off in America - $32 billion at the last count?\" It is a question that our government, says Leggett, is ignoring. Crunch time In his book, Leggett cites a letter he had obtained in 2004 written by the First Secretary for Energy and Environment in the British embassy in Washington, referring to a presentation on oil supply by the leading oil and gas consulting firm, PFC Energy (now owned by IHS, the US government contractor which also owns Cambridge Energy Research Associates). According to Leggett, the diplomat's letter to his colleagues in London reads as follows: \"The presentation drew some gasps from the assembled energy cognoscenti. They predict a peaking of global supply in the face of high demand by as early as 2015. This will lead to a more regionalised oil market, a key role for West African producers, and continued high and volatile prices.\" The text of the 2004 letter is corroborated by a 2009 PFC Energy report commissioned by the International Energy Forum which concluded that world conventional oil supply was approaching \"peak production, where the petroleum industry's ability to continue to increase - or even maintain - production of conventional oil (and eventually gas) is constrained... \"Exploitation of unconventional oil will provide additional liquids, but in all probability only at increasingly higher costs, and it will depend on significant investments to develop appropriate technologies to convert today's resources into tomorrow's reserves. The exact timing of both the plateau and onset of irreversible decline will be influenced by the factors that determine long-term changes in supply and demand. Nevertheless, the challenge is coming, and this emerging world of limited conventional production will require major adjustments on the part of both consumers and producers.\" Requests for comment from PFC Energy and Cuadrilla, a UK energy company, concerning Leggett's warning of a near-term oil crash despite shale gas production received no response. Critics point out that Leggett and others warning of peak oil are wrong because they never saw the prospect of shale. In response, Leggett tells me: \"Its true that the short burst of shale gas and shale oil has taken a lot of 'peakists', myself included, somewhat by surprise, and that the oil peak has been pushed out in time a little by tight oil. What hasn't changed is the basic issue: most of the incumbency says the 'all-liquids' oil production peak is many years hence, the minority doubting the narrative says it is much nearer, within this decade. And lets not forget: conventional crude oil has already peaked, as even the IEA admits.\" After his stint as Greenpeace's science chief, Jeremy Leggett went on to found the UK's largest solar energy company, SolarCentury, and to advise the British government on renewable energy from 2002 to 2006. He is now convener of the UK Industry Task Force on Peak Oil and Energy Security which includes major multinationals like Arup Group and Virgin, chairman of the Carbon Tracker Initiative which aims to improve the transparency of carbon embedded in equity markets, and a co-organiser of the Trans-Atlantic Energy Security Dialogue I reported on last January. That same month, Leggett addressed world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos about his forecast. The 2015 oil crunch forecast, Leggett writes, is corroborated by the Industry Task Force report: \"In this report we updated the evidence that defines global oil reserves and extraction rates, and concluded that the global peak production rate for oil would likely occur within the decade, very likely by 2015 at the latest – at a value no higher than 92 million barrels per day.\" Based on flow rate data, the report found that \"increases in extraction would be slowing down in 2011–13 and dropping thereafter.\" From then on, global oil production would drop \"at 1% a year from 2015. If the then IEA forecast of demand rising to 105 million barrels a day in 2030 were to prove correct, supply would fall short in 2015.\" Uncertain future The \"incumbency\", as Leggett calls it, strongly disagrees. A much-touted Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study, The Future of Natural Gas, has predicted that US gas consumption will double to 40% of the country's energy needs by 2050. Though at first glance an impressive body of interdisciplinary work, a report by the US-based Public Accountability Initiative in March last year documented \"growing evidence that the oil and gas industry\" had attempted to \"corrupt\" the process of \"academic inquiry.\" The report alleged that the MIT study was both authored and funded by oil and gas industry insiders, and as a consequence marred by \"poor scholarship.\" Other large studies of oil supply challenges which acknowledge the peak of conventional production are less specific, though. The UK Energy Research Centre, for instance, has forecasted such a peak to occur \"before 2030\" - a position backed up by more recent research published by the Royal Society. A convener of that research, however, agrees that a near-term peak is more likely than a later one. Peak oil does not mean, Leggett insists forcefully, that oil is \"running out.\" The problem is the increasing costs of extraction and decreasing flow rates of unconventionals: \"It will never run out. Oil reserves under the ground, we tried to say, once again, are not the same as oil flows from production pipes at the surface.\" The UK Industry Taskforce's pinpointing of 2015, Leggett emphasises throughout his book, is corroborated by forecasts from a range of other agencies, including the US and German militaries. UK risk blindness? Citing the cracks appearing in the US shale market, he pulls no punches about the stark consequences of what he sees as the UK government's deliberate policy to \"actively suppress renewables\": \"Picture the scene if most of the national energy eggs are put in that basket, infrastructure is capitalised, and then supplies of cheap gas fall far short of requirement, or even fail to materialise.\" I put Leggett's concerns about UK energy strategy to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), and whether they found his scenario at all plausible. A spokesperson said: \"Geological uncertainty, economic, geopolitical and environmental factors make it difficult to predict future oil reserves. The Government does not subscribe to a particular view on when oil production is likely to peak and at what level, although there is a recognition that it is inevitable that oil production will peak and then begin to decline. The Government is committed to a diverse energy mix and is investing in nuclear and renewables, which will ensure we have a secure supply of energy in the future. The lights will not go out.\" Although Jeremy Leggett's warnings put him in a minority, he is in good company. Writing in Nature in 2012, former chief government scientist Sir David King dismissed the notion that a shale gas boom could avert a coming energy crisis due to overestimated reserve sizes, rapidly declining production rates, high production costs, and insufficient profits. The good news, Leggett writes, is that the unprecedented ramifications of a post-crash economy could create exactly the kind of new social and political context that could spur massive appetite to change our ways. But in practice the crash could play out in different ways: \".... if my suppositions are correct so far – a big if – the world faces either an oil shock by the end of 2015 and a financial crash soon after, or a second financial crash before then, followed by a delayed oil crash some years later.\" Dr Nafeez Ahmed is executive director of the Institute for Policy Research &amp; Development and author of A User's Guide to the Crisis of Civilisation: And How to Save It among other books.

In 2004, five social entrepreneurs tested this idea by turning 5,000 of the 100,000 sq ft Robertson Building, an early 1900 Edwardian style structure that was once used as a manufacturing warehouse for the James Robertson Company in Toronto, into a shared workspace. The idea became a success and the demand was enormous. Individuals and organisations were put on a waiting list. By 2009, the Centre for Social Innovation (CSI) occupied more than 20,000 sq ft of the Robertson Building and then there was even more demand. When the opportunity came up to expand with another building in the heart of Toronto, there was only one problem: money. The centre had to find $6.5m (£4m) to cover the purchase and renovations for the 36,000 sq ft building. They first went to the City of Toronto and were able to secure a loan guarantee, which allowed them to shop for a better $4.5m mortgage with Alterna Savings &amp; Credit Union. This meant they still had to raise $2m. Birth of the Community Bond With a lack of money but a willing community the idea of a community bond was born. A community bond is a debt instrument that allowed CSI, the issuer of the bond, to promise its community of lenders, the holders of the bond, the principal amount borrowed plus 4% interest over five years. Because the bond was backed by an asset, bondholders could place them in their registered retirement saving plans. CSI ended up raising $1.4m in the first four months and eventually the full amount to fund what is known today as the CSI Annex. The story of CSI is not uncommon but the growth of social innovation in Canada, as exemplified by CSI's overcrowding problem, has triggered a great demand for channeling investments into initiatives that deliver a mixture of positive social and environmental impact and financial returns, often referred to as \"social investment\" or \"impact investment\". Today, CSI operates three shared workspaces in Toronto and a fourth in Manhattan, New York, that opened last month. Based on the success of the community bond and a desire to mobilise money for socially innovative projects, other organisations have created their own bonds. In December of 2011, the YWCA Toronto issued a $1m community bond to fund 300 affordable housing units for women and children. Purchased by the Muttart Foundation, the bond carries a 10-year term and pays 4% interest annually. Community bonds are also used for financing local solar energy projects and food markets. Government catches on There has been a spur of successfully operating social finance initiatives across Canada in the last few years. To name just three, the Desjardins Group has established microcredit programmes to provide individuals and entrepreneurs small interest-free loans that have two- to five-year payback periods. Provided that they agree to lessons in budgeting, employability, and starting a business, these loans are available to those who are traditionally excluded from the financial market, such as single parents, Aboriginal people living off reserve, and new Canadians. Another example, the Youth Social Innovation Capital Fund provides micro-loans and non-financial support for young social entrepreneurs to develop their ideas. There's also Resilient Capital, a $15m fund formed by a credit union, Vancity, and the Vancouver Foundation to invest in social enterprises. In fact, Resilient Capital was established with a grant from the Government of British Columbia. What's happening is that government has caught on to the notion of using social finance to build better communities. Last November, the government of Canada launched a national call for concepts to seek \"investment ready\" social finance projects to develop and expand. More than 150 submissions were received, including ideas for using social impact bonds, social investment funds, and social enterprises. Full speed ahead A 2012 report published by the Social Investment Organization estimates Canadian impact investing assets, defined as those aimed at solving social or environmental problems, are at $5.3bn, which is a 20% increase since 2010. The government of Canada vows to continue outreach, connect key players together, sharpen ideas and test social finance tools. Likewise in the UK, the development of social finance initiatives is moving full speed ahead. David Cameron took advantage of the UK presidency of the G8 to set the agenda on social investment while announcing three new major initiatives at home: tax breaks for social investment, the Social Stock Exchange, and a £250m commitment from the Big Society Capital and Big Lottery Fund to help communities buy local assets such as pubs, shops, and community centres. Social problems have \"frustrated government after government, country after country, generation after generation\", the prime minister said, \"I want to use our G8 Presidency to push this agenda forward. We will work with other G8 nations to grow the social investment market and increase investment, allowing the best social innovations to spread and help tackle our shared social and economic challenges.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The Solar Impulse, which has a wingspan longer than a Boeing 747 but weighs less than a car, is due to take off from San Francisco in May and spend two months hop-scotching across US cities until ending its tour in New York in July. The announcement was made on Thursday at a news conference at Moffett airfield, near San Francisco. Its Swiss inventors, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, hope the spectacle of the odd-looking aircraft powered by about 12,000 photovoltaic cells, allowing it to fly day and night without jet fuel, will animate debate about solar technology potential. \"Only by challenging common certitudes can there be change and, through conferences on educational themes, Solar Impulse wishes to motivate everybody to become a pioneer in the search for innovative solutions for society's biggest challenges,\" they said in a statement. Engineers are not claiming it will replace fuel-powered flight: the Solar Impulse has just one seat for the pilot, four small electric engines, cannot fly through clouds and has a top speed of 50mph. The wings are designed to create lift and space for solar cells, which fuel lithium polymer batteries. Piccard and Borschberg will take turns flying it. The Federal Aviation Authority authorised the voyage after inspecting the aircraft, also known as HB-SIA, after it was shipped from Europe in a cargo plane and reassembled in California. The journey will begin the first day in May that weather permits, said spokesperson Alenka Zibetto. The first stop will be Phoenix, followed by Dallas, then either Atlanta or St Louis, then Washington DC and New York. \"We'll be holding events in each city. We'll be taking it easy.\" Each stop will last around 10 days, with the exact timetable determined by weather. Test flights will start around the San Francisco bay from March 30. The plane's capabilities have advanced rapidly in recent years. It flew 26 hours non-stop in 2010 to show it could absorb enough solar energy during sunlight to continue during the night. In 2012 it flew 1,550 miles from Madrid to Morocco, crossing a narrow stretch of the Mediterranean, in 20 hours. Its inventors plan to fly a second prototype, the HB-SIB, around the world in 2015. \"Eleven percent larger, HB-SIB is designed to cross oceans and more humid climates from east to west in the northern hemisphere,\" according to the project's website. A carbon-fiber frame and spartan design minimises weight. A toilet is built into the pilot's seat. \"There is no heating, there's no pressurisation, so we need an oxygen mask. So, yes, it's more difficult and maybe less comfortable than flying through an airliner,\" Borschberg told NPR. \"The contact with the external world is much more intense.\" His partner Piccard is the scion of adventurers. His father Jacques was an oceanographer who set records for ocean dives. His grandfather August was the first to fly a balloon into the stratosphere. Piccard made headlines for circumnavigating the planet in a balloon in 1999. He nearly ran out of fuel, prompting interest in reducing or eliminating fuel dependency, a project he and Borschberg developed over the past decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/blog/2012/feb/24/your-views-on-the-news-solar-energy-neets","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-24T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"Your views on the news: 'neets', tightening GCSEs and opening windows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2012/feb/24/your-views-on-the-news-solar-energy-neets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/blog/2012/feb/24/your-views-on-the-news-solar-energy-neets","fields":{"headline":"Your views on the news: 'neets', tightening GCSEs and opening windows","bodyText":"Open windows in hospitals Could opening windows in hospitals help combat the spread of infections? Readers shared their views on what differences fresh air might make to the wards in response to claims from a US microbiologist. From DanielBurden: I work in a hospital and it's a stuffy and unpleasant environment. Having open windows would allow some fresh air into the constantly hot building. Better for patients and staff. engagebrain adds: A reasonable ventilation standard (Sweden) is that half the air should be replaced every hour. This is apparently at odds with need to prevent draughts, hence the use of ventilation through a heat exchanger. The heat is retained within the building, but there is decent healthy air with a low moisture content. This is not rocket science. aily77 posts: I work in a relatively modern NHS building and we have no circulation of fresh air within the building as the windows are all sealed shut. The inefficiency of the heating/air conditioning system means that patients are either stifling and sweating or shivering under reconstituted freezing air currents. The original Victorian hospital buildings may not have been fit for purpose in many ways in the modern world, but at least you could open windows and patients were easily observable, within bright airy wards. The current NHS system and buildings provide constant barriers to delivering efficient patient care to the constant frustration of myself and my colleagues. MerelyMeerkovo writes: Fresh air, and the possibility of access to it, are key to recovery and well-being. I feel ill as soon as I walk into a hospital and surely lying there unable to avoid breathing in other people's germs, and at the same time spreading your own, is not desirable. The years I worked in air-conditioned offices were the worst ever for collecting every single virus that was going round. You don't need to have a gale blowing through! People are too afraid of fresh air. I really don't see the benefits of having air-conditioning – very expensive too. Legionnaires' disease, anyone? If a wound is dressed properly, and proper techniques used when changing dressings, fresh air should not be a concern. I totally agree that surgery waiting rooms are always too hot and stuffy, which can't be good either for the staff who are stuck in there all day. I really hope somebody with some clout listens to Jack Gilbert and takes some action. Ofqual GCSE proposals What effect will Ofqual tightening up GCSEs in four subjects have on students and schools? Readers have questioned whether changes proposed by the exam regulator to GCSEs in English literature, maths, history and geography to ensure students study the whole curriculum will be sufficient. nickfoundart responds with his experience as a parent: Exams have already been \"tightened up\" at my kids' school. Every single child failed the science module, because the government in their infinite wisdom got the exam board to change the exam 1/4 way through the course. The science they are now required to learn has doubled in quantity and they are expected to answer questions in a more sophisticated way. Fine if they had been prepared but they were not. A C grade now would have been an A last year. Children in the year above are doing the old exam and will have an easier time of it. The whole system is skewed to passing exams and not learning. I have heard of children at supposedly good private schools having tutors for every subject. They are being spoon fed exam technique and \"right\" answers. When they get to university they don't have resources to function independently. deadwards42 adds: Admittedly I can only speak from the point of view of history (studying for an MA now) but specialisation is pretty much the core aspect of the subject. Why limit it? If we consider that GCSEs in such a subject are to get to A-Level and those then to get to university (rather than to appease the school's league tables) then specialisation early on is extremely useful as it teaches one to be selective and acknowledge the fact that to study \"all\" history to such a degree would be utterly futile. On the other hand however there is much to be said for the history curriculum. Whereas UK history students have a great understanding of Stalin, Hitler and WWII there is very little to be said for much of their own history, or anything beyond a political or economic level with social, military, modern British and multinational history left by the wayside. But on the view of toughening up, perhaps they have a point, I remember coasting through my GCSEs (in 2005/6) and didn't really get to revising properly until university (at a Russell Group institution). I regret not motivating myself more, but at the time I didn't need to. In reality, who is this for? The students who just miss the Oxbridge qualifications? Or those who are getting left behind? Liverpoollife writes: My experience is that the routine use of technology in classrooms has effected the pupils' experience and expectations of literature. Pupils have come to expect to be \"entertained\" with slick, bullet-pointed presentations of key texts, and too often teachers are showing film adaptations of novels before the novel itself is attempted. This can lead to misinformation and confusion, as the visual imagery of the film tends to imprint more powerfully than the words on the page of the novel. This is not the fault of individual teachers, but of the culture of education these days – with the endless tick-boxes relating to the skills, knowledge and aptitudes, which are expected to be \"covered\" during an individual lesson or scheme of work. Teachers and pupils get lost in this process, and the absorption and engagement with literature is lost in a haze of metaphors, similes, key themes, inferences, main-plots, sub-plots, characterisation … Of course all of the above are key to an understanding of literature, but the overly rigid systemisation that is applied in schools these days, inevitably results in teachers teaching to the system. When I was at school – a grammar school in the 1970s/1980s – I cannot recall such a systematic teaching of the elements of literature. Not at GCSE level, anyway! Nick Clegg and 'neets' Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg's announcement of a £126m scheme to get 16- and 17-year-olds back into employment or education was a talking point for readers this week. Sparebulb says: I disagree entirely. I am attempting to start my own business but the underlying issue is the lack of finance available to small start-ups. If that changed I'd give these teenagers a chance, and the money incentive would help. These people aren't idiots, they can develop into productive individuals and often have more realistic expectations than a graduate LaserX posts: This is really important stuff. The waste of young lives is unacceptable. Work is essential if these young people are to retain any dignity and contribute to society. If someone reaches 25 and has not been in employment, there must be a good chance that they will be a long-term burden on society. I suspect that rather more money is needed, directed not just at these youngsters but at providing tax relief and encouragement to the businesses that will employ them, in stimulating investment in industry, and in providing relevant training. While some of these people will be good, there are others who have limited skills/motivation and support will be required to get them into work. I know that we have limited money, but this is high priority. I'd cut virtually anywhere – even the NHS – to provide the required funding. DaveAboard contributes: In theory, any scheme which aims to address unemployment, regardless of age, is to be welcomed. As usual, though, this merely massages a small part of the affected area whilst allowing the main wound to continue haemorrhaging. As usual, I see no evidence that the handful of young people who are eligible will come out with a marketable skill or a job. This just strikes me as Welfare to Work Mark II. The CBI are still complaining that their members cannot access appropriate skills when justifying opposing the immigrant cap. Well, here is an opportunity for those employers to train youngsters to address this supposed skills deficit whilst allowing someone else to foot the bill, but we know this won't happen. This will be just more short-term no-skill no-job numbers fiddling. osbournecox adds: It's not clear to me what \"take young people on\" means. Are the charities and companies bidding for contracts for intensive support and training, or for funding to subsidise specific jobs? If the former, why not improve the current support mechanisms and put back the money that was slashed? If the latter, haven't these schemes already been discredited enough in the last week? wigglylines comments: Several of my acquaintances who have their own businesses have indicated that they would take on young people to learn the business BUT the cost of regulations, minimum wage etc prohibits them from doing so in these days of pressures within their sphere of business. Have a look at Wikipedia to see who is second from the top in minimum wage league: right! UK. I am not against a living minimum wage but the benefit culture has driven the tax system to a point of bleeding everything dry to fund it (£200bn). The more you put up tax the more join the unemployment queue. It then becomes a self feeding downward spiral and unemployment is one of the unintended consequences. From DanielNortonSmith writes: It's interesting. As a small employer I was looking to take on a young person. The sticking point was that the skills agency only trained the young people in company governance and customer service – two very broad bases. They wouldn't change their position and wouldn't send me a young person. From lurkio88 posts: Can't believe some of the naive thoughts towards young people here. At 16 I hated school to the point where FE was the last thing I wanted to do. However, getting a job was near on in possible, having no GCSEs. The support the government offered was next to useless. It was only thanks to a member of my family I was able to get into work and experience the real world. This gave me a deep understanding of what I wanted to do with my life. This way, I ended back into FE and just about to finish my degree. The job I took had nothing in common with job I plan to go into. But hell I learned a lot. So it's nice to see the government have acknowledged this. From my experience, these young workers don't only need the job, they need support and guidance through the course of the job away from the employer. People enrolled in FE have access to this kind of support. Now Connexions has been closed they will have no where to turn for emotional support, and remember, not everybody feels comfortable in turning to their family for it. Abizmal shares some personal experience: I am in the same boat: 52 years old, worked and paid my way all my working life. I was made redundant last year, now living on my rapidly diminishing savings. If this situation carries on for much longer then, quite soon, I will be destitute. Solar panel milestone Mixed reactions to news that solar as a UK energy source has now passed the 1,000MW mark, buoyed by the growth in solar panel installations on homes, schools and fields in the past 22 months. RalphRoger voices support: And if we can eventually generate a significant proportion of national demand through domestic installation, then clearly a properly constructed international grid connected to industrial suppliers in the world's desert regions will be able meet long-term global demand. It appears to defy all logic not to see solar generation as the long-term solution – which we have to plan for now. And it appears also to be only politics getting in the way. Bluecloud adds: A ray of sunshine appears from behind a cloud of uncertainty about the fate of the FIT. One gigawatt is of course not much compared to Germany's 25 gigawatts, so Britain has a long way to go yet. The reason for this is the late start and the lack of clarity about the FIT once it did get going. The price of PV has also plummeted in recent years with a 50% drop since 2006. Prices for wind are also falling, unlike the cost of oil and the damage it is doing to the planet. Baldeagle11 takes a deeper look: Leaving aside the important matter of the amount of government subsidy for those who have, or plan to install, roof-mounted electrovoltaic solor panels, would it not be more effective in increasing the base of residential installation to set a new standard for all new-build residential units by regulating a standard to cover the minimum and maximum installation required for subsidy, and another standard for modern conversions? As obviously the latter case involves more work in modernisation the subsidy could be greater than the former for new builds. Moreover, a new set of standards should encourage better and more economic production techniques and fitment costs in the solar panel supply sector. Finally, bringing the individual electrical consumer closer to cost savings can be allied by the end of subsiding network builders, and purely profit-orientated third-party residential photovoltaic builder/networking//operators. Solar panel installation firm freesource adds: There will always be critics of subsidies, sadly there is no perfect world either way. The fact remains all renewable technology needs some form of assistance, just like many other beneficial technologies did in our history in other markets. Without the early investors (the so-called middle-class rich by some critics), PV would not be available at the prices it is now The fact remains, people are scared, they need ways to get fuel security and this technology can help them. To get it off the ground requires a leg up, which is what FIT has been successfully doing. We do need some balance though and getting the energy efficiency piece right is crucial, along with heating solutions.

I sometimes wonder if this government, which seems so wilfully short-sighted when it comes to good opportunities, shares the same problem. The UK solar industry, currently standing at a crossroads, is a case in point. At a meeting on solar power organised by the Renewable Energy Association in parliament last week, we saw strong evidence – including in a recent report by Ernst and Young (pdf) – that solar has huge potential to deliver affordable and secure energy, and can play a significant role in the decarbonisation of our economy. But if the government sticks with its policy of slashing support for large-scale solar projects, the potential for the industry to flourish here in the UK will be completely undermined. In its review of the responses to the feed-in tariffs (Fits) consultation, the government admits that while changes to Fits may have a negative impact on investor confidence in both the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector and other renewable energy sectors, it is determined to make them because \"the need for fiscal responsibility across all areas of government spending is a key objective of the coalition government.\" From the outset, the government has looked at feed-in tariffs throughthe wrong end of the telescope. It has asked how little it could get away with spending in the short term and worked forwards from there – rather than looking ahead to the huge benefits that could come from significant investment, and working backwards. Ministers are completely wrong to argue that the Fits programme has become an expensive measure that needs to be controlled. In the first year of the feed-in tariff, the actual spend on the scheme was only £11m. And that is not £11m just for solar – it is £11m for all technologies. They are also wrong to suggest that Fits are adding unacceptably to energy bills. While I would prefer to see support for solar and other renewables coming from general taxation instead of from levies on bills, I do think it is important to keep things in perspective. Last year, the cost of the solar Fit on a typical household energy bill was less than 1p per month. And the forecast cost of the domestic levy for all renewables support in this financial year is £1 – or just 0.08% of a typical household energy bill. And the irony is that in opposition, current members of the government criticised the last government for its \"modest\" PV Fit scheme. The Liberal Democrats, in particular, went into the last election promising to triple the ambition of Labour's offer – saying Labour weren't doing enough. Yet now the government wants to do even less. The evidence in favour of a different approach is overwhelming; with the right investment now, solar power can be cheaper, or at least no more expensive than average energy to produce (so-called grid parity), in the UK within a few years – and in countries with better-supported solar industries, much sooner than that. The strength of feeling against the changes is clear – 81% of respondents to the Fit review disagreed with the proposed reduction of support for solar, and all respondents who commented on the largest PV generation band felt that the proposed tariff would not provide sufficient incentive for any installations at this scale. This is bad news for jobs, bad news for the economy and bad news for the environment. Because despite our famously unreliable weather, the UK receives very similar levels of irradiation (sunlight) to Germany – which now employs 100,000 people in its solar industry (around 10 times the number employed in the UK). Ernst and Young's analysis clearly shows that our government is putting similar potential benefits for the UK at risk. It is particularly frustrating that the government's advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, has failed to appreciate the worth of a more dynamic approach, arguing instead that solar power remains too expensive in the short term and that the UK should instead buy in renewable power from overseas later. Compare this with the huge financial support that has been given to nuclear for decades. The government is so committed to reviving nuclear in the UK that the Commons energy and climate change select committee recently warned that the government risks distorting its planned reform of the entire electricity market . Solar power has had a fraction of the support that nuclear has received over many years. In the short term, a gap remains between costs and returns: profitability is not currently possible without Fit support. Which means that fast-tracked reviews and slash-and-burn policies simply scare off many investors. Given the potential of the solar industry to speed the UK's transition to a sustainable economy, hopefully the government will reconsider its solar policy. This would be yet another coalition U-turn that I would welcome."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2013/apr/07/housing-only-developers-gain","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-06T23:05:40Z","webTitle":"Housing: lots of new homes are going up, but only the developers gain | the big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/apr/07/housing-only-developers-gain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2013/apr/07/housing-only-developers-gain","fields":{"headline":"Housing: lots of new homes are going up, but only the developers gain","bodyText":"You live in cloud cuckoo land (\"We need to have more homes: so why aren't we building enough?\", News). The Campaign to Protect Rural England here is vociferous in its support of more affordable housing. Property prices in Salcombe, bloated by absentee bankers' bonuses and where a shed on the quay sells for £100,000, have driven local people out to the extent that recruiting firemen and lifeboatmen is a critical problem. Fifteen miles away near Plymouth we have been forced to have a massive new town. Originally, it was to be 50% affordable housing, but the developers pleaded poverty and got this down to 17%. Now the government states that if affordable housing provision holds back building houses then they can be omitted altogether. So who will buy these unaffordable houses? Chinese investors are already sniffing. CPRE is also accused of being nimby about wind and solar energy. Not so. We fully endorse the NFU policy of encouraging us farmers to generate as much electricity as possible from wind, rain and sometimes sun and our muck. We do not support massive black blankets and white elephants that provide no local employment and do nothing to slow our blind acceleration towards the energy cliff. These are cash cows for opportunists that only add to fuel poverty. If you really wish to identify a nimby, ask a board member of Taylor Woodrow to build affordable housing at the bottom of his garden. Bob Harvey Chairman, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Plymouth and South Hams Perhaps your feature could have considered what is happening in market towns across the country. Faringdon, Oxfordshire, where I live is one such example. A recent new housing estate has put severe pressure on local services such as education and health. The drafts of the new local and neighbourhood plans propose another 350 homes using a greenfield site. It is widely accepted locally that this is inevitable, so we are talking neither nimbyism nor \"rural romance\" here. Meanwhile, as these plans are at the draft stage and going through a consultation process, the town is being bombarded with additional speculative planning applications, which our local authority has said it cannot oppose due to changes in the planning law that came into effect last week. It's developers, not local people or their elected representatives, who are dictating the future of our town and who are destroying our environment in the process. Joanna Cave Faringdon Oxfordshire I drive from Hertford to Cambridge, 34 miles up the A10. Leave Hertford, where new houses are being squeezed into every square metre of available space – brownfield sites having new houses built right up to the road boundaries, old houses being demolished to build two or more in the same space; the pressure on the infrastructure will cause parking problems, traffic jams and delays; there will be increased pressure on schools and other services. I pass Ware – the story is much the same. Bypass Buntingford, where houses are being built to fill the space between the town and the bypass.Through Royston, new houses are coming out to the town limits, again filling land between the town and the main roads. Cambridge – the extent of new house building is incredible, reaching from the city centre out to the M11 motorway that skirts the city. Based on my cursory observation, there is nothing but house building going on, so who is kidding whom? Are the media ill-informed, repeating the government's mantra? Is the construction industry understating the number of new homes being built to gain financial concessions and incentives to build more? Are developers understating the numbers to put pressure on local authorities to pass their plans? Is the government understating the numbers to justify the relaxation of planning control? I really feel that we are not getting the full story here.

The report, produced by the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), said America's shift from coal to gas had produced important climate gains. Carbon dioxide emissions fell last year to their lowest point since 1994, according to the Department of Energy. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions were 12% below 2005 levels. But the report said those reductions were not enough, on their own, to escape the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. They were also being offset by a sharp rise in methane, the most powerful greenhouse gas on a human timescale, that was being released into the atmosphere at well sites, compressor stations and along pipelines. Methane is up to 105 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas on a 20-year timescale. \"We have to deal with the methane emissions – whether they are large, which I think is unlikely, or whether they are small,\" said Eileen Claussen, president of C2ES, a Washington DC thinktank. \"Natural gas is a big benefit right now, and you can see it in our emissions. But it doesn't mean that left to our own natural devices it would be a great thing in 2050 because it wouldn't be – unless you did some form of carbon capture.\" Claussen was also concerned that cheap natural gas would crowd out wind and solar energy. America's gas boom has posed one of the most divisive in-house issues for environmental groups. The availability of cheap natural gas has retired a number of old, and highly polluting coal-fired powered plants. Natural gas emits half as much carbon dioxide as coal when used to make electricity. Some 29% of America's electricity came from natural gas last year – compared to just 14% a decade ago, the report said. But it comes at a high cost to the local environment, because of the risks to air and water quality posed by hydraulic fracturing. There is also a growing body of evidence that the release of methane gas from well sites and pipelines is far higher than previously thought. Methane is a far more powerful gas than carbon dioxide, even though it persists in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time. The report said natural gas could help wean America off coal and oil. But natural gas was still a fossil fuel, and was not a long-term substitute, it noted. \"Substitution of natural gas for other fossil fuels cannot be the sole basis for long-term US efforts to address climate change because natural gas is a fossil fuel and its combustion emits greenhouse gases,\" the report said. America would have to move towards zero-carbon energy, such as wind, solar and nuclear energy, the report said. The report also urged development of carbon capture technologies. It said more research was needed to measure greenhouse gas emissions from methane along the entire natural gas production chain. The report adds to growing evidence of the down sides of America's natural gas boom – beyond the widely reported contamination of local wells by chemicals used in the process of hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\". Now a consensus seems to be slowly emerging that methane emissions have to be taken into account when assessing the real climate benefits of the switch to natural gas. Dr Michael Webber, the University of Texas researcher who contributed to the report, said natural gas remained a net gain for the climate. \"I am hoping that the takeaway is that natural gas is a step in the right direction – but not the final step,\" he said. Others argued that more ambition was required. \"It is very much setting the bar too low just comparing it to coal,\" said James Bradbury, an analyst at the World Resources Institute. \"Half as much carbon dioxide compared to coal is a big improvement, but is it good enough to get us to where we need to go in terms of climate? The answer is no.\" And some environmentalists and scientists have dismissed the possibility of any climate gains for natural gas because of methane leaks. Anthony Ingraffea, a Cornell University engineer and co-author of one of the first studies flagging up methane leaks from natural gas, said it was a mistake to incorporate natural gas into a climate change plan. \"It is a wash. It is not enough of a benefit to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to expand natural gas when that money could be put to use in deployment of renewables,\" he said. • This article was amended on 5 June 2013 to better reflect Dr Webber's involvement with the report. This article was further amended on 7 June 2013 to clarify that methane persists in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time than carbon dioxide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/live/2015/nov/30/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-meet-for-opening-day-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-30T20:17:29Z","webTitle":"World leaders call for action at Paris climate talks – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/live/2015/nov/30/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-meet-for-opening-day-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/live/2015/nov/30/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-meet-for-opening-day-live","fields":{"headline":"World leaders call for action at Paris climate talks – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for joining, that’s all for today. Check back here for continued coverage of the UN climate change conference in Paris. Though world leaders have finished making their statements at today’s session, protestors are out in London. The Guardian’s Emma Howard is at the scene: Down at St Pancras in London a flashmob organised by Art COP21 is taking place in front of the Eurostar terminal where UK delegates leave for Paris. First up is a performance from beatboxer Shlomo. Katy Jetnil-Kijiner, teacher and poet from the Marshall Islands, a small island state threatened by sea rises recited ‘Dear Matafele Peinem’ a poem written for her daughter. And a flashmob choir performed ‘Kiss from a rose’ outside St Pancras station, where delegates to COP21 are leaving for Paris The session has concluded for the day. Guardian Australia political editor Lenore Taylor writes on what the pledges mean for the future: But even though the mood was optimistic and the words were full of purpose, the attention of the 40,000 assembled officials and media drifted a bit when each leader got down to the details of exactly what their country was actually doing – even at the beginning when there were still plenty of them watching. And that’s the danger. The pledges made so far will still result in global warming of at least 2.7 degrees, even if they are all met – much better than the 5C rise we might expect without action but still short of the 2C goal. Experience suggests there is a very big “if”, and negotiators have virtually given up on the idea that the pledges should be legally binding. Shirkers will face no real sanction, other than international opprobrium. And that means a system to check and report what each country does is critical. But the rules for monitoring remain unfinished. The plans to regularly review and “ratchet” up the pledges to contain global warming to 2C or lower are not finalised either and will be critical. Developing countries argue they still need more finance. Those details matter. Video of David Cameron’s appeal to other world leaders, asking ‘what would we tell our grandchildren if we fail to agree on a deal?’ Masoumeh Ebtekar, vice president of Iran, said that the organization should assess the relationship between conflict and climate change. “I wish to urge the UN system to initiate an assessment on the carbon footprints of war, conflicts, security and terrorism,” Ebtekar said. “Those perpetuating conflicts are in fact accomplices of the global warming process.” Ebtekar also said that the immediate needs of developing nations must be addressed as they continue to suffer the damage of climate change. She concluded by quoting the Qu’ran: We did not create the heavens and earth but in truth he raised the heaven and established the balance so that you would not transgress the balance. Give just weight – do not skimp in the balance. He laid out the Earth for all living creatures. “If we are against nuclear energy and want to be more independent of fossil fuels, we have to invest in renewable energy,” said Werner Faymann, chancellor of Austria. “All nations, big and small economies, developing and industrialized nations, are committed to tackling climate change,” he said. Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, said that one element is essential to responding to the climate crisis - technology. He called for continued investments in sustainable technology and said that addressing the crisis requires a global solution. Israel is committed to those goals and will act accordingly and in deed and in word to fulfill them… We must learn to do more with less and Israel is a small country with big ideas. I believe it is not enough that we have those ideas or apply them only to our country, we are eager to share them with you. Karim Massimov, prime minister of Kazakhstan, said that the country is investing heavily in energy efficient initiatives and aims to decrease emissions 25% by 2030. He urged countries to reach a collective agreement on how to address climate change. “Ladies and gentlemen, if human history has told us anything, it’s that what we can understand what we fix,” Massimov said. “We understand that climate change is a grave threat to humankind.” Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven commented on David Cameron’s earlier speech at the summit. David Cameron has made a passionate appeal to fellow world leaders for a robust climate deal. The prime minister must now persuade his Chancellor to support it with real action back home. The UK’s pioneering climate targets and the recent coal phase-out plan show that where Britain leads other countries follow. But we need to see the same UK leadership in the race to develop and invest in renewable technologies. This is what Britain’s leading businesses, scientists, and the government’s own advisers are urging Cameron to do - he should listen. India’s prime minister Narendra Modi just concluded his statement, which called on developed countries to adhere to their pledge to provide $100bn annually to developing nations by 2020. The prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint and the world’s billions, while countries at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow. So the choices are not easy... Democratic India must grow rapidly to meet the aspirations of 1.25 billion people – 300 million of whom are without access to energy. We are determined to do so, guided by an ancient belief that people and planet are inseparable, that human well being and nature are indivisible. Perry G Christie, prime minister of the Bahamas said climate change: “threatens the very existence of the Bahamas as we know it”. He pushed for a more aggressive response to climate change, arguing that countries should aim to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees celsius, instead of the two degrees goal many countries support. “The Bahamas is now more vulnerable to climate change than the history of our country,” Christie said. He cited Hurricane Joaquin as a key example of what climate change is doing to his country. The storm caused $100mn damage to the central and southern islands, which amounts to nearly 10% of the country’s national budget. Christie said: The Bahamas and other small developing island states are seeing unprecedented drought, extreme weather events, accelerating sea level rise and other life threatening impacts and the science tells us we can only expect more intense impacts over time” Like other EU leaders, Sweden’s prime minister Stefan Löfven emphasized the need for energy innovations that can combat climate change and improve the economy. “I want Swedish companies to develop the new innovations that the world is asking for,” Löfven said. He said the country would continue to provide “substantial funds” to aid for countries that do not have the resources to respond to the effects of climate change, but are enduring its negative effects. Löfven said: Sweden is ready to enter into an ambitious, durable and fair agreement. Our main concern is to keep global warming under the two degree celsius limit. Let’s not see Paris as an end but as a beginning.” Miro Cerar, prime minister of Slovenia, said his country stands by the EU position on climate change and would abide by its conditions. Cerar concluded by quoting former US president Dwight Eisenhower: As we peer into society’s future, we – you and I, and our government – must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. “Today, more than 50 years later, it is high time to heed this warning,” said Cerar Irakli Garibashvili, prime minister of Georgia, said his country is a leader in responding to climate change. He said that the country is especially susceptible to its effects because of the topography, which is prone to mudslides and floods. Flooding killed 19 people in the capital city, Tbilisi, in June. Garibashvili said that the country has mainstreamed climate change into other national strategies, but believes that world leaders need to reach an international agreement. “I cannot underscore more the importance of reaching such an agreement,” said Garibashvili. “And failing to agree, in a sense, would be agreeing to fail.” Malcolm Turnbull’s announcement that Australia will ratify the second comittment period of the Kyoto protocol – which started in 2013 and runs to 2020 – is window dressing and entirely meaningless when it comes to emissions. Australia submitted targets under Kyoto in 2012, even though they had not formally signed up. So this is just a bit of paperwork. Under Kyoto, Australia can do very little and still meet their targets because they get massive credits from land use change and forestry. More worrying is what Australia has planned for after Kyoto, its commitment to the potential Paris deal was branded “inadequate” by Climate Action Tracker. Ahead of the summit, activists in New York looked to build ground support for global action on the environment. “It’s almost too late,” said one demonstrator over the weekend. Emilie Martel with more: Malcolm Bligh Turnbull, prime minister of Australia, announces that they will ratify the second commitment period of the Kyoto agreement. From Australia we come with confidence and optimism. We are not daunted by our challenge ... we do not doubt the implications of the science. He notes Australia’s INDC: to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% of 2005 by 2030. Turnbull says that this “represents real economic effort and will halve per capita emissions, one of the biggest reductions of any G20 country”, although some have expressed scepticism that the prime minister will implement the necessary policies. Turnbull adds that Australian universities are at the forefront of solar energy innovation. He continues: Our task is not just to reduce emissions, the impacts of global warming are already being felt ... Adapting to the impacts of climate change is equally important and there too innovation is key. Some of the most vulnerable nations are our neighbours and we are helping them to build resilience. Our agreement in Paris must provide a common platform for action. Australia is not daunted by the challenge. With great optimisim and faith in humanity’s genius for invention we are confident that with collective leadership we will with common cause secure our future. The Fossil of the Day award – a prize handed out at climate conferences for most regressive country – goes to New Zealand, whose prime minister John Key met the Friends of Fossil Fuel Subsidy reform on Monday. His government’s cuts to subsidies on fossil fuel energy have become the stuff of legend. The government now underwrites no fossil fuel energy. But Fossil of the Day organiser Dan Ilic says: “While New Zealand has abolished subsidies on the consumption side, during the time that the Key party has been in office, subsidies for the production of fossil fuels have gone up over seven times. Seven times! “New Zealand provides over $80m in production subsidies for fossil fuel industries. To New Zealand that’s a lot of money. In New Zealand $80m can buy New Zealand.” New Zealand will share the award with Belgium, which the organisers said had lagged behind on its pre-2020 commitments to reduce emission. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi will soon announce a new global alliance of 120 countries committed to the largescale expansion of solar power, my colleague Arthur Neslen reports. India will initially invest $90m, it is reported, with support coming from many countries in the tropics as well as some European countries and businesses. French climate ambassador Laurence Tubiana has called the programme “a true game changer”. Ikililou Dhoinine, president of the Comoros, an archipelago island nation in the Indian Ocean is up. He calls for greater support for developing countries and those vulnerable to climate change: We are not able to finance basic investments as a result of our modest resources. It is key for funds need to be dispersed...in a more balanced way between adaptation and mitigation. We must accept the reality that climate change is progressing more quickly than international climate change negotiations. We must therefore act differently. Time is running out. The entire world is placing its hope in us. This is the only chance we have to save our planet so let us seize the opportunity before it is too late. As the leaders keep reminding themselves, the eyes of the world are on Paris. It turns out that eyes of astronauts out in the International Space Station are also upon them ... Tuvalu’s president, Enele Sosene Sopoaga, is calling for a ‘loss and damage’ mechanism in the Paris climate deal. That’s highly unlikely to make it in, given rich countries view such a proposal, a sort of climate compensation, as a dangerous blank cheque. My colleague Karl Mathiesen has unpicked the issue of loss and damage in-depth here. Former US vice-president Al Gore has welcomed Obama and Xi’s speeches earlier: Another well-known American, Bill Gates, is at the Paris climate summit today for part of an initiative putting billions of dollars into clean energy. More on that in our story here. This is a great photo of Obama and Putin meeting earlier in the halls of the summit. The body language says it all. Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo has taken the floor. His country is the fifth largest emitter in the world and the fourth most populous country, consisting of 17,000 islands, where 60% of citizens live in coastal areas. Indonesia has suffered this year from the impact of forest fires that started in July and have engulfed much of the country in toxic air pollution. The CO2 emitted by the fires alone have exceeded the annual emissions of countries such as Japan and Germany. As a country with one of the largest forest areas acting as the lungs of the world, Indonesia is here today as part of the solution. We are developing Indonesia in a way giving due attention to the environment. Indonesia has committed to reduce its emission by 29% below a business as usual scenario and by 41% with assistance from developed countries. But it has been criticised by environmentalists for being too vague on setting out how it will tackle the issue of deforestation. Widodo says they will achieve their ambitions through reallocating fossil fuel subsidies, increasing the proportion of renewables in the energy mix to 23% by 2025 and by converting waste to energy. He recalls that the government has established a moratorium on new permits for peat land – sought after by companies looking to create new plantations, for example for palm oil. The Paris agreement must be long term, ambitious and not impede development in developing countries. All parties must contribute more in mitigation and adaptation ... for developed countries through mobilisation of $100bn US to be increased over the years. Reaching a Paris agreement is a must and I expect all of us to make earth a comfortable place for our future generation a comfortable place to live in.” After lunch all my notes have been scratched up, says Micronesia’s president, Peter M Christian, who is giving one of the more moving, improvised and occasionally inscrutable speeches today. “But of course you’ve heard this before ...,” he says, before riffing on several previous speeches. Today we heard a great leader said we have come to challenge ourselves. But this challenge is to save ourselves, not someone else. I also heard another great leader say the economy had grown but the carbon emissions had stayed flat. What I would give for that flatness to dip a little bit during my lifetime. Someone else said that by 2030... ladies and gentlemen there are island states that may not be there by 2030. .... Two days ago in Paris someone asked me with genuine concern in his manner if the people of Pacific knew about climate change. I said many of my people do know the Earth as a planet among stars, they only know their world is made up of islands and surrounding seas. We have lied to them that sea level rise is a gradual rise of the future and the child asks their grandfather ‘why’. ... I ask that we mark this spot in our efforts, in Paris, not with a simple dot, but put a stone there, to make it a milestone in our effort. It is important to note we have come so far, to sit in Paris under a tree, on how to slow down and stop damages to our climate. Let us simply say that no fingers are pointed, for each of us did what we needed to do to support our way of life ... Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, president of Kenya, says his country contributes just 0.1% of global emissions but has laid out its climate plan which envisages an expansion in solar, geothermal and wind power to help cut Kenya’s emissions. “Kenya will continue to be guided by the UNFCCC ... and we look forward to an ambitious Paris climate change agreement ...” Christopher J Loeak, president of the Marshall Islands, wins the prize for most colourful outfit of any leader so far. He says: The climate we have known over many centuries has in a matter of three short decades, changed dramatically, before our very eyes. We are already limping from climate disaster to climate disaster and we know that there is worse to come. For us, COP21 must be a turning point in history. And one that gives us hope. Our Paris agreement must set a path to the safe climate future we all strive for. We all know that the targets on the table now are not enough to limit warming to below 1.5C. Although they are a start in the right direction. Therefore if it is to deliver the end we all seek, the Paris agreement must be designed for ambition. It must send a message to the world that if we are to win the battle against climate change, the fossil fuel era must end ... He calls for renewable energy instead of fossil fuels, and says the Paris deal must review targets every five years. “My country is in its hour of need,” he says. “Today I have been presented with a petition from 3.6 million people from around the world, who stand with us on this quest,” he says holding up a piece of paper saying ‘100% clean [energy, presumably]’. “This is a time for human solidarity, but it also a time for action, for us to be the leaders we were elected to be. Let’s get it done.” The Philippines bear a disproportionate amount of the burden of climate change, says President Benigno S Aquino III, who calls himself the head of a nation “affected by the new normal”. He calls for the conference to recognise the future of small island states and vulnerable countries, by providing more climate finance. The fight against climate change is a matter of survival... We are indeed hard pressed to build back better in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan. The Philippines is aiming to plant 1.5bn trees by next year, which would save 30m tonnes of carbon annually. He says that renewables account for 33% of their energy mix. We are willing to share experience and knowledge. We are ready to do our part if other nations demonstrate support. He’s mentioned Copenhagen. The conference must move beyond recrimination and learn from the past. “In this effort no one is exempt, all must contribute.” John P Key, prime minister of New Zealand, announces his government is giving $20m for a programme to help reduce emissions from agriculture and $200m for climate-related support for its nearby Pacific island nations. New Zealand faces unique domestic challenges, he says, with almost 80% of electricity already coming from renewables, but around half of country’s emissions are from agriculture, for which there are not cost effective solutions “While New Zealand’s emisisons are small on a global scale, we are determined to make a strong contribution to the international effort,” he says. Idriss Déby Itno, president of Chad in west Africa calls for action to save Lake Chad, which has shrunk to a tiny proportion of its size 50 years ago. “This basin that supports 30 million people directly is threatened now from disappearing,” he said. He calls for more robust action for the Sahel, “whose population is among the most vulnerable to climate change.” “This meeting and summit must find the necessary commitment to protect the environment and the future of the human race,” he says. “I think there are better chances [here in Paris than at previous climate summits] ... I get the sensation that there is going to be some development,” says Sir David Attenborough, who is at the Paris summit. He added he hopes the price of renewable power will become cheaper than coal. The naturalist and broadcaster has previously given his backing to an Apollo programme-style project to increase R&amp;D spending in clean energy. Alassane Ouattara, president of Côte d’Ivoire, says his government does not want a minimal agreement. “Paris is giving us a historic opportunity, let us grab that opportunity for future generations. Long live COP21, long live humanity,” he says. Nigeria will commit to emissions cuts of 20% unconditional and 45% conditional on support, below a business as usual scenario by 2030. Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari has announced his country’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted to the UN shortly before the conference. Buhari says Nigeria will meet this by making more use of natural gas and climate smart agriculture, energy efficiency measures and investment in renewable energy. He calls for developed countries to honour their promises in relation to providing climate finance to help developing countries such as his own adapt to and mitigate climate change. “The Paris agreement must be legally binding and results orientated; a fair multilateral and rules based regime,” he says. Also calls for for means to review and monitor the progress. Mahmoud Abbas, president of Palestine, has just finished speaking. He said: “The question of climate change has become challenge to countries all over the world ... the state of Palestine has taken a number of practical and serious steps to combat climate change.” He adds that Palestine has “made great progress to adopt necessary laws” but states that “the continued Israeli occupation and violation of international laws related to the environment is one of the main challenges. Our resources being usurped, our trees are being uprooted, our agriculture is being destroyed.” “We cannot continue with implementation of agreements alone. This meeting is held today 68 year after resolution 181 was adopted that partitioned historical Palestine.” He calls on the international community to expand and enhance participation to create peace and thanks countries that recognise the state of Palestine. Issoufou Mahamadou, president of Niger, says: “The leaders of all nations of the world are here to talk about one thing: to protect our common good, the planet Earth.” The effects of climate change in many countries are already quite tangible, including in Niger, where we have periods of drought, followed by floods, leading to serious losses and seriously trying the resilience of people. The countries of the Sahel expect from the north a strong signal of their commitments ... He cites hydropower as one of the technologies Niger is using to cut emissions, and says it’s planting trees as well. In the UK, shadow climate change secretary Lisa Nandy has issued a statement hours before Cameron is due to speak in Paris, saying: World leaders arriving in Paris today must grasp the opportunity to secure, for the first time, a truly international climate agreement. While it is clear that the deal being negotiated will not yet be sufficient to prevent dangerous levels of temperature rise, the summit should establish a clear pathway to build a carbon neutral economy within a generation. Ultimately this will be the key test of whether the Paris summit succeeds. Anote Tong, president of Kiribati, a low-lying, Pacific island state and outspoken leader on climate change, is up now. “As we stand in unity with France against the violence that took place here, we must also stand untied against perhaps the greatest threat against humanity: climate change, that poses a danger to all of us but especially to hose of us on the frontline of climate change, the low-lying atoll countries,” he says. He welcomes “powerful” speeches made by other leaders earlier today. I believe that that should be the moral question ... it is my belief that for any measure of success to be achieved here in Paris we must approach the discussions over the next few days as global leaders, let us not bring our national political agendas on to an issue that is global in nature. The future of people, men, women and children, whole cultures, whole communities, villages, cities and nations, hangs in the balance. We must not remain indecisive on the way forward. For those of us whose very survival is at stake, our plea is very simple: let us give substance to the pledges that have been made ... let us not pay lip service to an urgent and pressing issue. He says any Paris climate deal must be legally-binding, and repeated his recent call for a moratorium on new coal mines. “It’s so heartening to hear that Fiji has undertaken to accommodate our people of Kiribati in the event that climate change renders our homes uninhabitable,” he tells fellow leaders. That appears to be a new announcement. Read Karl Mathiesen’s story here to find out more about how climate change is affecting Kiribati. It was 1965 when the Whitehouse first acknowledged the threat of climate change. Fast forward 50 years to a year of concerted action on the issue by US president Barack Obama, with an announcement or event related to climate change occurring every four days. Guardian US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg takes a look at the 12 steps the US has taken to start to break its fossil fuel addiction “The environmental challenges facing us are enormous,” says Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, president of Mauritania. Desertification and coastal erosion are two of the biggest threats to his country, he says. “The challenge of climate change requires that we limit by the year 2100 the increase in temperatures to 2C, so we need to reach an agreement, we need a legally-binding instrument ... to reach this goal, requires a sprit of solidarity and sacrifice.” Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, president of Turkey is now up: Thanks the hosts for holding the conference “at such a trying time”. The international community is on the verge of a new era in combating climate change ... We all need to do our part to successfully conclude negotiations in the next two weeks ... The issue that needs to be clarified first and foremost is differentiation. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set out in the convention should be maintained. Calls for mitigation and adaptation to be be addressed equitably. “Responsibility should be assumed by developed countries.” Innocent people here in Paris were murdered in cold blood, says Serbia’s president, Tomislav Nikolić. But life and freedom triumphed again, he says of France persevering with the climate talks despite the 13 November attacks. He says Serbia is committed to tackling climate change, though his government’s climate plan submitted earlier this year was derided because it appeared to actually allow for a rise in carbon emissions, rather than a cut. The president of Nauru Baron Waqa, an equatorial small island state, is the first to speak after the break in room two. He represents the smallest nation state in the UN, one of the most remote places in the world. He said: “Small island communities pay in the droughts that destroy livelihoods and record cyclones. We see a small toll exacted every day as our shorelines are slowly eroded … small island communities are among the first to pay the price of climate change. But no one will escape forever ... We have a choice: we can pay in human misery or pay investing in a more equitable, resilient and sustainable future.” Paris “must be a watershed for the world” says Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The world must unite for a climate deal, he adds. Today we note with enthusiasm the political commitment of 180 countries, he says, in reference to the climate plans put forward already. “Let us understand in COP21 we are deciding what quality of life we want for the 21st century,” he says, signing off. Bob Perciasepe, president of the US-based NGO, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, says the simple presence of so many heads of state is a sign that Paris could yield a “breakthrough” climate deal. The presence of so many world leaders in Paris today is the clearest sign yet that we’re on the verge of an unprecedented breakthrough in the global climate effort. As the leaders themselves have made clear, many tough issues remain. But their overwhelming message is that a global challenge like climate change demands a global response, and they’re committed to delivering it. Over the past year we’ve seen greater will than ever, from developed and developing countries alike, and growing convergence on the broad contours of a deal. Negotiators are now on notice from their leaders that in two weeks’ time they must deliver a final accord. They call it “the family photo”: here’s a video from Reuters of leaders from most of the world’s countries gathering in Paris. Leaders will soon return from a lunch break with many more speeches expected this afternoon, including from UK prime minister David Cameron. He is expected to call for an agreement that gives “certainty to businesses and the public across the world that governments are serious about decarbonising”. But on Friday, 10 large businesses, which collectively employ more than 1 million people worldwide sent a letter to world leaders, asking for stable policies and funding to support renewable energy in the UK. They call for “a gradual phase-out of support” from the government for the clean energy sector rather than the current proposed cuts. They write: “regular changes to the policy environment undermine confidence in investment in infrastructure of all kinds and impact on the UK’s ability to continue competing in the rapidly growing global low-carbon sector.” The companies are: Tesco BT M&amp;S Vodafone Kingfisher Thames Water Unilever Nestlé IKEA Panasonic Greenpeace are promoting the letter here From one global negotiating text to $100bn of promised annual funds to developing countries – via 90 electric car charging points and 21,000 tons of CO2 emissions – I put together Paris in numbers: the figures that matter to COP21. Which figures have I missed? Let us know in the comments below. It’s not often that heads of state and government from more than 130 countries in the world come together in one place. We’ve been listening to their speeches all morning: US president Barack Obama, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese president Xi Jinping have already spoken. There are many more to come, including the UK’s David Cameron, who is expected to call for “a global deal for a global problem” Here’s our gallery of the leaders at COP21 in Paris today. As the leaders take a break from speeches, there’s some time to look at the reaction that’s been coming in. Author and activist Naomi Klein picks up Chinese president Xi Jinping: Meanwhile founder of 350.org Bill McKibben, writing today in the Guardian, reminds us that the talks are missing one of the most prominent climate change “leaders”, the Maldives’ Mohamed Nasheed. Six years ago, he was the first head of state to arrive at the talks in Copenhagen. Today he is in prison. WWF-UK have praised Prince Charles’ speech for speaking “from the heart”. Chief executive, David Nussbaum said: “HRH The Prince of Wales’ spoke from the heart and set exactly the right tone for the start of the Paris climate talks ... I hope the negotiators here in Paris will follow his plea and don’t lose sight of international necessities over national interests.” Prince Charles said: “The whole of nature cries out at our mistreatment of her. If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago. You, Ladies and Gentlemen, have the power to put her on life support, and you must surely start the emergency procedures without further procrastination!” You can read Prince Charles’ speech in full here. The current tally of countries that have submitted climate plans for emissions cuts beyond 2020 now stands at 183 of the 195 countries in the UN climate process. As Simon Evans at climate analysis site CarbonBrief notes, that’s unprecedented, far higher than those put forward up to 2020 after the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009. Putin signs off. “We hope that through concerted efforts we will be able to create a new global agreement that will replace the Kyoto protocol.” More on the Kyoto protocol here. Hollande congratulates the Russian president on being particularly brief and keeping to time, before handing the floor to Hungary. Vladmir Putin is up now. “Climate change has become one of the gravest challenges that humanity is facing,” he says, adding it is causing ever more tangible economic damage. Russia is taking the lead in terms of reducing its energy intensity, Putin claims. “We have gone beyond our commitments under the Kyoto protocol. From 1991 to 2012, Russia significantly reduced its emissions ... [equivalent to] 40bn tonnes of CO2e into the atmosphere [a little higher than current annual global higher emissions]... at the same time we have doubled GDP.” Russia will continue contributing to joint efforts aimed at preventing global warming, he says. We have to show we can deliver what we promised in Copenhagen - $100bn a year in climate aid to poorer countries by 2020 – Merkel says. She adds that the Paris deal should have a review mechanism for countries’ climate plans, and that countries must live up to those commitments. “This is a question of environmental necessity, but also of economic common sense ... Our very future as humankind hinges on this ... Billions of people are pinning their hopes on what we achieve here in Paris,” Merkel says. Paris climate deal must be comprehensive, ambitious, fair and binding, says Merkel. She cites INDCs (climate plans by governments) that have already been submitted ahead of this summit as a sign of hope. The bad news is that even so, those plans will not keep temperatures below 2C. The Paris deal must show how that gap can be closed, she says. German chancellor Angela Merkel says we are meeting here in turbulent times, mentioning the terrorist attacks of 13 November. “Through our presence here today we show we are stronger than the terrorists,” she says. Paris is about creating the basis, the foundation, a possible life for future generations, she says. “We are more than aware of the need to act today.” Norway and Brazil have agreed to continue a deal to protect the latter’s forests, until 2020. More details in statement here. Here’s the video of Obama’s climate speech: The Chinese government earnestly implements its policy commitments on climate change, Xi says. Next year, China will launch cooperation projects for 10 low carbon industrial parks and more than 100 mitigation climate projects in other countries, he announces. “Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind. All eyes are now on Paris,” he says as he finishes up, calling for new relationships that bring about “win-win” outcomes. Our news story on Obama’s speech is up. Here’s an excerpt: Barack Obama has told crucial UN climate talks in Paris that the negotiations represent an act of defiance after the barbaric attacks in the city two weeks ago in which 130 people were killed. Offering his condolences to the people of “this beautiful city” the US president said: “We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on ... What greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshalling our best efforts to save it.” China has been actively involved in tackling climate change, Xi says, talking of its record on renewable energy. Going forward, ecological endeavours will feature prominently in China’ 13th five year plan, he says. Xi says it is imperative to respect differences between countries’ level of development and ability to cut emissions. Addressing climate change should not impair countries’ ability to develop, he says. The Paris conference is not the finishing line, but a new starting point, he says. The Paris conference should all countries, in particular developed countries, to assume more responsibilities. China’s president, Xi Jinping, is speaking. The Paris agreement should chart a course for green development, he says. The agreement should put effective control on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The agreement should galvanise global efforts [to cut emissions]. Besides governments, it should mobilise NGOs, and all players in society to participate in international cooperation on climate change. “Let there be no doubt. The next generation is watching what we do,” Obama says. He tells the story of a young Indonesia woman he met recently in Malaysia, who asked him if was optimistic for Paris summit. “I want our actions to show her we are listening ... I want to show her passionate idealistic young generation that we care about their future.” He cites Martin Luther King’s “such a thing as being too late” quote. “If we act here, if we act now, if we place our short term interests over air our young people will breathe ... we won’t be too late for them.” No quick victories in tackling climate change, Obama says, just suffering averted. Our generation may not live to see see full impacts of what Paris achieves, he says. “Let’s get to work,” he says, signing off. Obama is up. We have come to Paris to show our resolve. We offer our condolences for the barbaric attacks on this beautiful city. We stand united in solidarity. ... We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on. An act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children. What greater rejection for those who would tear down our world then marshalling our best efforts to save it. The growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more than any other [issue]. This could be the turning point ... Our understanding of the ways human beings disrupt the climate advances by the day. 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have occurred since the year 2000. 2015 is on pace to be the warmest year of all. No nation ... is immune to what this means. This summer I saw the effects of climate change first hand in Alaska, where the sea is already swallowing villages and eroding shorelines ... where glaciers are melting a a pace unprecedented in modern times. It was a preview of one possible future: our children’s fate ... That future is not one of strong economies, nor of one where fragile states can find their footing. That future is one we have the power to change. Right here. Right now. But only if we rise to this moment. As one of America’s governors has said, we are one of the first generations to feel the impact of climate change and one of the last to do something about it. I have come here personally as leader of world’s biggest economy and second biggest emitter, he says, to say the that America not only acknowledges its role in climate change but embraces doing something about it. “We have broken the old arguments for inaction [on climate change],” he says. “One of the enemies we will be fighting at this conference is cynicism. The notion we cannot do anything about climate change.” He cites agreement recently on HFC phase-out, and climate plans put ahead by countries as progress on climate action. He says a deal should have ambition, regularly updated targets, taken into account differences each nation is facing, a strong system of transparency to given countries’ confidence that others are meeting their commitments. Let’s reaffirm our commitment to helping countries skip the dirty phase of development, he says. He cites a green energy project the US is joining – more on that in our news story here. “We know the truth, that many nations have contributed little to climate change but will be the first to feel its most destructive effects. For some, island nations, climate change is a threat to their very existence.” He says the US will pledge new contributions to a least developed countries fund on Tuesday. “Let’s show businesses and investors that the global economy is on a firm path to a low carbon future,” he says. Jean-François Julliard, executive director of Greenpeace France, says of the French president’s address this morning: Hollande has helpfully laid out what a meaningful deal would look like. Now it will be for him and the leaders of other key countries to deliver. Here’s that family photograph of heads of state: Morocco’s king has lost his voice so his son is delivering the country’s address instead. The Paris conference will be instrumental in shaping the future which we are duty-bound to bequeath to our children, he says. He says the natural world’s heritage is threatened because the international community has not yet acted sufficiently on climate change. There is not a single country that will be spared the consequences of climate change, he says, echoing what climate scientists at the IPCC said in their last big report. Paraguay has lots of forests and it’s planting more trees, Cartes says, as he lays out what his country is doing on climate change. He says the country is not a big contributor to climate change (it’s not, it’s about 0.1% of global emissions, compared to around 1.4% for the UK) but it does suffer from its impacts. “Let’s change history ... let’s wake up,” he says as he signs off. Next up, Morocco, which will host the next UN climate summit. Then the US. Climate bingo! Paraguay’s president, Horacio Manuel Cartes, becomes first leader of the day to quote Pope Francis’s encyclical on climate change earlier this year. The leaders’ speeches are being streamed on the UN site now. French president Francois Hollande has told delegates the future of the world depends on the Paris climate deal Hollande said France would not choose between fighting terrorism and global warming Ban Ki-moon told leaders that the Paris climate summit could not afford indecision or half measures The UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, says “never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few” Prince Charles told delegates that climate change is the world’s great threat and leaders must act now My colleague John Vidal has posted his five reason to be hopeful of a good deal in Paris - and five reasons to be fearful. Top of his reasons to cheerful, as has been made clear in opening remarks this morning, is “the world really wants a strong deal”. Leaders speeches are about to begin – Obama is on third and Xi is fifth. Organisers of Sunday’s marches around the world say that despite the Paris centrepiece one being forbidden by authorities, 720,000 people marched in around 2,300 events in 175 countries. In remarks earlier this morning, Ban Ki-moon urged world leaders to listen to the voices of the people who marched. Here’s the video of Prince Charles’ address: And here’s the full transcript of his speech. The world leaders are now heading off for their ‘family photograph’. Laurent Fabius talks of a large photograph in the conference hall, which on on the left has a tree that has lost all its leaves, they’ve been replaced by plastic bags, “it’s a kind of skeletion, in an environment that has become inhumane.” To the right, he says, is the portrait of a young child waking up. And in the middle is a butterfly, a symbol of hope. “And that is where we are. Eiether we fail in Paris and spread desolation everywhere, or we succeed and spread a bright future ...,” he says. Climate change is more than an environmental issue, we need to address it to protect biodiversity, address poverty and stop wars, he says. It is down to France to fight against terorrisim and combat climate change. Future generations will judge us on our actions, he adds. “The word historic is often overused, but here that is not the case. Together let’s make sure that we make the conference in Paris the historic success that the world is waiting for,” he says at the end of his speech. Nearly every country in the world has now lodged an INDC (intended nationally determined contributions) with the UN, showing how they would cut emissions. In the past few days Angola, Nigeria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran, South Sudan, Palau, Tuvalu, Malaysia, Jamaica, and Niue have all outlined their plans and they could not be more different. Nigeria, with a population of 175m and an economy based on oil, plans to bar cars from cities and ramp up solar and wind power. But it says it only plans to “work towards ending gas flaring by 2030”. Meanwhile, Niue, a tiny Pacific island with a population of about 2,000 people, plans to reduce its electricity demand by 10% and massively increase its renewable energy from 2% now to 38% by 2020. South Sudan, the world’s youngest state which is also dependent on oil, plans to develop hydro power and to plant 20m trees in the next 10 years. This is a pivotal moment for the future of your countries, your people, and our common home, Ban says to world leaders. “The fate of the Paris agreemtn rests with you,” Ban tells heads of state. “The future of your people, the future of the people of the world, is in your hands. We cannot afford indecision, half measures or merely gradual approaches, our goal must be a transformation.” He’s now also mentioning Sunday’s rallies of more than half a million people around the world, and last year’s People’s Climate March, saying those people are sending their voices to world leaders. He asks leaders to listen to those voices. Ban is laying out his criteria for a successful deal. The agreement must be lasting, and must not need continually renegotiating, he says. It must also balance responsibilities of developed and developing countries. Must have solidarity with the world’s poor, he says. It must also be credible, current ambition must be the floor not the ceiling of future efforts, he says, adding five year cycles for a review mechanism will be “crucial”. Developed countries must also keep their promise of delivering $100bn of climate aid a year to poorer countries by 2020. A new agreement must include a framework for monitoring those financial flows, he says. You are here today to write the script for a new future, says Ban Ki-moon. “We have never faced such a test. A political momentum like this may not come again. But neither have we encountered such a great opportunity.” He tells leaders to urge negotiators to choose a path of compromise and consensus at the talks. Bold climate action is in the interests of every single country represented at this conference, he says, saying the time for brinkmanship is over. “Paris must mark a decisive turning point,” he says. Hollande says: To resolve the climate crisis, to be frank, good wishes, declarations of intent will not be enough. We are on the brink of a breaking point. Paris must be the start of far-reaching change. We can no longer consider nature as a pool of inexhaustible resources ... “Everything depends on us,” he tells the nearly 150 heads of state at the meeting, warning them: “the hope of all humanity rests on your shoulders.” He says he understands for world leaders how difficult it is to balance short-term and long-term imperatives. “Our greaterst challenge is to go from a globalisation based on competition to a model based on cooperative, where it will be more profitable to protect rather than destroy,” he says. “Here in Paris we will decide on the very future of the planet,” he says. Hollande says he wanted heads of state to attend at the start of the summit to give it ambition consummate with the challenge of climate change, he said. On what conditions could we consider this a great agreement, he asks, before listing three conditions of what would be a “successful” deal in Paris in two weeks’ time: The first is that we need to sketch out a credible path allowing us to limit global warming to below 2C, or 1.5C if possible. For us to be sure of being on the right path, we need to provide for regular assessment ... and therefore setup a revision mechanism that corresponds with our commitments every five years. The second is that we respond to the climate challenge with solidarity. No state can abstain from its commitments ... My thoughts go to those islands which, very simply, could very soon disappear ... From this we can conclude the agreement must be universal, differential and binding. Developed countries for years emitted the most greenhouse gases. Emerging countries must accelerate their energy transition [to clean energy]. [talks about climate finance] The third element is that all parts of society get moving [goes on to to say this means local governments as well as national governments] Hope has emerged during preparations for COP21, Hollande says, flagging up the sustainable development goals agreed in September. He also lists the climate action plans put forward by more than 180 countries ahead of the summit (more on that here), and rapid progress being made on clean and renewable energy. France has thrown its full weight behind the success of the summit, and mobilised the whole of government to make the Paris climate summit, he says. It’s in the name of climate justice that I’m speaking before you today, Hollande says, talking of the poorest countries with the least responsibility for causing global warming being the most vulnerable to its impacts. This is a historic day that we are experiencing, Hollande tells delegates: Never has a conference welcomed so many dignatories from so many countries. But never have the stakes of an international meeting, and I say never, been so higher. What is at stake is the future of the planet, of life. And yet two weeks ago here in Paris it was death that a group of fanatics brought to the streets. Here I want to express to you the gratitude of the French people for all the shows of support, of friendship we have received since 13 November. Tragic events represent an afflciation but also an oblgiation. They force us to focus on what is important. Your presence has generated immense hope which we do not have the right to disappoint. I’m not choosing between the fight against terrorism and the fight against global warming. These are two major challenges we must overcome. We must leave our children more than a world free of terror, we owe them a planet protected from disasters, a viable livable planet. The year we have just lived through has been a record-breaking year, temperatures, CO2 levels, a record number of climate events ... The UN secretary general commends Francois Hollande on going ahead with the climate summit the despite terror attacks of 13 November, and extends his condolences to the victims of the attacks. No cause or grievance can justify the violence, he says, mentioning violence elsewhere, such as in Beirut. He has just asked delegates to stand for a minute’s silence in honour of victims. Speeches by heads of state start at 10pm GMT. Prince Charles is addressing the summit. He echoes Figueres, saying “rarely have so many people placed their trust in the hands of so few.” “I can only urge you to think of your grandchildren, as I think of mine, and of those billions of people without voice, those for whom hope is the rarest of sensations,” he tells delegates, urging them to consider the needs of the youngest generation. “Humanity faces many threats but none is greater than climate change,” he says, adding that it threatens our ability to feed ourselves, leaves us at risk of extreme weather, mass migration and increasing conflict. “In damaging our climate, we become the architects of our destruction ... While our planet can survive the scorching of the Earth and the rising of the waters, mankind cannot,” he says. “There is no doubt that the global climate change agreement that we seek must be part of what Paris has become. In the face of adversity, in the face of threats of many kinds, Paris must be where the world unites as one. Paris must be where we show that we are capable in solidarity with one another... determined to collectively commit ourselves for the common good to global safety and for enduring wellbeing for all,” says Christian Figueres, executive director of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), at the summit’s opening ceremony. She tells delegates: “The eyes of millions of people are on you, not just figuratively but literally” and “never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few.” Good morning from London. Today 195 countries and nearly 150 heads of state meet in Paris for two weeks of talks to reach a new climate change agreement to avoid dangerous global warming. Here’s a brief at-a-glance guide to what the talks are all about. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, has just been formally elected president of the COP21 Paris talks by the president of last year’s summit in Lima and Peru’s environment minister, Manuel Pulgar Vidal. “The Paris conference is a special one, because at the end of the mandate established in Durban in 2011, it is for us to adopt at the COP21 “a new protocol, an other legal instrument or a concerted solution with legal force applicable to all the parties of the UNFCCC. In order to achieve this dear friends, we have just 11 short days before us and in fact fewer, given the time necessary for some final legal verifications and translations into six languages, and we are obliged to succeed,” said Fabius on taking to the podium at the talks. He added that the role of the French government as hosts of the summit would be to listen, to be transparent (“no hidden agenda, no secret plan, no text in our pockets,” he said, in an apparent reference to the so-called secret text at Copenhagen talks in 2009) and ambitious. “The eyes of the world are upon and there are great hopes, it is therefore for us to meet our responsibilities head on so that on 11 December we can say the world the four words the world is waiting to hear: our mission is accomplished,” said Fabius. The opening of the summit comes after more than half a million people marched around the world on Sunday demanding a strong deal in Paris. Later this morning we’re expecting speeches by the heads of state to begin, as well as a speech by Prince Charles. Fiona Harvey, Lenore Taylor and John Vidal are on the ground reporting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/mar/08/ethical-investments-zoe-williams-diy-money-manifesto","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-08T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ethical investments: Zoe Williams' DIY money manifesto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/08/ethical-investments-zoe-williams-diy-money-manifesto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/mar/08/ethical-investments-zoe-williams-diy-money-manifesto","fields":{"headline":"Ethical investments: Zoe Williams' DIY money manifesto","bodyText":"This week, the chief executive of Barclays, Antony Jenkins, explained the rationale behind a £200m increase in bonuses at the bank, despite the fact that profits had fallen. There had been resignations at the bank the year before, when bonuses had been cut. He feared a \"death spiral\". Nobody wants a death spiral. Meanwhile, Lloyds and RBS handed out £35m in bonuses to top management on Friday. It's time we admitted that nothing is ever going to change; bankers are always going to be rewarded way too much, for doing the wrong thing; they will continue to take risks that bring misery to everybody but themselves; they will exercise no restraint of their own, and it's extremely unlikely that EU bonus-capping measures will be effective. Far from the crash forcing reform and some kind of moral reflection on the financial sector, the opposite has happened; they know, now, that they're untouchable. Any error they make will be absorbed by the state. All they have to say is \"death spiral\" and we'll all pipe down, anything to avoid another bail out. It's pointless to kvetch about their morals – they're simply reasonable people acting on the information before them. We can question how governments arrived at this norm or the idea that no cost is too great to save these institutions. But we also have to question our own norms – after all, Barclays wouldn't exist if we didn't put our money into it. Banking won't change until we change. Six months ago, I took all my \"investable wealth\" out of normal financial circulation; I put a grand into the environment village Findhorn (these are shares), although if I'm honest, I didn't find out exactly what they did or what they wanted the money for, I'm just assuming they were environmental because someone on the website had a beard. I put £2,000 into Golden Lane Housing (this is a bond), a housing association for people with a learning disability. I put £5,000 into a solar energy project called Hoo Solar (this is a debenture), and because of some combination of capital returns and dividends, I got £165, which I put into SunShare Community in Nottingham. I put two grand in something for which I've lost the paperwork, but it'll turn up. I invested £10,000 directly into setting up a local cafe, which is, I guess, also in the form of a debenture, but that's a moot point, given that neither the cafe's owner nor I know what debenture means. There is no element of that sentence that I don't find embarrassing, running on a spectrum from \"slightly awkward\" to \"profound shame\". I'm embarrassed to even talk about money, of course; I'm embarrassed to have \"investable income\"; I'm embarrassed that I've got money and I haven't given it away; I'm embarrassed that I haven't got more money, having been working for 19 years; I'm embarrassed that I haven't done anything with my pension; I'm embarrassed to say what the pension pot is (that it's so big and that it isn't bigger); OK, now I'm embarrassed of that embarrassment, it's £158k; I'm embarrassed at my ignorance of most financial instruments, my lack of curiosity, my mathematical ceiling and I'm embarrassed to launch a conversation that is so boring. That's just the shame off the top of my head, before I've even interrogated what money means to me in relation to love. (Our first introduction to money is, after all, that our parents give it to us; but what are their terms? Do they do it as a reward when you've pleased them, or as payment for a chore, or in a regimented weekly fashion, or exuberantly, when they're in a good mood?) Everybody who doesn't take money as the highest value of all human activity feels this embarrassment around it. Many people will say, if you're so ethical, why don't you just give it away? This is a conundrum that Jamie Hartzell faced when he was 20, in the 1980s – his father died and he inherited £100,000 that he wasn't expecting, some of which he gave away through the Network for Social Change. He now runs Ethex, an ethical stockmarket (through which I bought some of those bonds). He describes that leftie dilemma: \"I started thinking, well, if you're giving money away, you've lost control of the money, you don't know what's happening to it. If you're investing the money, it can go further, and you've still got it.\" This is how the left got its reputation for being unable to handle money – the presentation of the \"good\" person as infantile, giving money away not in a messianic style, at random, to passing lepers, but to some authority figure, like a charity, who would disperse it sensibly in ways that the good person wouldn't understand. The problem is, this leaves you at the outermost fringes of the actual world. \"We're all capitalists now,\" says Catherine Howarth, from Share Action, a pressure group trying to change the way pensions funds are invested. They're in Crucifix Lane, off Druid Street, in London Bridge, which adds to my abiding feeling that I'm entering badlands, a world in which we all have to be capitalists even if we'd rather be a liberal egalitarian. But wait: \"We've got this deadly dull thing called pensions automatic enrolment, by which we all have a stake in massive companies … We've got pension savers who are paid less than the living wage by the very companies they've invested their pension in. If the way these companies invest today is actually rapidly taking us towards uncontrolled climate change, then the very companies that are supposed to be our insurance for the future are undermining our future quality of life.\" This isn't a scenario in which we have to join them having failed to beat them. This is one in which we've already, de facto, joined the game; we've been in the game for years. We just have to stop losing. Bruce Davis, who set up Abundance, which crowdsources energy funding (this is where I bought my debenture), having previously co-founded Zopa, the peer-to-peer lender, talks about the \"social life of money\" – not the social purpose to which you put your money, though he talks about that too. Rather, the fact that money holds a different value to us, depending on its source. Earned money is different from inherited money; money you win, or that has any \"luck\" element feels unreliable, and that changes what you'll do with it. Money you get in benefits from the government is slippery and difficult to make coherent decisions about. Money you get in pension from the government, conversely, is seen as simply coming back to you from the pot you put it into, even though there is no pot, and that money was spent years ago, on some 1970s textbooks. At some point, those of us who would deny that money motivated us, or who would deny that we cared about it, have to accept that it has emotional weight. It is as much a part of my personality as it is a part of Warren Buffet's. Hartzell says: \"People tend to use money amorally. They don't think about the implications of what their money does. Or they just don't think about money full stop.\" This leads to bizarre situations – you might spend your life worrying about the environment, but have your pension invested in Shell. Collectively, we're quite good at noticing – and pointing out – the disconnect when a charity is a major shareholder in Wonga; but a personal disconnect, in which our money's activity bears no relation to our values, is something we live with. It's partly a sense of how pointlessly small your stake in the system is. It's partly a sense of impotence and fear in the face of complexity, and it's partly the active design of the system, as Hartzell explains. \"It is a law. You have to sign a declaration that says you haven't put more than 10% of your investable wealth into unlisted securities.\" Huh? I did not know that. Also, I don't know what an unlisted security is. \"What they want you to do is put your money in the hands of someone who's going to make responsible investments on your behalf, which fuels the disempowerment process. You create a regulatory system like [the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)], and then you have professionals who adopt the system, and then the regulators work with the professionals, and it becomes a closed club.\" The absurdities of this system are densely packed. The stock market has bounced back to become the only mark of respectability the government regulator will recognise. Even though its abiding principle is to sacrifice long-term benefit for short-term profit, the stock market is still wearing its metaphorical pin-striped suit. It should be in a balaclava. Meanwhile, the very characteristics of investments that make them \"social\" – that they won't go on the stock market because they want to maintain their structure, whether that's as mutual or having an asset-lock or other terms I'm not all over but sound proper – consign them to a life in the FCA's high-risk hinterland. But if money means different things in different hands, ethics can mean different things in different mouths. \"If you give your money away\", Hartzell continues, \"you're expecting a strong social or environmental return, and you're going to get a minus 100% financial return. If you invest your money, you're looking at 5% or 10%. But there's a lot of space between 5% and minus 100%. The traditional male, Wasp view, the Bill Gates view, is: 'I make money and then give it away and go down as a great philanthropist.' If everyone blended their giving and investing together, so that you aimed for a modest return, it might be more useful.\" But even if you accept that investing can be an ethical choice, what counts as ethical? I'd count investment in renewables, regardless of what the profit margin is, or how it's distributed, purely because it means returning to capitalism in a useful, literal sense: you take capital that you have and you lend it to someone building something you agree with. I'd also count peer-to-peer lending, even though there is no requirement for people to spend the money you lend ethically. They're unlikely to be using it for arms or child labour; usually they are just getting their bathrooms done. However, Hartzell disputes that there's anything inherently ethical about this stuff. \"Most crowdfunding businesses are private companies. They'll be making losses at the start, but their endgame is to be bought out by a bigger company, like Lloyds or something, and then it will change a bit. Everyone gets terribly excited about it, but really it's just a minor adjustment.\" Perhaps what I'm talking about isn't ethics so much as change – breaking the hegemony of the financial system, disrupting a system that seems purpose-built for destruction of one kind or another. Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding, it increasingly seems, are neither new ideas nor inherently ethical ones. \"It's a technology mechanism coming to the fore rather than a new way of doing things,\" Hartzell points out. \"That's what the original building societies were, they were mutuals, people came together to build houses. Credit unions have been going since 1800s.\" These aren't new ideas. They are, merely, good ideas. But most people's investments are entirely in their pension, which means they can't work outside the system; 95% of people are unavoidably in the pension fund chosen by their employer. As Catherine Howarth describes, \"Shell is the biggest single holding in most pension funds. Everybody holds a massive amount. Shell has had really crummy financial returns for five years. The financial case for drilling in the Arctic is ropey at best. Our argument is, let's have a massive campaign to make sure that our pensions funds say, 'Don't go there.' We're a small outfit, we're not going to change the world overnight, but we're doing some things which are quite well targeted.\" An hour after I spoke to Howarth, Shell announced a moratorium on drilling in the Arctic. It's just for 2014, but still … that's something. That's something beyond quarterly results and the bottom line, and the bizarre, myopic assumptions that fall under the heading \"business\". I've heard so many arguments against pension activism and ethical investing – that it's just a consumer choice, that it's politically neutering, that it's exclusive, that it's just another way of shopping at a farmer's market. And I accept it all, but still return to the fact – banks will not change; the world has to change around them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/feb/12/printed-solar-glass-panels-oxford-photovoltaics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-12T17:05:13Z","webTitle":"Colourful 'solar glass' means entire buildings can generate clean power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/12/printed-solar-glass-panels-oxford-photovoltaics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/12/printed-solar-glass-panels-oxford-photovoltaics","fields":{"headline":"Colourful 'solar glass' means entire buildings can generate clean power","bodyText":"A solar power company capable of \"printing\" colourful glass that can generate electricity from the sun's energy announced a £2m funding boost on Tuesday. Oxford Photovoltaics, a spin-off from the University of Oxford, said the investment from clean-tech investors MTI Partners will help its solar glass, which can be dyed almost any colour, take a step closer to the commercial market. \"What we say here is rather than attach [solar] photovoltaics to the building, why not make the building the photovoltaics?\" Kevin Arthur, the company's founder and CEO, told the Guardian. \"If you decide to build a building out of glass, then you've already decided to pay for the glass. If you add this, you're adding a very small extra cost. [The solar cell treatment] costs no more than 10% of the cost of the facade.\" These generally cost between £600 and £1,000 per square metre, meaning the new cell treatment wouild cost just £60-£100 extra per square metre. The technology works by adding a layer of transparent solid-state solar cells at most three microns thick to conventional glass, in order to turn around 12% of the solar energy received into low-carbon electricity. The power can then be exported to the national grid or used for the running of a building. \"Within reason we can print any colour, there's a wide range of dyes, blues and greens and reds and so on. But different colours have different efficiencies: black is very high, green is pretty good and red is good, but blue is less good,\" said Arthur. The £2m investment will pay for equipment and recruiting staff for the company's new base on the Begbroke Science Park near Oxford. The company is looking to build a much larger manufacturing facility next year, with full size panels available for sampling and trials at the end of 2014. A4-sized samples will be ready by the end of 2013. While the company is mostly targeting customers planning new buildings, it also \"very interested\" in retrofits on the facades of existing buildings. Separately, a team at the University of Sheffield and University of Cambridge this week said they had succeeded in developing a process to 'spray paint' solar cells on to surfaces and, potentially in the future, roofs and buildings. The teams believe the process could significantly cut the cost of solar in the future, but currently only works on \"very smooth\" surfaces and is less efficient than conventional solar panels. Professor David Lidzey from the University of Sheffield said: \"Spray coating is currently used to apply paint to cars and in graphic printing. We have shown that it can also be used to make solar cells using specially designed plastic semiconductors. Maybe in the future surfaces on buildings and even car roofs will routinely generate electricity with these materials.\" Solar power worldwide reached 100GW installed capacity last year for the first time, up from 71GW in 2011 and just 40GW in 2010, according to recent trade body figures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/mar/25/frozen-spring-arctic-sea-ice-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-25T17:03:32Z","webTitle":"Scientists link frozen spring to dramatic Arctic sea ice loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/25/frozen-spring-arctic-sea-ice-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/mar/25/frozen-spring-arctic-sea-ice-loss","fields":{"headline":"Scientists link frozen spring to dramatic Arctic sea ice loss","bodyText":"Climate scientists have linked the massive snowstorms and bitter spring weather now being experienced across Britain and large parts of Europe and North America to the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice. Both the extent and the volume of the sea ice that forms and melts each year in the Arctic Ocean fell to an historic low last autumn, and satellite records published on Monday by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, show the ice extent is close to the minimum recorded for this time of year. \"The sea ice is going rapidly. It's 80% less than it was just 30 years ago. There has been a dramatic loss. This is a symptom of global warming and it contributes to enhanced warming of the Arctic,\" said Jennifer Francis, research professor with the Rutgers Institute of Coastal and Marine Science. According to Francis and a growing body of other researchers, the Arctic ice loss adds heat to the ocean and atmosphere which shifts the position of the jet stream – the high-altitude river of air that steers storm systems and governs most weather in northern hemisphere. \"This is what is affecting the jet stream and leading to the extreme weather we are seeing in mid-latitudes,\" she said. \"It allows the cold air from the Arctic to plunge much further south. The pattern can be slow to change because the [southern] wave of the jet stream is getting bigger. It's now at a near record position, so whatever weather you have now is going to stick around,\" she said. Francis linked the Arctic temperature rises to extreme weather in mid latitudes last year and warned in September that 2012's record sea ice melt could lead to a cold winter in the UK and northern Europe. She was backed by Vladimir Petoukhov, professor of Earth system analysis at Potsdam Institute in Germany, whose research suggests the loss of ice this year could be changing the direction of the jet stream. \"The ice was at a record low last year and is now exceptionally low in some parts of the Arctic like the Labrador and Greenland seas. This could be one reason why anticyclones are developing,\" he said. The heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures which have marked March 2013 across the northern hemisphere are in stark contrast to March 2012 when many countries experienced their warmest ever springs. The hypothesis that wind patterns are being changed because melting Arctic sea ice has exposed huge swaths of normally frozen ocean to the atmosphere would explain both the extremes of heat and cold, say the scientists. A recent paper by the US government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also found that enhanced warming of the Arctic influenced weather across the northern hemisphere. \"With more solar energy going into the Arctic Ocean because of lost ice, there is reason to expect more extreme weather events, such as heavy snowfall, heat waves, and flooding in North America and Europe,\" said the researchers. The Met Office's chief scientist has previously said the melting Arctic ice is in part responsible for the UK's recent colder winters. The possible links between Arctic sea ice loss and extreme weather were made as the UK's government's outgoing chief scientific adviser Sir John Beddington warned that the world could expect more extremes of weather. \"The [current] variation we are seeing in temperature or rainfall is double the rate of the average. That suggests that we are going to have more droughts, we are going to have more floods, we are going to have more sea surges and we are going to have more storms.\" He said that said there was a \"need for urgency\" in tackling climate change. \"These are the sort of changes that are going to affect us in quite a short timescale,\" he warned. Last year saw record heat, rainfall, drought and floods in the northern hemisphere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/scale-up-urban-vegetable-farming","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-20T14:43:09Z","webTitle":"Finance for farming: scaling up urban vegetable farmin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/scale-up-urban-vegetable-farming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/scale-up-urban-vegetable-farming","fields":{"headline":"Finance for farming: scaling up urban vegetable farming","bodyText":"Most of the organic baby greens sold in Washington DC supermarkets are not \"green\" at all. They're grown in the Salinas Valley in California, which has been called the most hydrologically altered landmass on the planet. Then they are shipped in refrigerated trucks roughly 2,800 miles across America. Paul Lightfoot thinks there's a better way to get fresh lettuce, tomatoes and herbs into the hands of supermarket shoppers. Lightfoot is chief executive of a startup called BrightFarms, which builds and operates urban, hydroponic greenhouse farms. The company operates a greenhouse farm in Philadelphia, it's building another on a massive rooftop in Brooklyn, and it is developing farms in St Louis, Kansas City, St Paul and Oklahoma City. But Lightfoot, 43, is not a farmer. He's a business guy who used to run a software company that helped retailers manage their supply chains, so he understands the inefficiencies of moving stuff around. Shrinking the distance between farm and fork, he says, is good for the environment, good for supermarkets and their shoppers and good for the bottom line at BrightFarms. Its products, which include spring mix, Asian greens, baby arugula, baby kale, basil, and several varieties of tomatoes, will cost no more and in some cases will sell for less than competing brands. \"We're just a better supply-chain model,\" Lightfoot says. Last week, Lightfoot travelled to Washington, where he joined with the city's mayor, Vincent Gray, to unveil plans for the first large-scale hydroponic farm in the nation's capital. The 100,000sq ft greenhouse will be built in Anacostia, a depressed neighbourhood that few tourists ever see, on city-owned vacant land that has been under-utilised and plagued by illegal dumping. During a news conference at the site, Lightfoot said the greenhouse is expected to produce about 1m pounds of tomatoes, lettuce and herbs annually, enough to feed about 5,000 people. It will provide about 25 permanent \"green collar\" jobs in a neighbourhood that needs them. And the produce from the greenhouse will be fresher, more flavoursome and nutritious than lettuce and tomatoes trucked in from California, Arizona or Mexico. \"How about that,\" says Gray, \"a farm in the district!\" Urban farms, of course, are nothing new. City dwellers have always grown vegetables in backyard plots or community gardens. Lately, the notion of urban agriculture has become fashionable. Nonprofits such as Will Allen's Growing Power and Urban Farming have garnered support from major foundations, including Ford and Kellogg, and underwriting from brands such as Triscuit and Coca-Cola. But conventional urban farms produce less than greenhouses and, while these NGOs have trained and inspired city farmers everywhere, they lack the capital to rapidly scale. By contrast, BrightFarms has devised a scalable business model that enables the company to raise capital on a project-by-project basis for its greenhouses, which cost about $4m each to build. Essentially, BrightFarms first secures a supermarket partner and enters into a long-term contract, which it calls a produce purchase agreement (PPA), which commits the retailer to buy produce from the greenhouse. Once a stream of future revenues is secured, BrightFarms then raises equity or debt to finance the greenhouse. The company has signed PPAs with supermarket chains A&amp;P and SuperValu, and it is talking with others. If the model sounds familiar, it should. It's borrowed directly from the electricity industry, which finances power plants by borrowing against long-term contracts called power purchase agreements. An early investor in BrightFarms and key mentor to Lightfoot was Brian Robertson, who co-founded solar energy company SunEdison and brought PPAs to the solar business. BrightFarms owns the greenhouses and hires local managers to operate them. It typically gets land for free or acquires it at a low cost. Lightfoot says: \"If you're willing to locate in places that need jobs and economic development, there's an enormous amount of space in every city in the country.\" So far, BrightFarms has raised about $7m in debt and equity for its own operations and another $5m in project finance. It has signed PPAs worth a total of $70m in future revenues. The upshot is that supermarkets can offer their shoppers locally-grown food, without having to deal with dozens of small farmers or invest their own money in greenhouses. Hydroponic farming – growing vegetables in water with nutrient solutions – uses less water and fewer pesticides than soil farming. BrightFarms is collecting data on yields, water use and energy consumption of its produce. BrightFarms is still very small, of course. US farmers will grow about 4bn tons of lettuce this year, and the startup will grow a few million. But, if energy costs rise and water grows more scarce, BrightFarms and others could point the way to a food system that's more sensible and sustainable than the one we have now.

By giving both consumers and companies just a few weeks' notice that they intended to halve solar \"feed-in tariffs\" (FiTs) from 43.3p to 21p paid per kWh of energy generated, they have created uncertainty among investors and undermined public confidence in energy policy, said the MPs. \"There is no question that solar subsidies needed to be urgently reduced, but the government has handled this clumsily. Ministers should have spotted the solar gold rush much earlier. That way subsidy levels could have been reduced in a more orderly way without delivering such a shock to the industry,\" said Tim Yeo, chair of the energy and climate change committee. In addition, plans to require homes to meet a C-rated energy efficiency standard before they can receive subsidies will limit access to wealthier households and could have a \"fatal impact\" on the industry, the MPs warn. Eighty six per cent of homes would need to be better insulated before they could qualify for the scheme under the government's proposals – increasing up-front costs for homeowners by between £5,600 and £14,000, even before the panels are purchased, they said. Joan Walley, chair of the environmental audit committee said: \"It doesn't make economic sense to let the sun go down on the solar industry in the UK. As well as helping to cut carbon emissions, every panel that is installed brings in VAT for the government and every company that benefits from the support is keeping people in work. The government is right to encourage people to focus on saving energy before fitting solar panels, but these proposals will stop nine out of 10 installations from going ahead, which will have a devastating effect on hundreds of solar companies and small building firms installing these panels across the country.\" Rising energy bills and the falling cost of solar panels made the original subsidy rates so attractive that tens of thousands of households, companies and community groups have rushed to install photo-voltaic (PV) systems since the scheme was introduced last year. The government had evidence that solar panel prices were falling significantly as early as March 2011, but ministers did not act to stem rocketing levels of small scale solar installations until the end of October. According to the MPs, the consultation then announced by the government was based on an inadequate impact assessment and unfairly set a 12 December deadline for changes to come into effect before the close of the consultation on 23 December. The scale and pace of the changes proposed was a shock for the solar industry and the suddenness of their introduction has damaged investor confidence across the whole energy sector, the MPs said. The government has proposed an even lower tariff (80% of the new rate) for generators who have more than one solar system registered for FiTs, in recognition of the economics of scale such aggregated schemes can achieve. This, said the MPs, will have an adverse impact on community solar projects. \"This could have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged and poorer communities for whom such schemes are a good way of accessing the benefits of renewable energy and reducing electricity costs. The social housing sector and community owned schemes are going to be particularly hard hit by the reduced tariffs being brought in by the government retrospectively,\" said the MPs. Separately, on Wednesday, government plans to cut incentive payments for householders who install solar panels were ruled \"legally flawed\" by a high court judge. The ruling opens the door for a judicial review that could force the government to delay its plans, potentially allowing thousands more people to claim the higher subsidy. The judgment on Wednesday comes after a challenge by Friends of the Earth and two solar companies who argued that the government's decision to cut the feed-in tariff – from 43.3p to 21p per kWh of energy generated – with only a few weeks' notice was premature and unlawful, and had led to unfinished or planned projects being abandoned. Many thousands of individuals, farmers, councils and community groups had applied to install solar PV to take advantage of the generous subsidy which had been set deliberately high to encourage people to invest, when the scheme was launched in April 2010. But the government announced in October that it would cut the subsidy with effect from 12 December. This was 11 days before the consultation ended. The judgment, made by Mr Justice Mitting after a two-day court hearing, was hailed as a major victory by green campaigners and the solar industry, after firms warned that the scale and pace of the proposed cuts would have a crippling effect on the sector resulting in thousands of job losses. Mitting said the minister was proposing to make an unlawful decision. Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: \"These botched and illegal plans have cast a huge shadow over the solar industry, jeopardising thousands of jobs. We hope this ruling will prevent ministers rushing through damaging changes to clean energy subsidies – giving solar firms a much-needed confidence boost. Lawyers for the Department of Energy and Climate Change immediately moved to apply for permission to appeal the judge's ruling. The MPs' report and court ruling follows the decision by BP to close its solar division, blaming the \"commoditisation\" of the sector. It emerged this week that Mike Petrucci, chief executive of BP Solar, wrote to his remaining 100 staff last week to say that \"the continuing global economic challenges have significantly impacted the solar industry, making it difficult to sustain long-term returns for the company.\" • This article's headline and structure were amended on 22 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/dec/31/10-hopeful-things-2013-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-31T16:50:28Z","webTitle":"10 hopeful things from 2013 that will get you inspired for what's to come | Sarah van Gelder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/31/10-hopeful-things-2013-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/31/10-hopeful-things-2013-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"10 hopeful things from 2013 that will get you inspired for what's to come","bodyText":"There was something almost apocalyptic about 2013. Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines, the strongest storm ever recorded on land. It killed more than 6,000 people and affected millions. But it was just one of the 39 weather-related disasters costing $1bn or more in 2013. In Australia, record high temperatures forced mapmakers to create a new color on the weather map. Massive wildfires swept through California, historic flooding took out bridges and roadways in Colorado, and tornadoes swept through the Midwest, destroying towns like Moore, Oklahoma. Millions of people are on the move, seeking to escape the effects of climate-related disasters. CO2 concentrations passed 400 parts per million for the first time this year, and yet governments have done little to curb emissions. Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of dollars – much of it from secret sources – flow to climate-denier thinktanks and advocacy groups. Pop culture often explores a change before politicians do, and 2013 saw a rash of post-apocalyptic movies– from World War Z to Oblivion – and zombie apocalypse role-playing games. Much happened that was hopeful this year – a new pope focused on inequality, successful minimum wage campaigns spread across the country, and the number of states allowing gay marriage doubled. But responses to the threat of the climate crisis lead off this year's top stories as we look at seeds sown this year that could make 2014 transformational. 1. We saw surprising new leadership on the climate issue In northeast Nebraska, Native Americans and local ranchers formed a new alliance to resist the Keystone XL pipeline. Seven thousand activists gathered in Pittsburgh to press for action on a wide range of environmental justice issues. Students across North America persuaded nine colleges and universities to divest from fossil fuel companies. Hundreds of climate activists walked out of the COP19 climate talks in Poland to hold their own climate talks. The governors of California, Oregon, Washington, and the Canadian province of British Columbia have committed to taking action on the climate crisis. But Congress remains deadlocked and in denial, and climate scientists – when they let down their careful professional demeanor – express astonishment that world governments have failed to act on what is fast becoming a global emergency. A new potential ally is coming from an unexpected source. Some investors are beginning to worry that fossil fuel companies may not be a good bet. Investors worry about a \"carbon bubble\". The reserves of oil, gas, and coal counted as assets by the big energy corporations would be enormously destructive to life on Earth if they were allowed to burn. Many believe that new regulation or pricing will keep a large portion of those reserves safely in the ground. If that happens, the companies' reserves, and thus their stock, may be worth far less than believed. Savvy investors are placing their bets elsewhere: Warren Buffett, for example, is investing $1bn in wind energy, which, along with solar energy, is looking better all the time. 2. Native peoples took the lead in the fossil fuel fight In response to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's attempt to ramp up fossil fuel extraction on Native lands, Idle No More blossomed across Canada this year. First Nations people held flash mob round dances, blockaded roads, and appealed to government at all levels to protect land and water. And it's not just Canada. In Washington state, the Lummi Tribe is among those resisting massive new coal transport infrastructure, which would make exported coal cheap to burn in Asia. In Nebraska, the Ponca Tribe is teaming up with local ranchers to resist construction of the Keystone tar sands pipeline. Indigenous peoples in the Amazon, the Andes, Malaysia, the Niger Delta, and elsewhere are also at the front lines of resistance to yet more dangerous fossil fuel extraction. Many are turning to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples and the new Rights of Nature movement for support. Indigenous peoples developed ways of life that could sustain human life and the natural environment over thousands of years. The rest of the world is starting to recognize the critical importance of these perspectives, and there is growing willingness to listen to the perspectives of indigenous peoples. 3. The middle and lower classes fought for economic justice Income inequality is reaching levels not seen since the Roaring Twenties. People stuck in long-term unemployment are running out of options, and those who do find work often can't cover basic living expenses. The issue is now getting attention from mainstream media, becoming one of the defining issues of our time, as President Obama said. Now a movement is building to create a new economy that can work for all. Voters this year passed minimum wage laws in SeaTac, Washington, ($15 an hour) and the state of New Jersey. An overwhelming majority favors raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour. Domestic workers won the right to a minimum wage after years of organizing. The message was also clear in the election of Bill de Blasio, a founder of the Working Families Party, as mayor of New York City. Inequality is a top plank of his platform and his public record. At the national level, Senator Elizabeth Warren's defense of the rights of student borrowers and her proposal to strengthen Social Security (instead of weaken it, as leaders in both parties are discussing) is winning widespread support. There is even talk of drafting Warren to run for president. 4. A new economy is in the making At the grassroots, National People's Action and the New Economy Institute are leading new conversations about what it takes to build an economy that works for all and can function in harmony with the environment. Thousands of people are taking part. And a growing cooperatives movement is linking up with unions and social movements. Some are working with large \"anchor\" institutions, like hospitals and universities, that can provide a steady market for their products and services. Credit unions, too, are proving their value as they keep lending to local businesses and homeowners as Wall Street-owned banks pulled back. And a new DIY sharing economy is taking off, as people do peer-to-peer car-sharing, fundraising, and skill-sharing, and bring open-source technology to new levels. 5. US military strikes didn't happen The big news of the year may be the two wars the United States refused to instigate. The United States did continue its drone strikes, and the civilian casualties are causing an international uproar, with some calling for an outright ban on drones. And military spending continues to devastate the country's budget. (The United States spent more on the military in 2013 than China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, India, Germany, Italy, and Brazil combined.) Few dared to call for the same fiscal discipline from the military and its many contractors as they expect from schools and services for the poor. On the other hand, the United States stepped back from the brink of military strikes against Syria and Iran – a step in the right direction. 6. Pope Francis called for care and justice for the poor And for an end to the idolatry of money and consumerism. He also criticized \"ideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.\" In his \"Evangelii Gaudium\" he says: Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills. This call is provoking outrage from Rush Limbaugh and Fox News commentators, but elsewhere, it's leading to a new questioning of the moral foundation for a system that concentrates wealth and power while causing widespread poverty. 7. Gays and lesbians got some respect On 26 June, the Supreme Court struck down key provisions of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. Today, married gay couples are entitled to federal benefits once reserved for straight couples. The year saw a doubling of the number of states allowing gay marriages, and a third of all Americans now live in such states. Support for gay marriage has flipped from a slight majority opposing it to a majority now supporting the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry. As a wider range of gender identities has become acceptable, men and women, gay and straight, are freer to shed gender stereotypes without fear of bullying and humiliation. 8. There were new openings for a third party Just 26% of Americans believe the Democratic and Republican parties are doing \"an adequate job,\" according to an October Gallup poll; 60% say a third party is needed. Eighty-five percent disapprove of the job Congress is doing. Even cockroaches (along with zombies, hemorrhoids, and Wall Street) have a higher approval rating according to a recent poll by Public Policy Polling. But it's not the Tea Party that Americans are looking to as the alternative. Support for the Tea Party has fallen: in an October NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 21% of respondents had a favorable view of the party. New space has opened for independent political work – the Working Families Party (see #3 above) is an especially interesting model. 9. Alternatives to Obamacare are in the works Democratic leadership believed that the big profits the Affordable Care Act guaranteed to private insurance companies would make the act popular with conservatives. But the resulting system, with all its complications and expenses – and requirements – is frustrating millions. There are features that benefit ordinary people, but it compares poorly to the simpler and more cost-effective systems that exists in most of the developed world. Canadian-style single-payer health care, for example, had the support of a majority of Americans. Some jurisdictions are still looking for alternatives. Cooperative health insurance is available in some states and others are working to establish statewide single-payer healthcare. 10. An education uprising began The momentum behind the education reform agendas of Presidents Bush (No Child Left Behind) and Obama (Race to the Top) is stalling. The combination of austerity budgets, an ethic of blame directed at teachers, high-stakes testing, and private charter schools has stressed teachers and students – but it has not resulted in improved performance. Seattle's Garfield High School teachers, students, and parents launched an open rebellion last spring, joining a handful of others in refusing to administer required standardized tests. The movement is spreading around the country, with more rebellions expected in the spring of 2014. We live in interesting times, indeed. The growing climate emergency could eclipse all the other issues, and the sooner we get on it, the more we can use the transition for innovations that have other positive spin-offs.

To reach it, you have to drive along a rough, mile-long road, which in stretches has collapsed because of the winter storms that pounded the shingle spit. You must have had a devastating winter, I say when I eventually find the cottage. Not devastating, he insists, despite having been cut off by floods for four days, fascinating. Which sums up Jim Lovelock perfectly. The inventor/scientist/environmentalist is captivated by and curious about everything, which is why at 94 he radiates joie de vivre. He is the youngest 94-year-old you could ever hope to meet. His new book, A Rough Ride to the Future, is part memoir of his long life in science and part prediction of whether humankind can survive. I had intended to ask him whether it was a final testament, but the question dies in my throat. He so obviously doesn't plan his life that way. He has mastered the art of getting old by not giving it a moment's thought. The concept for which Lovelock is best known is Gaia – the idea that the Earth is a single, self-regulating entity in which the organic and inorganic interact to sustain life. He developed the idea in the 1960s when he was working for Nasa and has returned to it frequently; he says defending it from detractors is one reason he carries on writing. \"I want to keep fighting the battle because the academics just won't buy it, whereas most other people have.\" Lovelock, who for the past 50 years has been what he calls an \"independent scientist\" unfettered by institutional links, reckons he knows why academics reject Gaia. \"It's political,\" he says. \"You can't run a university unless it's divided into subjects. If you try and teach the whole lot, it becomes a complete mess and the vice-chancellor goes mad, so they have to divide it up. But if you divide it up, you can't understand it.\" Lovelock, who trained as a chemist but is just as interested in and likely to expound upon physics and biology, detests academic compartmentalisation. \"The universities,\" he says, \"have reached a point similar to the monasteries in the middle ages where the monks counted the number of angels that could stand on the head of a needle.\" The thesis underpinning A Rough Ride to the Future is what Lovelock calls \"accelerated evolution\". He argues that Thomas Newcomen's invention of the steam engine in the early 18th century was as significant in evolutionary terms as the emergence of the first photosynthesisers more than 3bn years ago, ushering in an age in which human activity has had a rapid and profound effect on the planet. \"The changes in the environment that we see as adverse – from rising carbon dioxide abundance, climate change and population growth – are,\" he writes, \"all consequences of this new [evolutionary] inflation; as may be economic instability and the tendency of the human species to become city or nest animals.\" He cites Moore's law, which states that a computer's processing power doubles every two years, and says we, too, will have to adapt to this speeded-up world. Man likes to assume he is the end of the evolutionary cycle, but dinosaurs, who held sway for almost 150m years, probably laboured under the same misconception. In the book, Lovelock posits the idea that one consequence of accelerated evolution could be that at some point we ourselves incorporate inorganic elements in our bodies. \"Instead of robots going to war with us and taking over the world, which is the way it's always portrayed in science fiction,\" he says, \"I thought, what happens if we join with them?\" I express a polite degree of incredulity, but he persists. \"It's already happening. I've got a pacemaker, which is a very handy device and works like a dream. I'm beginning to regard it almost as part of my body, and don't think about it. My pacemaker is an old-fashioned one. It has a battery that lasts 10 years and has to be replaced, but already pacemakers are starting to be thought about that use the body system to provide the energy to keep them going. It's coupled to the physiology of my body more or less completely, and, much more sinister, it has a radio communication with the outside world so that the technician can check it every year to see whether it's working. This really bothers me, because I can see it's only a short time before my body's on the internet and receiving spam. Once you go in for this endosymbiosis with the mechanical world, you're in for trouble, and we've started.\" Lovelock, who manages to be both playful and deadly serious at the same time, is almost converting me to the idea. \"Computers are getting more and more organic all the time,\" he says. \"They are being made from carbon, and I can envisage a process whereby an endosymbiotic person with these things in it will sufficiently fuse the two life systems together that it will become a single person that will breed true.\" I ask when this startling development might occur, but he prefers not to make a prediction. Cue further incredulity on my part. \"Dash it all,\" he says, \"we're pretty odd when you think that we started off 3bn years ago as single cells floating around.\" If academics dismiss the notion of Gaia, how are they going to react to Lovelock's projection of robo-people? Won't they just dismiss him as a crank? \"I'm sure some will,\" he admits, \"but that's why I've always been an independent scientist.\" If he was part of an academic institution, he says, he would never be able to explore the wilder shores of science. He left the Medical Research Council in the early 1960s, when he felt it was becoming more restrictive. \"I wanted to be free. I could see tramlines of security going on to retirement and the grave. It was very selfish and very stupid of me in many ways.\" Stupid because he was by no means wealthy, had four children, and soon after quitting his job his first wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But happily the US rescued him with offers of work at both Nasa and Hewlett-Packard, and his career as a freelance scientist-inventor was launched. Lovelock's pursuit of freedom had begun even earlier. The son of working-class parents who ran an art shop, he grew up in Brixton, south London, \"hated school like poison\", and taught himself science from books in the local library. He says he wanted to be a scientist from the age of four when his father gave him a primitive electronics set, and reckons the sense of science as a vocation that motivated him has largely disappeared. \"The whole system of teaching has lost it, because it's taught as if you were going into a career. It isn't a career and never should be. I've never had a career. One lives from day to day, and doesn't think about it too much. That's why at approaching 95 I don't think about ageing and death. I just think, 'What's the next job?'\" Lovelock had a heart attack 30 years ago and has had surgery on 40 occasions since, so to be in such good shape at 94 is miraculous. Ageing is inevitable, and doesn't worry him in the slightest. \"Everything's running down, so enjoy it while you can. It's not a gloomy thought at all. You wouldn't have energy to do things unless things were running down.\" He is thinking of planets as well as people. \"Earth is about as old as me if you look at it in comparative terms. It doesn't have long to go. It could be as little as 100m years, though I think it's more likely to be about 500m. As things age, they become much more vulnerable to disturbance. If someone as old as me gets pneumonia, it'll probably kill me, whereas if you're young you'll shrug it off. It's the same with planets. If there was an asteroid impact as big as the one 65m years ago, it would be quite dodgy. The older a planet gets, the less capable it is of resisting such an event. Life gets more complex and more vulnerable to disturbance.\" Shouldn't this news worry us? \"Of course it shouldn't worry us. If we [as a species] are still around in 100m years, it would be amazing.\" He doubts whether anything resembling man will still be around, but even that can't dent his essential optimism. \"I don't mind the thought that a hundred progeny from now I'll be unrecognisable,\" he says. There will, he reassures me, be a bit of us left in whatever emerges, just as the DNA of those first cells from 3bn years ago feature strongly in our own DNA. Lovelock's new book is likely to be claimed by both sides in the climate change debate. He has pulled back from the alarmist predictions of The Revenge of Gaia, published in 2006, and now says the rate of global warming is slower than he anticipated. \"I was a little too certain in that book,\" he admits. \"You just can't tell what's going to happen.\" He says the oceans store most of the heat from the sun, tempering the impact on the atmosphere, and our lack of understanding of the likely effects of the warming of the oceans makes it very difficult to predict the long-term impact. \"It could be terrible within a few years, though that's very unlikely, or it could be hundreds of years before the climate becomes unbearable.\" Won't this give succour to climate change deniers? \"It's just as silly to be a denier as it is to be a believer,\" he says. \"You can't be certain.\" He says climate change scientists should adopt the same level of statistical stringency as exists in medicine. So we need to take the politics out of climate science? \"Oh sure, but we're tribal animals. We can't help being political.\" I suggest to Lovelock, who dislikes the fetishisation of eco-causes, that he has a complicated relationship with the environmental movement. \"Not really,\" he insists. \"I'm an old-fashioned green, a person who's happy with that Selborne character, Gilbert White [the 18th-century parson, writer and pioneering naturalist]. I'm very old, and the British countryside up until world war two was glorious. It was heathland all the way from London to the coast, and you could walk everywhere. Humans and the countryside were in a wonderful equilibrium. We were just another animal in the place, but it got wrecked with the coming of cars.\" Lovelock sees environmentalism today as a form of what he calls \"urban politics\". \"It's become a religion,\" he says, \"and religions don't worry too much about facts.\" He is an enthusiast for nuclear power, which makes him unpopular with many greens. \"I'm a scientist and an inventor, and it is absurd to reject nuclear energy,\" he says. \"It all comes from the religious side. They feel guilty about dropping atom bombs on people. Here was this extraordinary gift given to humans – a safe, cheap source of power – and it gets horribly abused right at the start. We're still playing out the guilt feelings about it. But it's sad because we in Britain could now be having cheap energy if we'd gone on building [nuclear power stations].\" Nuclear waste? \"It isn't a problem,\" he insists. \"Sandy and I were invited to France, and we stood on 25 years of nuclear waste at La Hague. I had my own handheld monitor to check whether they were bullshitting me about it, and it was showing about the same reading as I was getting in this room. It was completely safe. The Swiss did a study of the number of deaths per year in all the various power systems, and nuclear beats everything.\" What about the meltdown at Fukushima in 2011? \"That's the most amazing collection of lies ever known,\" he says. \"There is virtually no wildlife damage anywhere near Fukushima. Levels [of radiation] are much too low. Nobody was killed, nobody was even hurt, so what was all the fuss about? It's all propaganda. People badmouth nuclear so nobody dares use it.\" He also supports fracking, but only as a second-best to nuclear power. \"The government is too frightened to use nuclear, renewables won't work because we don't have enough sun, and we can't go on burning coal because it produces so much CO2, so that leaves fracking. It produces only a fraction of the amount of CO2 that coal does, and will make Britain secure in energy for quite a few years. We don't have much choice.\" Lovelock is usually considered to be an opponent of wind power, but he says that's not quite true. He doesn't object in principle, but thinks wind turbines are an inefficient way to produce energy, and doesn't believe the results justify the despoilation of his beloved English countryside. Solar energy? Terrific, he says – in the desert. \"Europe could get all its energy from the Sahara, but politics screws it. A solar farm 100 miles by 100 miles could supply energy for the whole of Europe, but terrorists would blow it up.\" Turning all the lights in Europe off, he points out, would be an even bigger coup for al-Qaida than knocking down the Twin Towers. Lovelock manages to be both catastrophist and boundless optimist at the same time. He believes humanity will suffer crises that threaten the species, but will somehow pull through. \"We shouldn't worry too much about terrible disasters because they've happened in the past [when we may have been down to just a few thousand individuals] and we've come back. We are an extraordinarily special species, the first to harvest information.\" So we will survive – at least until evolution turns us into something else a few million years down the road? \"Oh sure,\" he says, the afternoon sun bathing his still surprisingly youthful face in light. \"As a species, we're cunning bastards.\" • An exhibition, Unlocking Lovelock: Scientist, Inventor, Maverick, opens at the Science Museum on 9 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-enterprise-network/small-business-blog/2013/may/23/social-media-five-lessons-entrepreneurs","type":"article","sectionId":"small-business-network","sectionName":"Guardian Small Business Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-23T09:45:22Z","webTitle":"Five social media tips for social entrepreneurs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/small-business-blog/2013/may/23/social-media-five-lessons-entrepreneurs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-enterprise-network/small-business-blog/2013/may/23/social-media-five-lessons-entrepreneurs","fields":{"headline":"Five social media tips for social entrepreneurs","bodyText":"Young, new social entrepreneurs around the world face a similar problem: building an audience and sustaining virtual communities. With social media playing an important role in audience building, early-stage entrepreneurs have begun to focus on popular networking sites to leverage engagement and maximise reach. Yet this is the reason that most early enterprises often fail in garnering public interest. Peter W Roberts, the academic director of social enterprise at the Goizueta Business School of Emory University, pointed out in the Harvard Business Review that there was a definite link between successful enterprises and an established social media presence. He also suggested that the success of most of these enterprises often depended on factors relating to age [of the entrepreneur], sector and approach. However, my own learning has been different. Here are my top five social media tips for social entrepreneurs. 1. Organisation v cause Most emerging enterprises focus on promoting their organisation instead of the cause. While the former is necessary, it fails to make a personal connect. Prakhar Bhartiya, the founder of Youth Alliance, told me that credibility was one of the biggest challenges when he started his organisation over a year ago. \"We get around 60% of our applications on Facebook because our viral reach is high. But, initially, we had to rely on newspaper coverage or visibility through established organisations to validate the work we do,\" he said, \"We focused on the cause we were supporting, and today, since we can boast of impact, we use it to promote our organisation. This worked for us.\" The trick to good organisational visibility is to allow people to understand your vision and not just your venture. Cause-driven organisations enjoy a high-recall value and have often sailed the social media wave effortlessly. 2. The digital disconnect Since audience building and participation largely happens online, another challenge that young entrepreneurs face is the sheer lack of physical interaction with their audience. Young social entrepreneurs such as Kuldeep Dantewadia, founder of Reap Benefit, an organisation that focuses on low-cost waste management solutions, are still sceptical about the right use of social media communities. \"For us, word of mouth has achieved the best impact. Social media is merely a validating factor. It works as a platform to spark interest rather than induce action,\" he said. \"Facebook lets us know that people are interested. But this interest doesn't translate into an impulse to act.\" On Twitter, too, targeted audience building seems a distant dream for those who work on the ground. \"Twitter is great for conversations. But I work mostly with rural schools, and my audience, primarily school children, are absent from Twitter,\" Kuldeep said. \"We simply didn't know how to position Reap Benefit on Twitter, so now we use it to chronicle our work instead.\" 3. Personality v problem A good way to tell when an organisation is moving away from its goal is when its social media maintains a central focus entirely on the person behind the organisation. This diverts an audience attention from the problem and allows the audience to favour the personality behind the cause. For instance, when one talks of Selco online, it is easy to associate the organisation with Harish Hande, its founder, instead of its great work in the field of solar energy. 4. Competition v collaboration In recent years, overcrowding has led to a pressure to compete in the Indian social sector. Organisations that focus on similar social causes usually work parallel to each other when leveraging their online communities to highlight their own unique approaches to problems. But the audience eventually drifts, looking for newer interests. Healthy collaborations and strategic partnerships with other players in the sector online will encourage dialogue and create a synergy among online communities. Medhavi Gandhi, who founded the Happy Hands Foundation to help create sustainable livelihoods, is a great example. Through her work, she focused on cross-sector dialogues with the corporate world and involved them through gift giving. These partnerships helped validate her organisation's online presence as well. 5. Success v excess Early-stage enterprises also make the mistake of prioritising reach while building online communities. Scheduling tools for Twitter and Facebook adverts are seen as fantastic, easy options to reach big numbers. But this doesn't help in driving engagement. And engagement is crucial to sustaining online communities. Inclusivity ensures that an audience stays interested and adds value to your organisation's outreach. Leveraging two-way communication through active forums such as Google groups or Facebook groups makes sure that conversation with the audience isn't stifled. If there is an excess of information being generated one way, it's possible to misinterpret those numbers that organisations think they are reaching. So what is the secret to establishing a solid presence online? In all honesty, it is hard to tell. Every organisation's needs differ, as do its priorities. The key, however, is to identify the exact space where entrepreneurs can communicate their core message. Social media platforms can often tempt with numbers, but there's often more to numbers than meets the eye. Meera Vijayann handles online communications for Ashoka India.

So I am pleased to hear the Committee on Climate Change confirm that this is a huge red herring (Annual energy bills 'to rise by £190 by 2020', 15 December). I believe this co-ordinated campaign has been orchestrated by those interests who seem to be determined to stop the positive, clean, sustainable and huge economic potential that exists with developing renewable forms of energy. The parallel benefit of promoting energy efficiency should be welcomed in reducing the alarming rise in fuel poverty, and it will directly help to cut fuel bills. It is interesting therefore to read on the Guardian's website (Environment blog, 14 December) a Sunday Times YouGov poll, hardly reported by the Sunday Times, that shows strong support for renewables over nuclear and fossil fuels. The poll shows huge support for developing more solar power (74%), just when government has cut the popular feed-in tariffs (FITs), and strong support for more wind power (56%). This compares to support for new nuclear at just 35%, with a majority 50% wanting to see either no more nuclear power stations or a total phase-out. Oil and coal come out even less favourably. Why do we not hear about such figures across the UK media? The government should look at them, and start amending its energy policies accordingly. Councillor Brian Goodall Chair, Nuclear Free Local Authorities • 12 December 2011 was a dark day for Britain – the day Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, slashed solar subsidies, while proclaiming what a good result Britain had achieved at the climate change conference in Durban. Huhne claims the cost of solar panels has halved, and that therefore the subsidy (FIT) should be halved. But solar panels are only half the cost of installation, so even if panel prices have halved, which is doubtful, the total cost of investment has reduced by only a quarter. Huhne also claimed the original FIT of 43.3p per kilowatt generated was too generous. Not so! The rate of return over 25 years, including the cost of the original investment, is a reasonable 6%. Who will take investment risks when the effective rate of return is 3%? Huhne's decision to bring the tariff change forward by nearly four months has thrown personal investment plans into disarray, and created mistrust of the government's intentions, not only for solar but also wind applications. The fact is, we need solar energy now to meet our Kyoto obligations. Huhne has betrayed the green agenda. John Urquhart Newcastle upon Tyne • So the wealthy people fortunate enough to be in a position to splash out in excess of £10,000 and enjoy the huge benefits of solar panel installation are now up in arms about the government rethink of tariffs. Spare a thought for the millions of poor people who will continue in fuel poverty without a hope of ever being able to afford these benefits. It is another example of the growing economic divide: similarly those wealthy enough to enjoy a new car have little or no road tax due to emission regulations, while poorer people who have to run old cars pay the full amount of tax. G Randall Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire • If you rely on Murdoch sources, Australia's \"carbon tax\" may well \"look like a trip to the moral high ground at the expense of international competitiveness\" (Editorial, 13 December). But in fact the policy is quite gradualist: trade-exposed emitters receive a 94% discount for the foreseeable future, and eventually polluters will be able to buy foreign carbon credits if that's cheaper than cleaning up domestically. Rather than aiming for a big bang reduction in emissions, the point of the policy is to build supply lines for low-carbon technologies. This is a prudent goal. Whether due to rising temperatures or rising exports to Asia, it is unlikely that in 20 years' time Australia will be able to justify burning coal to power domestic air conditioners. Adrian Pellas-Rice Whipstick, Victoria, Australia • Your leader doesn't give credit for a scheme that is likely inform the roadmap towards a global agreement on emissions reduction. The carbon tax is a four-year transition measure leading to an emissions trading scheme, so it fits with any future settlement on climate. Australian farmers have begun to move towards carbon-sequestering farming, including green manures, biochar and other techniques that will restore soil carbon and reverse the damaging deforestation, soil degradation and consequent greenhouse gas emissions of the past century. These \"carbon farming\" credits will be bought at a minimum floor price of A$23 per tonne by carbon-emitting industry. This makes far more sense than the EU system of issuing excessive emissions permits to industry while subsidising agricultural practices that increase CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions. Australia's carbon tax is the first emissions reduction system that doesn't pick winners and losers, and so is free of political dictates. As such, it will stimulate investment in genuine climate mitigation efforts. Craig Sams Executive chairman, Carbon Gold • Michael Jacobs says \"only … investment in low carbon technologies and other emission-reducing activities\" will cut greenhouse gas emissions (Hope at last in Durban, 12 December). But such technologies have not helped so far, and are unlikely to in future. This is due to the Jevons paradox – energy efficiency cuts costs, and so increases consumption – and the fact that possible savings are dwarfed by growth in energy consumption in countries such as China and India. There is no realistic prospect of valuable fossil fuels being left in the ground, so the best strategy for tackling climate change is to mitigate the damage caused by their burning. We need to invest in carbon capture and storage, and geoengineering.

Urban centers – which together occupy just 2% of the world's land and contain 51% of the human population – produce up to 70% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and have become the main climate-change battleground, according to a UN report. Across the world, cities are working to meet that challenge. Officials are partnering with engineers and corporate R&amp;D teams to improve access to essential resources like water, energy and sunlight, and to boost social and environmental wellbeing. They are reimagining the potential of resources – the existing structures and systems – and they've already come up with innovative solutions to meet changing urban needs. Together, they are reprogramming the city. Take Lima. For those living on the edges of Peru's capital, access to clean drinking water is a problem. Small wells supply most of the water, which one resident describes as \"unpleasant and polluted\", and in the summer \"there isn't much available\". Engineers at the local University of Engineering and Technology (UTEC) decided to tackle the issue by making better use of two of the city's more abundant resources: the costal air (which can reach 98% humidity), and the billboards that stretch into it. They installed a humidity collector and water purifier into the top of one advertising structure in the village of Bujama, creating the UTEC Water Billboard. It can produce 96 litres of clean drinking water a day for local residents, which flows down a pipe to a tap at the base of the structure. Resident Francisco Quilca says the billboard has provided him and his neighbors with a new, pure water source, one he wishes could exist \"on the door of every house, in every village\". Funded through the college's Ingenuity in Action initiative, the project aims to inspire children in the area to pursue engineering studies at the college, exploring alternative approaches to urban infrastructure. Nader Tubbeh, digital marketing coordinator at UTEC, says he hopes – through perfecting such innovations – young engineers can \"help undermine the water crisis currently affecting the world\". Seven thousand miles away, the residents of Umea, a city 300 miles north of Stockholm in Sweden, spend six months each year with little access to another precious natural resource: sunlight. This can take its toll on the population's mental and physical health. What the city lacks in sunlight, however, it makes up for in busses and bus stops – popular among people seeking shelter from the elements in winter. Local energy company, Umea Energi, saw an opportunity in the intersection of the need for sunlight and for shelter. It replaced the lights in the shells of 30 bus stops around the city with UV-light-therapy tubes powered by solar energy. This transformed the bus stops into therapy saloons \"to give the people of Umea an extra energy boost when they needed it the most\", as the company explains in a video about the project. While waiting for their bus, residents are invited to face the lights for a few minutes to soak up artificial sunlight rays before continuing on their journey. After the installation of the light therapy bulbs, the use of public buses in Umea increased by 50%. The motorways in and around Los Angeles may not seem like the most fertile ground for this kind of urban repurposing, but for artist Stephen Glassman, they hold a unique potential. Glassman is the creator of Urban Air, a project that aims to replace the advertisements atop the structures that line and extend over some of America's most polluted roadways with miniature bamboo forests to cool and clean the air. The project, explains Glassman, \"recontextualizes what we've seen to this point as a blight of advertising\". Instead, these sites become \"an infrastructure for service and inter-connectivity\". Time is a great decider of what stays and what disappears from the urban landscape. As technology and social behaviour changes, so do the physical elements of the city. Changing media habits led to the disappearance of newspaper boxes. Phone booths and emergency call sites have given way to the mobile phone – but these skeletal structures offer a space for innovation to bring new social and economic value. The rise of the \"Internet of Things\" – in which everyday objects are embedded with sensors and Wi-Fi-enabled – is contributing to the potential. A partnership between New York City and two telecommunications companies, Cisco and City 24/7, has seen 250 phone boxes repurposed as information point touchscreens. The business model replaces coins with advertising: a person might tap on the screen to find the way to the nearest park and also be alerted to offers from local shops and restaurants, which can be stored on their smartphone. The information points can also act as communication tools during emergencies. If this pilot test is successful, all of the city's 12,500 payphones could be replaced. Meanwhile, Telekom Austria has found another use for hundreds of its disused phone booths in Vienna. The company is converting them into electric-car-charging stations that give drivers the option of paying via SMS text messaging. Parking payment machines are next on the list of \"endangered\" structures ripe for reprogramming. These iron sentinels are rapidly being replaced by smartphone apps that allow GPS location-specific payments. Yet look inside a modern parking-payment machine and you will find a networked Wi-Fi system, a computer, printer, GPS locator and a payment authorization system – all powered by a solar system and storage battery. Those capabilities could be used for more than just issuing pieces of paper with bits of time. One idea called City Tickets, by designer Mayo Nissen, enables residents to report incidents or problems in the area – such as potholes or broken streetlights – and suggest improvements. Earlier this year, Nissen demonstrated a prototype in Boston: the parking payment machine had been reprogrammed to connect to the city's 311 incident reporting system, creating a street-level communication platform between residents and City Hall. Residents can now pay for their parking and print out a list of all the faults or incidents reported in the area, as well as a report from the city authorities detailing how they are responding to each issue. A separate ticket, which allows residents to report incidents in the area or offer suggestions for improvements, such as perhaps benches for sitting on or a weekly local market, can also be printed. Back in New York, numerous scaffolding structures, aka \"sidewalk sheds\", can be left standing for years as a result of a local law that requires regular inspection of building facades. The law states that the structures must be erected for the inspection, but it doesn't clarify when they must come down. Brooklyn designers Bland Hoke and Howard Chambers saw an opportunity to rethink these structures, having been inspired by the way the city was rethinking its streets. In Hoke's words: \"We recognized how New York City streetscapes were changing with the addition of chairs and tables, and how the city was turning streets into pedestrian plazas, so we took that concept and grafted it onto sidewalk sheds.\" The result was Softwalks, a kit of seats, benches, counter tops and planters that bolt onto existing scaffolding structures to transform them into spaces for social gatherings or personal relaxation. The various elements that make up Softwalks, Hoke continues: \"are very pragmatic additions to these otherwise mundane structures, but the impact they've had so far is pretty tremendous in terms of how people react to them. Everyone loves it, because you are transforming a eyesore into a community asset.\" This citizen-led transformation of scaffolding structures into platforms for public events, street trading or pop-up dining could be a model for more public engagement with existing urban structures. It could even encourage the authorities to add a new chapter to the New York City Street Design Manual to nurture these interactions. At present, this fairly standard municipal catalogue offers few surprises in its detailing of the \"policies and design guidelines…for the improvement of streets and sidewalks throughout the five boroughs\". Yet deep within the guide is a section titled \"Infrastructure: Do It Yourself Repairs\", complete with \"Specifications for Residents Installing their Own Sidewalk\", and guidelines for public \"Sidewalk Maintenance and Repair\". The notion of DIY infrastructure repair begs the question: if residents are encouraged to install and repair their own sidewalks (within certain guidelines), what other pieces of urban infrastructure could be opened up by the city within a framework of repair and improvement? Cities are often celebrated as terrains of infinite possibility – a perspective mostly applied to their human potential, but also true of the structures, systems and services that underpin urban lives. But cities also face tough challenges: from population growth and congestion, to emissions targets and economic competition. As existing resources come under pressure, innovators who can stretch their applications in new directions will be rewarded. Scott Burnham has created and directed design and urban initiatives in 11 cities worldwide, including Boston's recent Reprogramming the City exhibition.

After a Guardian report on Sunday, the government announced it will launch a \"fast-track\" review of the feed-in tariff scheme, which was launched only last April. The scheme subsidises households that install solar panels or other small- and medium-scale renewable energy projects. But ministers say that too many companies are planning to build \"solar farms\", where fields are filled with solar panels, which would take up funds intended for households. In response, the Renewable Energy Association (REA) said that the large-scale solar projects for housing associations, schools and hospitals that are going through the planning system would generate almost twice as much electricity as the planned solar farms. These projects are likely to be suspended or even scrapped while there is uncertainty about the level of pay-out they would receive, the REA said. Gaynor Hartnell, the association's chief executive, said: \"Some of our members have been talking about legal action when these concerns started to be raised about ground-mounted PV [photovoltaic].\" She added that companies were taking legal advice after Monday's confirmation of a review by the government but declined to name them. In last October's spending review, the government allocated £360m to the scheme for 2014/2015. Greg Barker, minister of state for climate change, told the Guardian that large-scale solar installers that were operational by the summer, when the review is expected to be completed, would continue to benefit from the subsidy even if it were cut for future projects. \"We are simply acting to ensure that all technologies get their fair share of funding and that funds aren't all hoovered up by one technology or a small group of people,\" he said. Next Energy Capital, an Italian company that is seeking to install solar farms in the UK, said that only large-scale projects can bring about the critical mass and amount of investment required to develop the UK's solar industry. In January, Cornwall council granted planning permission for its fourth solar farm – the 5MW Lanhydrock PV solar farm. Other counties, including Dorset, Devon and Cambridgeshire, also have proposals on the table. According to Cornwall council, more than 60 domestic and foreign companies have expressed an interest in developing solar farms in the county, the UK's sunniest. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, 22,500 renewable electricity projects, with a total capacity of 80MW – less than 0.1% of the UK's total electricity supply – benefit from the tariff. More than half this comes from solar, and the target is to increase this 50-fold by 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/jun/02/lobbying-ministers-scandals","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-02T19:54:47Z","webTitle":"Lobbying: ministers race to change rules as scandals hit home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/02/lobbying-ministers-scandals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jun/02/lobbying-ministers-scandals","fields":{"headline":"Lobbying: ministers race to change rules as scandals hit home","bodyText":"Two Labour peers were suspended from their parliamentary party on Sunday while a third peer – an Ulster Unionist – was forced to resign pending inquiries into allegations that they broke parliamentary rules by offering to carry out work for cash. The trio were punished as David Cameron brought forward stalled plans for a register of lobbyists in the wake of a gathering scandal across Westminster. Lord Cunningham, Lord Mackenzie and the Ulster Unionist Lord Laird face allegations that they offered to work with undercover journalists posing as lobbyists. All three deny any wrongdoing and have referred themselves to the House of Lords commissioner for standards. In an acknowledgement of the potential damage to public faith in the political system, coalition cabinet members repeated a pledge to find time in the legislative programme for a new law to extend lobbying transparency, government sources said. The coalition is planning to introduce laws to regulate lobbyists, and to give constituents the power to force a byelection if an MP is found to have engaged in serious wrongdoing. Cameron predicted in 2010 that lobbying would be \"the next scandal waiting to happen\" but has failed to introduce the promised law so far. The developments come after three days of disclosures which began when MP Patrick Mercer resigned the Tory whip after being stung by undercover reporters. All three main political parties are bracing themselves for further allegations to come on Thursday when the BBC's Panorama programme will broadcast further claims against politicians. As the sleaze crisis spreads, Nick Clegg must also decide the fate of Mike Hancock, the Liberal Democrat MP for Portsmouth South, who has been accused of sexual assault in a high court civil action. Hancock strongly denies all allegations against him and police dropped an investigation into him for lack of evidence. However, Clegg decided to take disciplinary action because of the serious nature of the accusations. If Hancock were to resign as an MP, it would trigger another difficult byelection for the Lib Dems just months after they had to fight Eastleigh. At present, Lords rules ban peers from seeking to profit from membership of the House of Lords by offering parliamentary advice or services. But the government has until now shied away from a three-year-old pledge to introduce a law that would allow greater scrutiny of parliamentarians' contacts with lobbyists. Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, said he would be astonished if the coalition had not enacted a lobbyists' register and a power to recall errant MPs by 2015. He suggested that legislation to create a lobbyists' register – which was not in the Queen's speech – could be brought forward to this session once details had been worked out. Cunningham, who was a Labour cabinet minister before becoming a peer in 2005, is alleged to have offered to write directly to the prime minister to push an agenda by lobbyists who were actually undercover Sunday Times reporters. He asked for £144,000 a year for his lobbying services, according to the newspaper, and was recorded telling reporters posing as representatives of a South Korean solar energy company that he would become their advocate in Westminster. \"Knocking on doors, introductions and getting to see the people, including if necessary the ministers – this is part of the package,\" he allegedly said. In response to the allegations, Cunningham said he had been testing his suspicions that he was being targeted by a scam when he met the undercover reporters. \"I quickly became suspicious of them and the money they were offering and sought to test my suspicions during the meeting. \"What the article does not make at all clear is that I told the undercover journalists that I always stick to the rules and declare any interests,\" he said in a statement. \"The article also fails to properly acknowledge the important fact that I informed them the next day that I wanted nothing more to do with them. That same day I notified Baroness Royall, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, and Lord Bassam, the chief whip, of my suspicions and what had occurred. I also reported to the clerk of the parliaments and the registrar of members' interests,\" he said. Mackenzie, Tony Blair's former law and order adviser, was accused of setting up a ruse that allowed him to host events for paying clients. The Sunday Times said that during the sham interview the peer was asked whether he could get around parliamentary rules that stop peers from booking events related to their financial interests. Mackenzie replied by saying that it was within the rules to ask someone else to host a party if it was for charitable causes. Defending his actions, Mackenzie told Sky's Murnaghan programme that the rules may have to be tightened up and that he would be vindicated by an investigation. \"Morally it may well look as though it's not right but to hold the function that's the only way you could do it,\" he said. \"I thought it was all right because it was a non-profit-making function, it was to do with saving energy, so it was important.\" On Sunday, Labour withdrew the party whip from both peers, pending an inquiry. Neither actually took any money from the Sunday Times undercover team. Laird was involved in two separate stings this weekend – one by the BBC's Panorama and another by the Sunday Times. In a statement, Laird said: \"I wish to make it clear that I did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the house, nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services.\" Mercer said he was taking legal advice but resigned the whip to save his party embarrassment, and will step down from the Commons at the next general election. He also referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. The MPs' code of conduct prohibits paid advocacy and requires the declaration of financial interests. The Tory MP for Monmouth, David Davies, said he was among those targeted by the Panorama sting but refused the offer of lobbying work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/jan/17/dark-snow-project-kicktstarter-greenland","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-17T09:50:00Z","webTitle":"'Dark snow' project turns to crowdfunding for Greenland expedition | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/jan/17/dark-snow-project-kicktstarter-greenland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/jan/17/dark-snow-project-kicktstarter-greenland","fields":{"headline":"'Dark snow' project turns to crowdfunding for Greenland expedition","bodyText":"There is already much excitement in the arts, media and beyond about the potential of crowdfunding - via sites such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo – to finance projects that might others have remained an unfulfilled dream. To date, though, few scientific expeditions have successfully utilised crowd-funding. The Dark Snow Project hopes to change this. Jason Box, a climatologist based at the Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University, is hoping to raise $150,000 over the coming months to pay for an expedition this summer up onto the \"ice dome\" of Greenland to gather samples of snow. The project's website explains: Dark Snow is a field and lab project to measure the impact of changing wildfire and industrial soot on snow and ice reflectivity. Soot darkens snow and ice, increasing solar energy absorption, hastening the melt of the \"cryosphere\". The climatic impact of \"black carbon\" and wildfire smoke is much in the news and yet remains little understood. Last year, Box presented satellite observations (pdf) showing how soot particles drifting from tundra wildfires spread across Greenland. The big as-yet-unanswered question is whether this soot contributed towards the region's record melt during the summer of 2012. And, if so, by how much. \"We saw complete surface melting of the [Greenland] ice sheet for the first time in observation. Would that have happened without the wildfire soot of 2012?\" Box told the Guardian in December. \"We don't know. We have got to get up there and make those measurements.\" Box has already raised more than $60,000, but is now turning to crowd-funding via the expedition's website to try and secure the remaining amount. Roughly two-thirds of this money, he says, will be spent on renting a plane to transport the team up onto the ice sheet. Here's the planned itinerary: 1. Prepare and gather science equipment including a field spectrometer, snow and ice coring device, and snow metrics kit. 2. Travel to Iqualuit, on Baffin Island, Nunavut from home locales in California, Ohio, Michigan, Vermont and rendezvous with Dash-6 \"Twin Otter\" ski-equipped airplane and flight crew. 3. Organize cold weather survival kit. 4. Ferry team from Iqualuit to Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. 5. Fly to and land at sampling sites high on the inland ice sheet. 6. At each site collect snow samples from a snow pit and obtain snow cores to a minimum depth of the previous year's snow surface, and record snow properties. 7. Transport of team and snow samples to Greenland's capital Nuuk, where the team will rest after hustling at field sites. 8. Return to Iqualuit, then to respective home locales to start the data analysis and reporting phase of campaign. Box has also invited Peter Sinclair along as a team-member, who, as \"Greenman3610\", is probably best known for his consistently excellent YouTube videos on climate change. (Sinclair produced the video above.) In the first instance, this will ensure that anyone who has made a donation will be kept up-to-date with the researchers' progress. But it will also mean the wider world will gain a better insight into not just the science being conducted, but also the environmental implications of soot settling on the Arctic snow and ice.

The departure of Ken Salazar as interior secretary leaves Obama with virtually a clean slate to remake his energy and environmental team. The only other original member of Obama's original green \"dream team\", the Nobel prize-winning energy secretary Steven Chu, is also expected to step down at the start of Obama's second term. As interior secretary, Salazar had a complicated relationship with environmentalists. As the executor of Obama's all-encompassing energy strategy, Salazar angered activists by approving coal and oil projects on public lands in the west, and allowing Shell to being drilling in Arctic waters. Potential successors included three governors – Colorado's Bill Ritter, Washington's Christine Gregoire and Montana's Brian Schweitzer – as well as the former North Dakota senator Byron Dorga and Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva, according to news reports. Salazar's biggest legacy after four years as secretary may well be the overhaul of a lax and out-dated regulatory regime for the country's offshore oil industry, after the 2010 BP oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. A number of inquiries in the wake of the disaster exposed a cozy relationship between industry and regulators. Under Salazar's direction, the corrupt and scandal-ridden Minerals Management Service was broken down into three independent agencies. \"We have undertaken the most aggressive oil and gas safety and reform agenda in US history, raising the bar on offshore drilling safety, practices and technology and ensuring that energy development is done in the right way and in the right places,\" Salazar said in his exit statement. But Salazar, after briefly closing down drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following the BP spill, went on to lease millions of acres of new areas for oil and gas development. As of Wednesday, he said, there was more drilling in the Gulf than even before the BP disaster. Salazar also over-rode objections from environmental groups and scientists and allowed Shell to begin preliminary drilling in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas last summer. Shell's readiness to drill in the harsh and remote environment of the Arctic was called into question after a series of equipment failures. Its oil-containment dome was crushed like a beer can in a test in Puget Sound. Salazar, in one of his final decisions as interior secretary, was forced to order a high-level, 60-day review of Shell's preparations and safety regime for Arctic oil drilling. He was on more solid footing with environmental groups regarding his support for renewable energy. He revived solar, wind and geothermal proposals that had stalled under George Bush, pushing through nearly three dozen new projects on public lands. He also opened up offshore wind development on the Atlantic coast. \"Today, the largest solar energy projects in the world are under construction on America's public lands in the sest, and we've issued the first leases for offshore wind in the Atlantic,\" Salazar said. \"I am proud of the renewable energy revolution that we have launched.\" In his statement, Salazar also spoke of his establishment of seven new national parks and 10 new wildlife refuges, and reforming laws for home ownership on Indian lands."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"housing-network/2012/jan/06/confusion-feed-in-tariff-social-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"housing-network","sectionName":"Housing Network","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-06T09:33:29Z","webTitle":"Confusion over FITs sets social housing projects back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/jan/06/confusion-feed-in-tariff-social-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/housing-network/2012/jan/06/confusion-feed-in-tariff-social-housing","fields":{"headline":"Confusion over FITs sets social housing projects back","bodyText":"Solar installation has been a surprising success for the UK. Despite our unpredictable weather, up and down the country solar panels are appearing on more and more roofs and causing none of the controversy generated by wind farms. The government has helped this growing industry through the payment of feed-in-tariffs (FITs), a subsidy allowing investors in small-scale renewables to sell units of the electricity produced to a supplier of their choice. Introduced in April 2010 by the previous Labour administration, the tariff was set at 43.3 pence per kWh. The FIT was an important factor in encouraging councils and housing associations to go ahead with renewable projects, and in particular solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Many saw it as a chance to tackle fuel poverty and meet carbon reduction obligations. Though fewer than 3,000 small-scale installations had been completed by mid-September, tens of thousands of projects were lined up for early 2012. Cut short But in October, the government announced a cut in FITs for schemes up to 4kW in size to 21 pence per kWh as part of an urgent effort to keep the scheme's budget under control. The government argued that a cut was necessary to reflect the plummeting costs of technology with an average domestic PV installation now costing 30% less than in April 2010. It was also prompted by a surge in households installing solar PV. \"Our proposals allow social housing and local authority organisations to claim a tariff which would provide a 5% rate of return on the investment, which is what the feed-in-tariff scheme was originally designed to generate,\" says a government spokesperson. \"The feed-in-tariff scheme was never intended to provide windfall profits.\" The new proposed tariffs will apply to all new solar PV installations registered after 12 December. These will receive the current tariff before moving to the lower rate on 1 April 2012. But anyone who installed and registered before 12 December will receive the early rate for 25 years. The abrupt announcement that the cut to the tariff would be larger and come earlier than expected was a blow both to the embryonic UK renewables industry and the social housing sector. Business plans for schemes based on the existing tariffs were torn up and installations cancelled – and it is now facing legal action over the plans. In court A government consultation on the tariff closed over Christmas. It considered two important aspects that will affect the housing sector's decision on how to proceed: whether an even lower tariff should be applied to schemes where an organisation receives payments from multiple installations on different sites, and whether more could be done to enable genuine community projects to be able to fully benefit from FITs. While the possible introduction of a lower tariff of 80% of the revised rate for multiple schemes would alarm landlords, the proposal of a higher tariff for community projects may offer them some encouragement. But there is another twist in the FIT saga. As the December cut-off point was dated two weeks before the end of the government's official consultation, legal challenges followed. The high court has heard applications from Friends of the Earth and two solar companies – Solarcentury and HomeSun – for permission to challenge government plans. In December it ruled that the government's plans to cut subsidies were legally flawed. The government is appealing the decision. Halting progress Research by the National Housing Federation found the planned changes have already stopped almost 18,000 schemes in their tracks. The organisation's policy leader on sustainable environments, Pippa Read, said: \"On the government's own assumptions, if the proposals to dramatically cut the FITs go ahead, it will make most social housing schemes financially unviable.\" Michelle Reid, chief executive at the Tenant Participation Advisory Service, says fuel poverty is one of the top concerns tenants face. \"Landlords and contractors have been proactive in introducing a variety of green initiatives to lower their carbon emissions and help tenants to cope with rising costs, yet this effort and innovation is not being rewarded. Once again, tenants will bear the brunt of the cuts, despite paying subsidies through their rising energy bills,\" she says. Some landlords have moved quickly to cancel or rethink projects. Leeds city council planned to install at least 1,000 solar panel systems on suitable council-owned homes, giving tenants free daytime electricity. But the council has decided to put the scheme on hold because the lower FIT will not be enough to repay the project's funders. Viridian Housing had planned to install solar panels on 1,300 homes before April 2012, which it estimates would have saved residents £180 a year on energy bills. Planning and investment manager Karl Linder says that Viridian may review its decision in next year should solar installation costs drop significantly further. \"The drop in FIT meant we have had to cancel the project,\" he explains. \"However we fully understand why the government did this. We don't think it is right that private business makes large returns on FIT-funded solar projects in the current financial climate.\" He urged the government to carefully consider how it can reward and support genuine community installation projects. Making plans Other landlords have yet to decide on how to proceed. Liverpool Mutual Homes is due to met to discuss the implications of the FIT rate on its Project Viridis, which would also install biomass boilers and external wall insulation. The organisation's chief executive, Steve Coffey, says the team \"remains positive\" despite the difficult circumstances. Wrexham council is continuing plans to installing solar panels on 3,000 of its homes. The council's executive board has agreed to proceed with installations as it is part of the council's corporate priority of reducing carbon emissions and energy use. The council has asked its contractor to complete as many installations as possible before the cut-off date, with the rest scheduled for completion before April. One organisation has already reacted to the changes by developing a system that makes solar installation more viable. Strategic Energy, which counts a number of housing associations as its clients, has come up with a scheme that reduces landlord's legal costs and speeds up installations. Strategic energy director Martin Davidson claims that there are no reasons for landlords to stop their solar schemes. \"Regardless of the financial incentives, the landlords we have worked with are keen to press ahead because they are meeting moral obligations by saving tenants up to £250 a year in fuel bills – a huge amount, particularly in the current economic climate – and environmentally they are reducing carbon emissions.\" \"Another key element is the job creation aspect,\" he adds. \"For every thousand installations we could employ a minimum of five people on a sustainable basis in landlord's communities.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Her first thoughts are of her children. \"For the first time, I can afford to educate them – which I wasn't planning to do... it's purely because of this mobile application that I'm able to,\" she said. Pushpaben was born into an agricultural existence in Gujarat, India but hasn't shared in the rising fortunes of her enterprising home state. It's only since becoming a small-scale saleswoman for a large Rural Distribution Network (RUDI) that she has come to experience the benefits of a steady income. But with the recent introduction of a simple mobile tool designed to increase sales, Pushpaben has seen a spike from around £3 (250 rupees) to an unprecedented £60 (5,000 rupees) a day. The RUDI cooperative was created by grassroots organisation 'SEWA' with the aim of economically empowering women through a fairer agricultural supply chain. After sourcing produce from local farmers at market prices, the RUDI network processes and packages the goods for a network of rural saleswomen (rudibens) to sell at affordable prices. Whilst being a successful and fast-growing model for around 2,000 rural businesswomen in Gujarat, certain aspects of their work, like travelling long distances for orders and supplies, restricted the number of sales. Armed with the will to help them manage their business better, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women collaborated with Vodafone India and SEWA to create a mobile tool that since January, has quadrupled the income of Pushpaben and other rural saleswomen. \"After listening to the women, and understanding where the blockages were, we developed a mobile business tool that relies on text messages and works on simple, unsophisticated phones the women were already using,\" explains Anant Nautiyal, Mobile Programme Director at the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women. The transformation in earnings has been rapid for Pushpaben. \"I used to spend most of my time going to the centre to place orders. Now, with 10 paisa per message I send, I can cover more villages and take more orders.\" Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that supporting women entrepreneurs has wider, positive social repercussions. Unlike men, women tend to invest 90 percent of their income back into their families and communities The micro-finance movement serves as a powerful illustration of how empowered women can drive change in their communities, even in the face of relentless socio-economic barriers. Whilst there is a clear macro-economic case for making simple transformative tools accessible to women in poverty, there is of course the human argument. Women make up 70 percent of the world's 1 billion poorest people, work two-thirds of the world's working hours, produce half of the world's food, but earn only 10 percent of the world's income and own less than 1 percent of the world's property. According to the Global Poverty Project, on average, women earn half of what men earn. Such inequalities are highly conspicuous in Gujarat, a state with a wealthy, entrepreneurial population and a government committed to supporting the private sector. To any outsider, Gujarat is part of India's success story – but its rapidly rising share of profits has failed to reduce inequality. A 2011 UNDP Report ranked Gujarat seventh in human development index (HDI) among 19 major states. Yet it is one of India's lowest performers in terms of child malnutrition with 69.7 percent of children up to the age of five anaemic and 44.6 percent malnourished. The simple mobile tool recently adopted by the rudibens of Gujarat is the latest example of placing innovation directly in the hands of rural impoverished women. Social entrepreneur Bunker Roy, the man behind India's Barefoot College, has trained more than three million rural women from around the world to harness the potential of solar energy in recent years. Whether it's a mobile tool to speed up business or the technical skills to install solar panels, the swift and multidimensional change that enters a woman's life when she is equipped with new skills and money cannot be underestimated. In highly patriarchal societies, sudden access to skills and money can alter the dynamics of a woman's relationship with the people around her in unpredictable ways. Most notably, it is the response of male members of the household that can work for or against them. Reema Nanavaty, who manages the RUDI project in Gujarat has witnessed the increase in economic activity for the rudibens. \"In the beginning, some of the husbands resisted the idea of their wives working,\" she said. Dr Kshama Metre, a pioneer of micro-finance in India has worked to empower rural women across the country for thirty years. Her vast experience reflects much of the same. \"An independent woman is a threat to the supremacy of the male ego…when women become independent, they are no more as submissive as before,\" she explains. Dr Metre has observed how even beyond the home, other women in the community can become jealous of an independent earning woman. \"They may pass derogatory comments, suggesting she is neglecting her duties at home. But such challenges are reduced as more women become independent and when such empowered women begin to face these challenges with grit and patience,\" said Dr Metre. In Pushpaben's case, her husband has not only come to accept her economic status, but actively supports her in her business. \"When I have several villages to deliver the orders, he will cover one or two of them,\" she said. Working alongside the rudibens, Nanavaty has also witnessed a reduction in cases of child marriage among the women she works with. \"As soon as they have economic security they learn to value their daughters, and if a law exists, they will collectively work to uphold it,\" she said. Like any good technology, the mobile tool developed for the rudibens is gender agnostic. The potential to scale it up is limitless, according to Nautiyal: \"It's well suited to the agricultural flow of business in any context, because you can manage orders remotely from a very basic mobile phone. \"But while it can be used equally by men and women, it's likely that the benefits of the mobile tool will be felt much more by women, because they face much greater challenges,\" he adds. As pioneering social innovators continue to engage marginalised women with their tools, the journey for others like Pushpaben may lead to greater financial independence. Many will be forced to confront complex social obstacles, but placing such tools in the hands of women has the potential not only to help make India a more prosperous society – but a more equal one too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2013/mar/15/africa-solar-health-cape-town","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-15T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Solar-powered mobile health centre rolls into Cape Town | David Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/mar/15/africa-solar-health-cape-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/mar/15/africa-solar-health-cape-town","fields":{"headline":"Solar-powered mobile health centre rolls into Cape Town","bodyText":"At the back of the truck is a small soundproof booth with a chair, light and pair of headphones.

The seven-metre truck also contains a fully equipped eye and blood clinic and a dental surgery. Its target is the six in 10 people in sub-Saharan Africa who live in rural areas, often lacking the time and money to travel long distances to reach health services. Patients will be screened for conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, tooth decay and cataracts. There will be an emphasis on health education and encouraging tests as a preventative measure. In the next 10 weeks, Samsung plans to add a mother-and-child clinic capable of 4D ultrasound scans and delivering babies. \"Healthcare and education are the key challenges in Africa,\" Modimoeng says. \"The challenges are huge. In Africa our existing healthcare system is overcrowded. We are trying to ease that burden.\" On Wednesday, the truck was parked on Grand Parade, where thousands gathered to hear Nelson Mandela's first speech from the city hall after his release from prison in 1990. It was among innovations promoted by Samsung, the South Korean giant better known for mobile phones and televisions, under the slogan, \"Built for Africa\". The mobile health centre was constructed in Johannesburg, painted in Samsung's corporate blue and white, and included, under an awning, a TV screen. Modimoeng said public information videos would be shown to communities as they queued. Inside, many of the products are made by specialist manufacturers or pharmaceutical companies. At the front is the eye and blood clinic, with a reclining chair for the patient, a sink and mirror, and hi-tech equipment including a blood analyser, spectacle repair kit and \"Reichert PT100 portable NCT\" – a non-contact tonometry test to measure pressure inside the eye. It is likely to have a staff of four. The facility would enable testing for HIV, malaria and numerous other conditions, Modimoeng says. \"You can get blood test results instantly. They can print a prescription for you.\" Next comes the dental clinic, much like any other with its familiar chair and overhead light. It also has an x-ray unit, air motor, mobile suction unit, water distiller and needle incinerator. It will have three staff. At the rear is the ear clinic, expected to have two staff. This is the first of its kind, Modimoeng says, and the ambition is to reach 1 million people in Africa by 2015. \"We are scaling up with Africa in mind. We want to collaborate with governments. The intent is there from various countries.\" But he admitted that solar power alone is still not enough. \"This uses a lot of energy. The solar power charges the lighting, TV and so on. The rest relies on an inbuilt generator using unleaded fuel or a power plug. It's a step in the right direction and, as time unfolds, we are looking at getting equipment that uses less energy.\" But can the health centre withstand Africa's notorious potholed, bone-jarring roads? \"Definitely,\" Modimoeng insists. Also on show at the Samsung forum, where the Guardian was among 200 invited media guests, was a solar-powered internet school – a 12-metre container that can accommodate at least 21 pupils, each with a laptop, and has 24 solar panels providing nine hours of power a day. Fully charged, the batteries last three to five days. Since their launch in 2011, the $100,000 schools have begun operating in Angola, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Lesotho, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa, helping an estimated 7,000 children. Nearby was a solar power generator that can be connected to conventional classrooms. Samsung says that, on average, less than 25% of rural areas in Africa have access to electricity. Leonard Tleane, smart schools solutions provider for the company, says solar energy is a growing part of the solution. \"The costs are definitely coming down and most of corporate South Africa is moving into solar power. You walk into the townships these days and almost every house has a solar geyser.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/green-living-blog/2011/nov/17/solar-energy-electricity-grid-parity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-17T16:17:31Z","webTitle":"How long do we have to wait before solar technology reaches 'grid parity'? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/nov/17/solar-energy-electricity-grid-parity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/nov/17/solar-energy-electricity-grid-parity","fields":{"headline":"How long do we have to wait before solar technology reaches 'grid parity'?","bodyText":"With Solyndra failing and solar technology being highly subsidised, how long to go before we achieve grid parity? Karan Mangotra, via Twitter There is little point denying that the renewable energy industry faces an uphill challenge in persuading both governments and consumers that it should be favoured over the fossil fuel industry when it comes to generating electricity. The economic maelstrom that rages around us all at the moment means that everyone is concentrating on the bottom line. Nowhere is this focus more acute than with the cost of energy. It takes a brave politician - of which we seem to have very few - to stand up for any fledgling industry needing financial support in the way of subsidies. And the solar energy industry is a sector which is currently seeing any support it has received in the past fast withering. For example, the recent announcement by the government that it intends to slash the feed-in tariff aimed at kick-starting the solar industry in the UK has caused much consternation across the renewables sector. And, in the US, the media and political spotlight is currently focused on the bankrupt solar panel maker Solyndra and the details of the $535m loan guarantee it received from the US Department of Energy. The solar industry would have a much easier ride, of course, if it could proclaim \"grid parity\": the moment when the electricity it produces costs the same as the electricity generated by fossil fuels. Just when this magical moment is due to arrive is, quite naturally, the subject of much speculation. And any calculations are made much harder when governments send out mixed messages to the industry. Last year, these pages hosted a hotly contested debate between George Monbiot and Solarcentury's Jeremy Leggett. In the course of the debate, Leggett accepted Monbiot's £100 bet that Leggett's prediction that solar photovoltaic electricity in homes will be no more pricey in 2013 than \"conventional\" electricity will turn out to be wrong. One year on, has there been any progress in the pursuit of grid parity for solar energy? One recent calculation, for example, predicted 2018 was a more likely date for grid parity in developing nations blessed with strong solar radiation, but not feed-in tariffs. Are the prices of panels falling? And, if so, will they continue to do so? Or has the pressure on subsidies pushed the arrival of grid parity further back?

Source of much of the world's cocoa and an increasingly significant oil producer, Ghana's new drive to exploit the sun's energy is predicted to create hundreds of jobs and increase the country's electricity capacity by 6%, as well as cutting emissions. Blue Energy, the renewable energy developer behind the $400m project, which has built a solar farm 31 times smaller outside Swindon, said the 155MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant will be fully operational by October 2015. Construction on the Nzema project is due to begin near the village of Aiwiaso in western Ghana by the end of 2013, with the installation of some 630,000 PV modules. The power plant, which at the time of planning would be the fourth biggest of its kind in the world, will be the first major scheme to claim payments from Ghana's feed-in tariff incentive scheme, created by the government in 2011. Ghana has a target of increasing renewable energy capacity from its current 1% of the country's energy mix to 10% by 2020. Chris Dean, chief executive of Blue Energy, said: \"Ghana's forward-thinking strategy puts it in a strong position to lead the renewable energy revolution in sub-Saharan Africa. Nzema is a case study in how governments can unlock the huge potential for solar energy in Africa. We are delighted that it will make a strong contribution to the national economy, provide much needed generating capacity and help develop the skills of the future.\" Douglas Coleman, the project's director at Blue Energy, told the Guardian that the company was using solar PV instead of the distinctive 'troughs' used in concentrated solar power technology seen in north Africa and the Middle East in part because PV only requires light, not direct sunlight. The choice of PV means the farm will still generate electricity during the more than 100 cloudy days Ghana experiences each year, he said. The company said it expects to create 200 permanent jobs and 500 during the construction phase, which already has the go-ahead from planning authorities. The plan for the Ghanian plant follows recent denials of a crisis at the separate Desertec initiative – which envisions solar plants in north Africa providing green energy for Europe – following the withdrawal of Siemens and Bosch from the initiative. Ghana recorded the fastest growth in Sub-Saharan Africa last year, with GDP growing at 14.3%, driven by oil production. In March, London-based Tullow Oil said an oil field it had found off the coast in 2011 was a major find. The average carbon footprint of a Ghanian is 0.4 tonnes of CO2, compared to 8.5 tonnes of CO2 per head in the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/clean-energy-climate-change-christiana-figueres","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-04T12:10:00Z","webTitle":"Why we need innovative finance models to tackle climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/clean-energy-climate-change-christiana-figueres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/clean-energy-climate-change-christiana-figueres","fields":{"headline":"Why we need innovative finance models to tackle climate change","bodyText":"Finance is at the heart of the response to climate change. For the world to stay below the internationally agreed 2C temperature rise, we need a further dramatic capital shift towards a low-carbon economy. This will only be possible if financial resources flow into low carbon technologies, renewable energy and energy efficiency faster and at a significantly larger scale. The good news is that the global attitude towards clean energy investment and the need to adapt to climate change has already shifted. Many businesses, including some of the largest institutional investors, increasingly recognise the risks of climate change and the opportunities of low-carbon investments. This was most recently highlighted in a 2013 report by the World Economic Forum. In 2011, renewable energy investment topped $1tn globally, before slightly dipping due to some climate policy uncertainty in major markets. But clean energy technology investments are now recovering, primarily because of continuously falling prices of renewable energy. In countries such as Australia and Brazil, newly installed wind energy is already cheaper than conventional energy sources. And newly installed utility-scale solar energy has globally doubled within the space of just one year. The not-so-good news is that even at record levels, the scale of clean energy investment is not enough to keep climate change within reasonably safe boundaries. Moreover, subsidies for fossil fuels, which already amount to around half a trillion dollars a year annually, continue to rise despite pledges of the G20 to reduce these inefficient incentives that are clearly harmful to both national economies and the global climate. Given that it would require at least an additional $36tn of investment in clean energy by 2050 for the world to stay below a maximum 2C temperature rise, present investment is clearly inadequate. In order to unleash significantly more investment into low-carbon technologies, we need to make full use of the synergies possible between three central pillars of climate action – at international, national and private-sector level. The international community is presently working towards a 2015 universal climate agreement that includes all countries and seeks to raise ambition to curb greenhouse gases before 2020, when the new agreement is to come into force. For the new agreement to be fully effective, national legislation – the second pillar of action – will also need to be strengthened. Thankfully, a growing number of countries are passing progressive climate legislation that sends the right signals to business and investors, including a price on carbon. The third pillar of action is the response from the private sector, which holds the balance of global capital and innovative capacity and can create further political space to act by investing in the right technologies. Business action can encourage individual governments and the international community as a whole to be more ambitious. To spur further and faster movement, all stakeholders need more confidence that action on climate change is indeed economically and politically feasible. Many initiatives between governments and business are presently under-reported and deserve to be highlighted. Just one example of what is possible, which has already been recognised by the UNFCCC secretariat's Momentum for Change initiative, is India's solar mission. The mission makes use of the Partial Credit Guarantee scheme of the Asian Development Bank to bridge the gap between the needs of borrowers and the constraints of the commercial lenders, covering 50% of the payment default risk on bank loans made to solar project developers. The model is based on a financing scheme that strategically uses public funds to de-risk and leverage much greater amounts of private investment. This is just one example of what can be done, and I look forward to many more examples being submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat by pioneers and visionaries of innovative finance. Innovation has historically been at the heart of the greatest business and financial successes, and creative innovation must now turn to the climate challenge, arguably the greatest economic challenge of our time. To meet this challenge, we need to unleash political energy and increase funding across all three pillars of response. The public sector and business must collaborate and innovate creatively to keep the world within safe climate boundaries. Christiana Figueres is executive secretary at the UNFCCC.

Rosetta, the unmanned spacecraft that dropped the lander, will help triangulate Philae’s location with a special sensor system. The lander bounced twice upon landing and is not exactly parallel to the surface, with one leg seemingly stretching out into open space, possibly over the rim of a crater. Some experiments have begun, but scientists are wary of using instruments such as drills to collect samples, in case the movement launches the lander back into the air, tips it over or spins it off kilter. In the shadow of a rocky outcropping, Esa will attempt to adjust Philae’s solar panels to get as much sunlight as possible, having so far generated just 90 minutes of power out of a hoped for 6-7 hours. Philae’s battery is predicted to run out some time on Saturday. Esa has received the first photos from the surface of a comet, as well as data from Philae and Rosetta, which has come through intermittently and at a relatively slow rate. Some of Philae’s experiments began shortly after landing, and Esa confirmed today that they’ve activated MUPUS (multi-purpose sensors for surface and subsurface science), a set of devices that will measure the density, thermal and mechanical qualities of the comet’s surface. They’ve also activated CONSERT (comet nucleus sounding experiment by radiowave transmission), a sophisticated probe that sees right through the comet by way of radio waves. CONSERT links up with Rosetta, and is also being used to help triangulate Philae’s position, which we still don’t know with much precision. One of the most important experiments, Ptolemy (after the ancient astronomer who also pioneered ideas about optics), may have to wait until batteries are almost dead, because it requires Philae to use its drill – which could shift the whole lander from its uncertain position. Ptolemy is “an evolved gas analyzer”, and could help determine just what’s on comets and whether they could have seeded the Earth with organic compounds often called the “building blocks of life”. Systems engineer Bobak Ferdowsi, he of the Nasa Mars mission mohawk, gives some perspective to yesterday’s accomplishment. If you’re coming only recently to the Rosetta mission and want a quick recap on how Philae’s landing went, the lander’s challenges and the answers Esa is looking for on a ball of ice, rock and gas hurtling around the sun, take a look at a piece filed earlier today. As Dr Geraint Morgan explained to Open University, “we will sniff the comet no matter what happens” – meaning that the probe will still examine molecules drifting up from the surface. Many of the experiments are preprogrammed, and the Philae mission could help determine whether comets brought water to Earth, and whether they seeded our planet with chemical compounds (“organics”) that are the building blocks of life. Comets are ancient remnants of the solar system’s earliest moments, and 60 hours of data could provide a glimpse into what happened as the planets formed (or before they formed). You can read the full piece here. This Esa tweet from earlier in the day shows the site of the original landing (the purple) compared with the range where Philae is expected to be now (the blue diamond). Nasa imaging specialist Doug Ellison takes a stab at visualizing how Philae stands on the comet. We interrupt this record of a historic achievement in science with news theories of conspiracy surrounding the Philae landing, as compiled by my colleague Hannah Ellis-Petersen. “Comet 67P is NOT a comet,” the UFO site letter continues. “Some 20 years ago Nasa began detecting radio bursts from an unknown origin out in space. It would later be known that these had likely come from the direction of the now named comet 67P. It does show signs on its outside of machine like parts and unnatural terrain.” ESA’s confirmation that the comet had been emitting a “mystery song” has fuelled theories that it is in fact an alien ship and the warbling is an extra-terrestrial attempt at communication. That “song” actually comprises oscillations in the magnetic field around the comet, audible to our ears only because Esa sped up the data 10,000 times its rate. You can read more from the creative minds of amateur investigators here, and learn more about the whistling here. Earlier today Dr Bibring was asked about the surface of the comet and whether Esa can tell what sort of material makes up the area where Philae landed and now perches precariously. The reporter asks whether the surface is low density fluffy stuff, as Esa sugested earlier. Bibring reminds him that we don’t know much at all about the comet yet: “[The area near Philae] has some resonance in our head that it’s a cliff, but we don’t think it’s that sort of cliff because the material is very low density anywhere. The density is less than 0.5 … So the idea of having a very porous material at the top came from that [and from] from the very first images [of the comet] … We’re not saying that that’s not still the case, that might still be the case. We have not demonstrated that we don’t have a crust, we have not demonstrated that we have a crust. “Are you satisfied? I’m very happy if you’re not satisfied.” His colleague explains a bit more: “The rebound of the lander is an indication of a higher strength material, and that was a surprise to us. … So we have seen a variety of surfaces, a snow field of soft stuff, and this rocky field of rock stuff, which could be a [stronger material], and we also see this shiny stuff,” which he says could also be a stronger material. How do you find the first photos from the surface of a comet? The Guardian’s Roger Tooth isn’t all that impressed. Of course this is a miracle: a huge rock in space, 300m miles away, moving at 40,000mph, and here’s our little craft snapping away as it bounces down on to it. It’s a miracle, but the pictures when they come through are a disappointment photographically. They’re in black and white and there’s some sort of landing leg in the way. The images have a pioneering magic, but not the beauty of the 1968 Earthrise image taken by a moon-orbiting Apollo 8 or the 1972 beauty that became known as the Blue Marble picture of Earth. You can read more about Roger’s thoughts and judge the photos for yourself here. With Philae “permanently in the shadow of a cliff”, according to Dr Bibring, Esa has to consider whether an attempt to nudge or secure the lander is worth the risk of toppling it. Bibring said Philae is probably “a couple of meters” from the cliff face, and lander manager Stephan Ulamec said the lander’s orientation was “bizarre, or not so obvious”, and would require very careful adjustment, if any. My colleagues Ian Sample and Stuart Clark have more on the decisions Esa must mull: The spacecraft was designed with landing gear that could hop the probe around, but from its awkward position on its side the option is considered too risky. But the team has decided to operate another moving instrument, named Mupus, on Thursday evening. This could cause Philae to shift, but calculations show that it would be in a direction that could improve the amount of sunlight falling on the probe. A change in angle of only a few degrees could help. A new panoramic image will be taken after the Mupus deployment to see if there has been any movement. Esa will also try to move the solar panels to maximize sunlight; you can read the full piece on Philae’s challenges here. An image taken from 50km, about a week before landing, showing the spot Philae touched down – “we couldn’t have had better luck. It’s flat, flat like hell, which is great.” That’s a project manager during today’s earlier Esa briefing, he’s happy but a bit rueful: “We wished it would’ve stayed there, but it didn’t.” Lead lander scientist Dr Jean-Pierre Bibring earlier today said that one of Philae’s legs is sticking out into space, possibly over a crater or ditch. “We’re almost vertical, one foot probably in the open space … two feet still on the surface, but you can imagine the gentle maneuver that we’re supposed to do now to maintain” Philae’s position, he said. One of his colleague’s added that Philae isn’t “standing, let’s say, parallel to the surface, so we need to modify the plans … to cope”. As Stuart and James noted earlier, even the rotation of a drill could dramatically change how Philae stands on the surface. The UK office is now handing over the reins of this blog to our colleague in the US, Alan Yuhas, who will keep bringing you the latest news from this extraordinary story of space exploration. The European Space Agency still does not know the exact location of the Philae lander on the comet, but it has narrowed the area down considerably. The lander is sending back data, albeit intermittently and at a relatively slow rate. Scientists have worked out the probable orientation of the lander in the tight spot in which it finds itself. They are wary of using instruments such as drills to collect samples, in case the movement launches the lander back into the air or tips it over. Time is running out to collect scientific data, however, because poor illumination at the landing site means the lander isn’t charging its batteries adequately. So far it has only generated enough power for just 90 minutes out of a hoped for 6-7 hours. Its initial battery power is predicted to run out some time on Saturday. Here’s a Guardian interactive graphic illustrating Philae’s predicament. Using the panoramic image series just posted on this blog, the Philae lander team have superimposed a sketch showing their best guess for the orientation of the craft relative to its surroundings. Esa has just released this panoramic image series of the wall of rock in front of Philae, captured by its ÇIVA-P imaging system. Six identical micro-cameras are designed to take pictures of the surface. A spectrometer then studies the surface’s composition, texture and albedo (reflectivity). Dr Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, thinks this mission tells us something about scientists as well as science: Philae has been on the comet for just one day, but the sense of tension and awe it has created has been remarkable. It is a huge relief to hear that Philae is still functioning and gathering data and images. The amount of emotion we have seen from the team since the landing shows that science does not come from the head alone, but from the heart and soul too. Space and planetary exploration is touching the very core of what we are about, challenging the impossible and shedding light on the unknown. One look at the images sent back from Rosetta and Philae confirm this. The predictability of Newton’s laws has emboldened the scientists to deploy part of the MUPUS instrument tonight. This could cause Philae to shift, but calculations show that it would be in a direction that could improve the illumination. Even a few degrees more illumination could help recharge the lander’s batteries. To date, Philae has generated enough power for just 90 minutes out of a hoped for 6-7 hours. A new panoramic image will be taken after the MUPUS deployment to see if there has been any movement. In parallel, there is a big effort from the Rosetta orbiter team to try to pinpoint Philae’s position. This will be done with images from the Osiris camera and with the CONSERT radar instrument. CONSERT communicates with Philae. It is designed to beam radar through the interior of the comet to reveal its internal structure. When Rosetta is directly overhead, CONSERT can provide highly accurate triangulation. “When we see where we are, we can decide what to do next,” says Jean-Pierre Bibring, lead scientist for the lander. But time is tight, the first 24 hours of the battery life will soon be gone. It is expected to be completely drained sometime on Saturday. “We are running against the clock,” admits Bibring, “Don’t put the emphasis on failure, it is gorgeous where we are.” Engineers at Esa have calculated that the touchdown velocity was 1 m/s, slower than expected. Without the harpoons as anchors, Philae rebounded with a velocity of 38cm/s and conducted a leisurely jump for two hours. In that time, it is now thought that Philae reached a altitude of about 1km and drifted about 1km away from the original site. On a comet of just 4km in length, that is quite significant. The second jump was just for a few minutes and resulted in the lander coming to rest somewhere in the original landing site candidate known as site B. Philae is thought to be resting somewhere in candidate landing site B, shown here. The exact location of the lander is unknown but it is probably toward the bottom right of the image. Originally this landing site was rejected by Esa on account of the large boulders and the poorer illumination than site J, which was chosen and became known as Agilkia. Philae has been designed to achieve its main science objectives within its initial 60-hour battery life. When asked at the press conference what was the absolutely fundamental investigation to be performed, Jean-Pierre Bibring – lead scientist for the lander – said it was to analyse the organic molecules on the comet. To do that, it must get samples into its PTOLEMY, COSAC and CIVA instruments. There are two ways to do this: by sniffing and drilling. Sniffing involves opening the instruments and allowing molecules from the comet’s surface to drift in. The instruments are already acquiring samples like this and returning data. Drilling is much riskier because it could topple the lander. Newton’s third law of motion says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the minuscule gravity of the comet, any movement by Philae’s tools could cause the whole lander to shift or even take off again. The drill turning one way will make Philae want to turn the other. Pushing down into the surface will push the lander in the opposite direction. “We don’t want to start drilling and end the mission,” says Bibring. So they will try this only towards the end of the 60-hour nominal mission. Here’s a reminder of Philae’s rather restricted view, at the foot of what appears to be a cliff, or the bottom of a very deep hole. In this new image released by Esa, the circled speck is the Philae lander during its descent. The picture was taken by Rosetta’s OSIRIS wide-angle camera at 14:19:22 GMT on Wednesday. This image was taken by the ROLIS camera on Philae when it was 40 metres above the surface. It suggests a very loose, dusty surface. The red cross-hairs mark where Philae first hit the ground before bouncing. This image was taken by the OSIRIS instrument on Rosetta from a distance of 30 kilometres back in September. It is thought that Philae bounced twice before settling on the surface. It may have come to rest at the foot of the cliff surrounding the depression, in the lower right corner of the image. Jean-Pierre Bibring, however, points out that drilling to take samples for isotopic analysis is critical to the whole scientific purpose of the mission. With time running out, he hopes that this might be given the green light as soon as tomorrow. Stephan Ulamec explains that activating any moving parts will be high risk, tipping the lander or pushing it away from the surface completely: “Drilling without being anchored is dangerous.” The same applies to any attempt to fire the harpoons. The landing gear was designed to “hop” to relocate the craft, but without knowing whether the feet are in contact with the surface this is not currently a viable option to move it to a more suitable position - away from the cliff face. But there’s clearly a variety of surfaces on the comet, rocky and dusty, which may explain the bounces. Chances are the comet is made of a very low-density material, without a hard crust. Early images of the ground were overexposed, making it impossible to spot the lander, but subsequent images waiting to be downloaded from Rosetta will be more accurately exposed. Timelapse of pictures from Rosetta reveals Philae rotating as it came down. One of the images is so clear you can see the lander’s solar panels. These are the first images before processing. That was Stefano Mottola from the Lander Control Centre in Cologne, Germany, describing the nature of the material revealed on the surface of the comet and how it may have got there. “The images provide a wealth of data that will keep us busy for some time to come.” “The lander is relying on solar energy ... we’re getting one and half hours of sunlight when we expected six or seven. This has an impact on our energy budget.” The lander was spinning as it came down. When it stopped they knew it had finally come to rest. The first landing was on target, followed by a huge jump. The likely current location area of the lander suggests it may be facing the rim of a crater. CONSERT is a radar instrument on Rosetta designed to probe the interior of the comet. It is being used to triangulate the exact position of Philae. This is Stephan Ulamec speaking. He’s Philae lander manager at the DLR German space centre. They’re going to try to “modify the orientation” to get more light on the solar panels. “Astonishing” image from camera 4. The view is of rock not a powdery surface as was expected. This is Jean-Pierre Bibring of the Institut d’Astrophysique Spatiale in Paris, who has spent almost two decades working on the Rosetta mission. He is the principal investigator responsible for the CIVA camera that has been taking selfies of Rosetta and the comet. Four new images about to be revealed. Two other images were merged to give us the image they released to the world earlier today. “Yesterday was great but today will be even bigger.” These are yesterday’s highlights playing on the livestream now. Today’s update has yet to start. You have to wonder how clear heads will be after yesterday’s excitement and the celebrations that must surely have followed. The press conference is about to start. Watch it on the livestream at the top of this page. Apparently the lander did receive some power from its solar panels, but it appears that parts of the craft were in shadow while last night’s surface telemetry was being transmitted. Teams are still working to confirm the lander’s location and the overall power and thermal situation on board. Nonetheless, it appears to be performing well. The ESA Rosetta blog is reporting: The lander did receive some power from the solar panels on Wall No. 2, but it appears that parts of the lander were in shadow during the time that last night’s surface telemetry were being transmitted. This could be worrying. Solar power is essential if Philae is to survive longer than the original 60 hours battery life. “Philae is on the surface and doing a marvellous job, working very well and we can say we have a very happy lander,” says Paolo Ferri, Esa’s head of mission operations at ESOC. Flight director Andrea Accomazzo adds that during the second lander-orbiter communication slot, which ran from 06:01 GMT until 09:58GMT this morning, “We had a perfect pass; the radio link was extremely stable and we could download everything according to the nominal plan.” Here’s the livestream from mission control in Darmstadt. A key observation for helping determine the exact landing spot will be the day and night cycle of the comet. The Agilkia landing site was chosen because of its good illumination but the comet’s rotation means that it will sometimes be in darkness. Timing exactly when this happens using data from the solar panels or other instruments will provide a valuable piece in the puzzle when tracking down the final landing spot. A French Space Agency (CNES) official has just said that he thinks of the Philae landing as being like a baby goat bouncing up and down! That might be a loose translation – he was speaking in French. The hunt for Philae continues. It is not yet know exactly where Philae is located on the comet but the thinking is that the lander is not too far away from its original target point. The lander bounced twice yesterday, finally coming to rest two hours after the original touchdown. Contact was re-established with Philae this morning around 6:00 GMT, just two minutes after the window opened. Fred Jansen, Rosetta mission manager, told me, “Yesterday there were people who said that if the lander jumped up and was hovering for an hour or two, the comet would rotate underneath it and then you could be anywhere. But to see the signal so close to the planned time means that we must be close to our original landing spot.” The good news from mission control is that scientific data is flowing in, even though the communications link between Philae and Rosetta remains intermittent. “We have telemetry and massive data already. This is a success,” says mission manager Fred Jansen. We still don’t know the exact location of Philae. Ingenious Esa engineers are planning to use the radar instrument CONSERT to triangulate its position. The instrument on Rosetta is designed to probe the comet’s subsurface using radio waves, which are pinged back to the orbiter by a transponder in the Philae lander. During the descent, CONSERT showed that the lander was just 50 metres adrift from the targeted landing spot. Esa had planned for the error in position being up to 500 metres. Of course, that was before those two slow-motion bounces. Magnetic field data from Philae’s ROMAT instrument revealed three “landings”. The first was almost exactly on the expected arrival time of 15:33 GMT. But as we now know the anchoring harpoons did not fire and Philae rebounded. In the weak gravity of the comet it took about two hours for the lander to return to the surface after that first bounce. It touched down for a second time at 17:26 GMT, then bounced again before finally coming to rest at 17:33. We’ve been promised four more pictures from the press conference at 1pm GMT forming the first 360° panorama of the surface. Worryingly, an Esa official has let slip that there “may” not be a horizon visible in those either. If Philae is wedged in a hole, this could be a serious problem because its initial battery life is only 60 hours. Thereafter it must rely on solar power. “We are definitely not in the open,” says mission manager Fred Jansen. Discussions are taking place about whether to deploy the lander’s drills and other moveable parts to nudge it into a better position. The image released this morning comprises two CIVA images from the full panorama of six images that will be released at 1pm. These will show the other two legs of the lander, and provide a full panorama of the landing site. CIVA itself comprises six micro cameras dotted around Philae’s body. There will be a press conference in Darmstadt at 1pm GMT revealing what the scientists have gleaned from the data coming back from Philae. We’ll livestream that and report the highlights here. The suspicion is that the lander is in a crater or facing a cliff. A mosaic of two images taken by the lander’s CIVA camera shows one of Philae’s legs and the craggy surface. Esa had been expecting a view of the horizon … “We’re either looking into a ditch or we are against a wall,” project scientist Matt Taylor has told our astronomy blogger Stuart Clark. Here’s video from the press conference on Wednesday evening including Stephan Ulamec, the Philae project manager explaining their initial thoughts about what happened during the bouncy touch down. Here’s an update from Esa’s main control room. They say that contact with the lander was re-established at 6:01 GMT and then lost again at 9:58 GMT. This due to the Rosetta mothership dipping below the comet’s horizon. In that time the scientists were able to receive science data from the surface. The team are planning a rocket burn by Rosetta on Friday to keep it in position. Rosetta is operating nominally; the network systems and overall ground segment to control the mission are nominal Last night, Rosetta lost contact with Philae as expected when it orbited below the horizon just after 20:00 CET. Contact was re-established this morning at 06:01 UTC / 07:01 CET, and the Philae-Rosetta radio link was initially unstable. As Rosetta rose higher above the Philae landing site, the link became very stable and the lander could transmit telemetry (status and housekeeping information) and science data from the surface. This morning’s surface link was again lost due to Rosetta’s orbit at about 09:58 UTC / 10:58 CET. Ignacio [Tanco, deputy spacecraft operations manager] explains that with the current orbit, Rosetta will have, typically, two Philae communication windows per day. The next window opens at 19:27 UTC on the spacecraft and runs through to 23:47 UTC spacecraft time. Esa has released a video of highlights from last night’s press conference providing detail about the touchdown. Esa reports that mission control is optimising Rosetta’s orbit for communication with the Philae lander. Rosetta conducted a thruster burn last night and plans are being made today to carry out another burn on Friday to keep the spacecraft in the best position. Rosetta is sending signals to ground stations at about 28 kilobits per second. Ignacio Tanco, deputy spacecraft operations manager, says about 1 or 2 kilobits of this is used for the spacecraft’s own telemetry report, with the rest being used to download science data from Rosetta and science and telemetry data from Philae. It is magnetic field data from Philae’s ROMAP instrument that revealed the three “landings”. The first was almost exactly on the expected arrival time of 15:33 GMT. Philae then rebounded by hundreds of metres. In the weak gravity of the comet this bounce took about two hours. It touched the surface again at 17:26 GMT and bounced again before coming to rest at 17:33 GMT. Lander project manager Stephan Ulamec has told the BBC’s Jonathan Amos: We are still not anchored. We are sitting with the weight of the lander somehow on the comet. We are pretty sure where we landed the first time, and then we made quite a leap. Some people say it is in the order of one kilometre high. And then we had another small leap, and now we are sitting there, and transmitting, and everything else is something we have to start understanding and keep interpreting. Dr Matt Taylor, project scientist on the Rosetta mission, describes the bumpy landing (including one nearly two-hour bounce) as “three landings for the price of one”. The descent was due on to a particular point on the surface of the comet; the bounce would have made it go up and then the comet’s rotating underneath. So we know, if we are looking at an image, that most likely the lander is somewhere on the right and now we are trying to refine that to really start focusing on the orbiter images to see where it is. In the next few hours we hope to be piecing the data we get on the lander to add this all together. We know it’s stable and sitting in place - that’s about as stable as we could wish for at the moment - and the next few hours should give us a bit more illumination on what the situation is there. It seems that even David Cameron was watching while on his way to the G20 summit in Brisbane. And here’s Philae’s take on the events of yesterday. The first bounce took nearly two hours! This was a result of gravity on the comet being so weak. That image was taken by CIVA (the Comet Infrared and Visible Analyser) which is described by the scientists at the Open University in the UK thus: The first experiment, CIVA-P, consists of seven identical cameras that will produce a panoramic image of the comet as seen from Philae. CIVA-P will characterise the landing site, mapping the surface topography and the albedo (reflectivity) of the surface. Two of the camera are aligned so as to produce stereoscopic images. Esa has released the first image from the surface of the comet taken by the Philae lander. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of day two of the European Space Agency’s epic mission to land the first human-created object on a comet. Esa scientists have now re-established contact with the Philae lander and are describing it as “stable”. After yesterday’s euphoria that the lander had touched down safely there was confusion. It emerged that harpoons that should have fired to hold it in place on the surface had not deployed. Communications from Philae were intermittent and it later transpired that it had bounced twice after hitting the surface – so Esa actually landed three times on a comet. The landing was hailed as an amazing achievement after a 10-year, six-billion-kilometre voyage through space, but there were concerns that the bumpy landing might have limited what the scientists could get back from the mission. So it is a relief this morning that Philae is sending information back to Earth again via its mothership Rosetta. Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor (he of the crazy shirt) said on Thursday morning they were receiving a good signal and receiving science data. “Now we are busy analysing what it all means and really trying to find out where the lander actually is on the surface.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/oct/22/siemens-pulls-out-loss-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-22T16:22:07Z","webTitle":"Siemens pulls out of loss-making solar power business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/22/siemens-pulls-out-loss-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/oct/22/siemens-pulls-out-loss-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Siemens pulls out of loss-making solar power business","bodyText":"German industrial group Siemens is pulling out of its loss-making solar power business, in the latest sign of difficulties in the renewable energy market. The company said on Monday it would concentrate its renewable energy business on wind and hydroelectric power in a bid to increase productivity. It hopes to sell the unit and is in talks with possible buyers. Siemens said the solar business had not been as profitable as hoped. \"Due to the changed framework conditions, lower growth and strong price pressure in the solar markets, the company's expectations for its solar energy activities have not been met.\" It said the solar and hydro division generated sales \"in the low triple-digit millions\" in the year to September and has \"roughly 800 employees\". Growing competition from manufacturers in Asia has caused the cost of solar panels to plummet. The industry has also been hit by weaker sales and falling government subsidies. Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, managing director at Impax, an environmental investor with £1.8bn of assets under management, said: \"The cost has come down dramatically. There has been an influx of capital. It's very, very competitive; it's only going to be the lowest-cost producers that survive in the middle of this downturn.\" Various German solar manufacturers have filed for bankruptcy in the past 12 months, including QE Cells and Solar Millennium. The news comes shortly after General Electric said a poor performance at its wind unit contributed to disappointing third-quarter results. Wind-turbine orders at the industrial conglomerate plunged because a key US subsidy for wind power is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. The chief executive, Jeff Immelt, said GE is assuming \"no market\" in the US for wind turbines next year without the subsidy. He expects wind revenue to drop 40% next year. Jenkyn-Jones said: \"There's definitely a cyclical element to some of this. In the long term, renewables still look interesting.\" He said policy changes with regards to renewables posed a major challenge to investors in the industry. \"The most important issue for governments is to provide stable frameworks for investors to make sensible decisions.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/19/solar-subsidy-cuts-government-compromise","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-19T17:46:14Z","webTitle":"Solar subsidy cuts: government offers compromise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/19/solar-subsidy-cuts-government-compromise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/19/solar-subsidy-cuts-government-compromise","fields":{"headline":"Solar subsidy cuts: government offers compromise","bodyText":"About 3,700 homes and businesses could claim a higher rate of subsidies for solar panels after the government on Thursday offered a compromise deal in the row over cuts to the scheme. Although there is a continuing legal battle over the announcement last year that the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc) would cut solar feed-in tariff payments by half from 12 December, ministers said that if they lose the legal case they will fund the higher rate payments for any panels installed by 3 March. A high court judge ruled in December that the cuts were \"legally flawed\", following a challenge by solar companies and green groups, which feared that the sudden decision would cause a plunge in demand and severely damage the industry. After a massive rush to fit solar panels following the government's announcement – with about 80,000 installations in the six weeks to the original December 12 deadline – demand has plummeted, with DECC expecting only 3,700 more from that date until March 3. If the government loses its court appeal, millions of pounds will be added to the feed-in tariff's budget, which is already running over for this financial year. Climate minister Greg Barker told the House of Commons, however, that if the government wins the legal challenge, it would stop paying higher subsidies for anything installed after 12 December last year. In a repetition of his earlier arguments for cutting the subsidy, Barker added: \"It is very important that we reserve this as an option because these 43p [higher rate] payments will take a disproportionate share of the budget available for small-scale low-carbon technologies. We want instead to maximise the number of installations that are possible within the available budget rather than use available subsidy to pay a higher tariff to a smaller number of installations.\" The latest announcement that the government would fund the higher tariffs for installations up until 3 March if it loses the case was welcomed by groups which were angered by the October decision. The Renewable Energy Association said the \"plan B\" offered more certainty to consumers and businesses who made and installed the equipment. Andy Atkins, the executive director of Friends of the Earth – one of the three parties to take legal action against the government over the cuts – said: \"At last the government is taking steps to sort out some of the uncertainty that's crippling a thriving UK industry – planned cuts will at last allow solar firms to start planning for the future. Solar payments should be cut in line with falling costs – but by trying to rush through payment before the consultation closed ministers created a shambolic mess that threatens 30,000 jobs and the future of the industry.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"local-government-network/2013/jan/17/decentralised-energy-answer-to-rising-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-17T13:45:00Z","webTitle":"Why councils could be the answer to the energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/jan/17/decentralised-energy-answer-to-rising-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/local-government-network/2013/jan/17/decentralised-energy-answer-to-rising-prices","fields":{"headline":"Why councils could be the answer to the energy crisis","bodyText":"How we generate and consume energy is now perhaps the most significant threat to economic and social wellbeing. Already high energy prices are predicted to keep rising and our current use of fossil fuels is unsustainable. Politicians are in deadlock over the future of the country's energy infrastructure. This is a bleak and familiar picture, but local authorities across the UK are beginning to see an alternative. They are taking control of their own energy future and investing in decentralised networks that bring down prices, improve energy security, cut carbon and make communities more prosperous and resilient. Decentralised energy is not yet a widely understood term, but broadly refers to energy that is generated off the main grid, including micro-renewables, heating and cooling. It can refer to energy from waste plants, combined heat and power, district heating and cooling, as well as geothermal, biomass or solar energy. Schemes can serve a single building or a whole community, even being built out across entire cities. The drivers behind this new energy revolution are clear. Energy insecurity carries a massive social and economic cost. The 2003 US-Canada blackout affected around 50 million people, and had an estimated economic cost of approximately $6.4bn. The consequences of climate change, whilst they will affect us all, will largely be dealt with by the public sector – whether that's the NHS, emergency services or local authorities. The public sector, and therefore the taxpayer, will also have to pick up the bill and clean up the mess. Then there's fuel poverty. This is having a huge social impact in the UK, with 4.75 million households in fuel poverty in 2010, representing a staggering 19% of the total. District heating in Aberdeen has cut energy bills by around 50%, giving residents access to lower cost and lower carbon heat. It could do the same elsewhere. One of the challenges of deploying decentralised energy at scale in the UK is unlocking private investment, and the relationship between the public sector and private investors needs to be right. These are viable, often commercially attractive projects that not only create revenue but pay back in a relatively short time. The public sector is the key to unlocking development – both as a potential leader and beneficiary. At the Carbon Trust we're working with Bristol city council to help them lead and manage their own projects and ensure that maximum public benefit is achieved. Bristol has secured £2.5m to develop sustainable energy projects in the city, including four district heating schemes. So why aren't more decentralised energy projects happening in the UK? The barriers aren't primarily technical. While the market in the UK is not huge, the expertise is available. The major obstacle to mass take-up is the lack of experience and expertise in the public sector. Organisations do not yet understand the role that they can play in developing and implementing these projects. But whilst there is a lack of experience, there is no lack of vision and enthusiasm to grasp the possibilities. The scale of the challenge is huge, but so is the opportunity. Public bodies all around the country are looking into what decentralised energy can do for them. If every local authority in the UK with a potentially viable scheme found a way to bring that project to market then we would trounce all current targets and predictions. There's clearly much to be done. Fortunately, in the words of Al Gore, \"political will is a renewable resource\". Helen Andrews Tipper is public sector energy programmes manager at the Carbon Trust.

But today the largest mobile network in the US – with 144 million customers for its broadband, TV and wireless data services – has more in common with the tech giants of our age than the clunky rotary dial telephones, switches and copper wires that dominated telecommunications only a few decades ago. Supply chain sustainability Verizon's sustainability journey began in 2009. Chief sustainability officer and vice-president of supply chain operations James Gowen had already been working on energy efficiency improvements in the company's supply chain, with responsibility for $2.5bn in procurement. \"I did all the purchasing, I was responsible for transportation and I paid the electricity bill,\" said Gowen. \"I had the biggest opportunity to make a change. I was not an environmentalist by trade, but in the last three and a half years, I have gained a tremendous respect for sustainability and I've seen a transformation in myself.\" That year, Verizon established the industry's first energy standards for its supply chain that required new equipment be at least 20% more energy efficient than the equipment it replaced. Gowen said this was \"low hanging fruit\" but the impact on the industry was far-reaching as other telecom companies began using the new, more energy-efficient components. Last year, Verizon went further by establishing a new supply chain goal to devote 40% of supplier spending by 2015 to firms that measure and set targets to reduce carbon emissions. \"This was not about checking off a box and making sure we did what regulators would want us to do, or what NGOs would be encouraging us to do,\" said Gowen, \"We wanted to do things that made sense for our business.\" Tackling carbon Verizon's largest source of carbon is its electricity demand, which produced over 5m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2012, accounting for 91% of its GHG emissions. Emissions from the telecoms sector are indirect and covered by international agreements, such as the Kyoto protocol or EU Emissions Trading System. But Verizon's carbon intensity, measured in terabytes per metric tonne of CO2, has according to the company reduced by 37% since 2009, when it set a target to halve its carbon intensity by 2020. \"The challenge we faced was that our wireless traffic is growing exponentially with handsets, tablets and anywhere devices. How could we grow efficiently and sustainably? That's what we focused on with the carbon intensity metric, not absolute reductions, but growing as efficiently as possible. A 37% reduction was the easy part, now the tougher part is ahead of us.\" Since Verizon set its carbon intensity target in 2009, data on the company's network has increased by 50% but electricity usage has only increased 2%. However, energy efficiency can only take the company so far. The case for solar power and fuel cell systems Last month, Verizon announced it would invest $100m in solar energy and fuel cell systems this year, which will generate enough electricity to power 19 of its facilities in the US. Gowen insists this is not greenwash and that similar investments have already demonstrated reductions in energy costs and carbon. \"I could easily have said this is the right thing to do, but it would not have flown without a business case,\" he said. \"We looked at a 10-year business plan and made sure that the net present value and a return on investment were positive before we even went to our chief financial officer and made the case for it.\" Superstorm Sandy also made the case very strongly for Gowan and his team. As high winds battered the east coast and a 14-metre storm surge flooded New York, knocking out the power grid for millions of people, Verizon's Garden City switching and administrative centre on Long Island, a 800kWh fuel cell system installed 10 years ago, kept the lights on. \"I had a very unfair advantage while making my case to the CFO,\" he said. \"During Superstorm Sandy, that system never went down and it helped cement our case for resiliency to natural disaster as the natural gas did not get turned off and those fuel cells kept running.\" With around 195,000 global employees and customers worldwide making an estimated 1bn calls a day and sending 780bn texts a year, Verizon can be compared to Google or Microsoft as demand for data services boom. But its 35,000 vehicle fleet turns it into a tech company with a trucking company bolted on, as their services require real people to maintain the cables to homes and businesses. BBQ solutions Verizon's fleet is mostly still powered by fossil fuels that produced 387,723 tonnes of CO2 last year. But it is half way to its 2015 target to run 15% of its fleet run on alternative energy. The company would probably do more with the right signals from policymakers and speedier deployment of infrastructure for alternative fuels, said Gowen. In 2012, Verizon saved 207,653 gallons of fuel from reduced idling time and introduced the Magic Bus, an idea that came from an employee. Technicians in Manhattan are now transported by bus rather than individual vehicles to customer sites. It has taken 250 vehicles off of the NYC streets and will save more 100,000 gallons of gas annually. The Magic Bus might be a drop in the ocean of oil guzzled by Verizon's fleet. But it's still 645 tonnes of avoided carbon emissions and 250 parking spaces freed up in congested Manhattan, said Gowen. It's also just the kind of example of employee engagement the company has actively encouraged with its internal Green Team initiative. \"I get more emails from staff at Verizon encouraging us to do more. We want people talking about it at their BBQs and bringing solutions back to work and we want them to take ideas from work and bring them to the backyard BBQs. That's the home run –that's beyond anything that Verizon could ever do and that's how you create social change.\" No silver bullet Verizon has managed to implement these changes without slipping from the top 20 Fortune 500 companies. \"Shareholder response has been very strong,\" he said. \"They are a very targeted audience that care about how they invest when it comes to 'green' companies. But more importantly, shareholders have been our customers who outsource their data or telecoms requirements to us and they want to make sure that they are dealing with a green company. \"There's no silver bullet but what customers and shareholders are concerned about is how you position yourself for the future from a disaster recovery perspective and from a financial situation – and that's the story that Verizon really has its hands around.\" This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Even though the number of construction contracts awarded in London and the South East fell by 35% last year, the number of projects there still outstripped that of all other areas of the UK by at least 25%, according to analysis by data provider Barbour ABI. Consequently, it is tempting for companies with a choice of operating bases to draw back from regional markets, but an increasing number of firms are recognising that the equation is not quite that simple. Most construction sector analysts predict a return to stability or even marginal growth in 2014, and the rush to close regional operations seems to be dwindling. In a survey of almost 1000 companies soon to be published by Building magazine, only 9% said they anticipated cutting their number of regional branches in the next year. This offers a renewed hope for the industry's potential to drive economic growth in regional communities –and the logic for public sector clients to capitalise on this to boost recovery is hardly controversial. The UK's transport infrastructure is nowhere near the quality it needs to be to support the government's ambition for stronger business centres outside of London, or to service the demands of a population that has grown by almost four million people in the last ten years. The immediate need for work in many sectors also remains strongest away from the south. For example, of the 261 schools the government identified as most in need of urgent renewal work under its Priority School Building Programme, 158 were in the north or midlands. Construction businesses have proven themselves more than capable of delivering these facilities in ways that will save the public sector money in the long term, through more efficient use of space and reduction in energy bills. However, for the economic benefits of regional construction work to stand a chance of being realised, two crucial steps must be taken by public sector leadership. The first is for those at the heart of government to give the industry confidence in the outlook for regional markets by being consistent about the policies which guide the creation of large scale development programmes. It is no coincidence that rafts of construction businesses are investing in developing solutions for the schools sector, where the government has outlined a pipeline of work and clearly stated its overall cost and delivery ambitions . But by contrast, some major companies have cut investment in green energy divisions after repeated government u-turns over policies designed to address climate change. Listed contractor Carillion, for example, axed more than 1000 jobs after the government cut subsidies for solar energy. The second necessary step – which affects the ability of construction to deliver lasting benefits to a community - is to give even greater consideration to the price being offered for work. Obviously, in the economic reality in which we find ourselves, the cost of building needs to be reduced – but clients need to be careful they do not reduce costs so much that the buildings cannot be built to an acceptable standard of functionality or visual design. They need more than ever to ensure proper consideration is given to the specifics of the site or location involved, and costs adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, there is a risk that construction firms will turn away from projects, and a lack of competition will put the quality of buildings at risk. For example, the Priority School Building Programme, in common with the majority of national construction programmes, applies location factors to the cost of work in different regions – so a higher price is budgeted for work in London and the south east, where it is traditionally more expensive to build. But with margins under the programme already tight, some contractors have privately admitted that they feel deterred from bidding on regional work because they are not confident of being able to turn a profit. This programme may have only just launched, but if situations like this are not watched closely, we could have a situation where competition for regional work becomes reduced to the detriment of the finished buildings. Or, contractors will build to lower specifications than those currently being asked for, which would mean the buildings produced would be of poorer quality than their London counterparts. Either scenario would perpetuate, rather than solve, the damaging regional divide that construction work has the opportunity to address.

As a scientist who studies this topic daily, I and my colleagues know why. Human greenhouse gas emissions have led to a 40% increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, the Earth is gaining energy at an alarming rate. So what? How will all this energy change the climate (and the weather we experience)? Well some changes are pretty straightforward… First scientists expect that the Earth will globally get warmer, although the warming will happen much faster in some areas than others. We expect the rate of drying (and consequently drought) will increase in some areas while other regions will become wetter with more flooding. We expect to lose ice, see oceans rise, changes to the ocean acidity level, among other changes. Some changes, however, have been harder to unearth but recent exciting findings are shining some illumination. Among the most exciting areas of research is the connection between loss of arctic sea ice and extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere. The arctic, which has been warming at an alarming rate has seen an approximately 75% decrease in the summer sea ice volume. Consequently arctic waters, which had been covered by ice, are now absorbing tremendous amounts of solar energy during the summer and releasing it to the atmosphere during the autumn and early winter. This change in the arctic energy balance has begun to have an effect on the weather patterns, particularly on the jet stream. This rapidly flowing stream of high-altitude air separates the cold dry arctic air from warmer moist air closer to the equator. When that jet stream dips southward, watch out! Cold air and potential downpours or snow storms may be coming your way. Recently, the jet stream has been more likely to be found in an undulating, slowly moving state. What does this mean to us? It means that we shouldn't be surprised to see more severe weather that lasts for longer durations. Our weather can be expected to whiplash from one extreme to another. In the U.S. we are seeing some evidence of this. Alternating wet, snowy winters and warm non-winters. Summers of either extreme heat and drought – or unbelievable flooding. But don't just take my word for it. A leading researcher in this area, Dr. Jennifer Francis says, The Arctic is warming two-to-three times faster than the rest of the northern hemisphere -- the loss of sea ice, spring snow cover, increased Greenland melting, and permafrost degradation are all symptoms of and contributors to this warming. It's inconceivable that a change of this scale and magnitude will not have substantial impacts on the atmosphere, ocean, and land both within the Arctic and also beyond the Arctic where millions of people live. These impacts will affect not only the physical system -- such as weather patterns and ocean circulation -- but also life on land and in the ocean. Exactly how these effects play out is a wide-open topic of research. Regarding the specific impact of global warming on Superstorm Sandy, her colleague, Dr. Charles Greene added, Images of flooded subway stations in New York City, demolished towns on the New Jersey shore, and autumn blizzard conditions in Appalachia will be etched in the nation's psyche for quite some time. With the increasing frequency of extreme weather events serving as a backdrop, many people are asking what role, if any, did anthropogenic climate change play in the development of Superstorm Sandy? If one takes into account the record loss of Arctic sea ice this past September, then perhaps the likelihood of greenhouse warming playing a significant role in Sandy's evolution as an extra-tropical superstorm is at least as plausible as the idea that (she) was simply a freak of nature. If we are seeing this type of extreme weather already, it makes one wonder what the world will be like in 10, 20, or 50 years. We will certainly have to deal with many more costly weather disasters. More European heat waves like 2003 or 2010; more Midwest United States droughts of 2011 and 2012. Repeated 1000 year floods, larger storms like Sandy, and yes…. We will even see snow… lots of it. Charles Greene's November 2012 Scientific American paper was prescient – he virtually predicted the extreme weather, including Sandy and the series of nor'easters that have battered the Eastern Seaboard this past winter. It makes one wonder about other events. The alternating years of droughts and floods in the Midwest that have converted last year's severe dryout into today's severe floods in Indiana and Illinois? Are they tied to human emissions? What about the oscillating heat waves/drought and flooding episodes in Australia? We can only hope that this emerging science continues to advance so that these questions can be answered. There are two takeaway messages to all of this. First, all of today's weather is now affected by climate change. Second, there is a tremendous cost to the extremes we are seeing. For those who say taking action to stop climate change is too expensive, we only have to point to the costs we are incurring right now. It is clear that it is too expensive to ignore this problem. But don't just take it from me, ask my students. Engineering student Sara Backlund, who attends my heat transfer course recently remarked, Last summer was crazy hot – so hot my soccer games had to be cut short. This spring it is incredibly cold – it's May and we haven't even started practicing and our games are being canceled. Even I can see the weather is changing… So, it may not take a rocket scientist to tell us we're changing the weather… It might just take a bright engineering student. • Dr. John Abraham of University of St. Thomas, the Climate Science Rapid Response Team and the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/national-trust-wales-eco-castle","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-16T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"National Trust Wales: king of the eco-castle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/national-trust-wales-eco-castle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/national-trust-wales-eco-castle","fields":{"headline":"National Trust Wales: king of the eco-castle","bodyText":"Welsh rain has long served to guarantee the country's water supplies, but now it is being harnessed to serve the energy needs of heritage, tourism and local people. Water-generated power is one of the most effective tools National Trust Wales is developing as part of a strategy that touches its entire estate. It is a strategy that looks forward as well as back, as, according to National Trust Wales environmental practices adviser Keith Jones, the country's smallest villages used renewable energy technology to generate their own private electricity supply long before most of the big cities. Jones explains: \"In fact, rural Wales has been generating hydro electricity for almost 150 years. Wales was at the cutting edge of hydroelectricity development with a small army of foundries, engineers and dedicated families driving development and innovation.\" Now the National Trust is going into partnership with communities to see if that pattern can be repeated with modern technology. The transformational change taking place within National Trust Wales has made it the clear winner in the energy category. Judges held the organisation up as an example of exactly what they were looking for, saying: \"It shows that heritage shouldn't stop sustainability – their approach was challenging and broad ranging – very large energy savings, moving towards energy independence, while preserving national heritage.\" National Trust Wales owns properties as diverse as the medieval fortress, Chirk Castle and crofts in Llŷn. It encompasses visitor centres and bunkhouses, a Tudor merchant's house and old coastguard cottages, along with the 19th century neo-Norman Penrhyn castle and Tredegar House in south-east Wales, home to the Morgan family for 500 years. For some time, the charity has connected its stewardship of the country's heritage to its ambition to prove it can insulate even the most sensitive buildings, as well as generate energy in the most protected landscapes. Indeed, it has already nearly halved its energy use and is well on the way to generating all of its energy needs from renewable sources at its Welsh properties. Investment in 190 separate projects have encompassed groundbreaking technology as varied as modern light bulbs to the UK's first marine source heat pump. It has explored biomass boilers and solar energy, as well as hydro. Thanks to these projects the Trust will provide all the energy it needs by 2015. Some 350kw of photovoltaic panels installed across its estate already account for 12% of that demand. There are plans for at least 40 more, as well as for nine hydro sites. Three of these are at the final design stage. Hydro is critically important. About half all the Trust's energy will be generated this way by the end of 2013. In fact, one project alone will supply enough electricity for every mansion and house the Trust manages in Wales. It is no surprise that their work has captured public interest. Situated on the southern slopes of Snowdon, it uses the overflow from Afon Cwm Llan and channels it through a pipe into a turbine on the National Trust's Hafod y Llan farm. But hydro is not all the National Trust is discovering, as it focuses on sustainable energy. It is also learning about sustainable buildings such as Pontbremydyr, a 300-year-old cottage in mid-Wales that has all the ingredients of a modern eco-house. It is made of breathable clom (clay and straw), breathable lime paints, has a straw roof and small low heat-loss windows. All the materials used to build it come from a few hundred metres away. A more futuristic scheme also draws on long-established knowledge that seawater and the ground retain heat. On this basis, the charity is planning what could be the UK's first large-scale marine source heat pump at the 18th century mansion, Plas Newydd. The building is the home of the Marquess of Anglesey on the Menai Strait. A marine-sourced heat pump would mean the Trust no longer has to buy and store the 128,000 litres of heating oil needed to keep this famous attraction going. The National Trust Wales embarked on the programme, Fit for the Future, to focus on managing resources and reducing its environmental impact. Over the past five years, the programme has incorporated training workshops, energy efficiency and large-scale investment. Despite adding two new properties to its estate in 2012, which raised energy use by 9.5%, the Trust cut total fossil fuel usage in that year by 33%, compared to 2009. It's also making money from renewable energy – in 2012 revenue amounted to £100,000, complementing cost savings of £350,000. The Trust anticipates savings will rise to £650,000 by 2014. It has been keen to collaborate. A new LED candle bulb was developed with a partner company, filling a gap in the market and helping the partner business grow. It is filling the gaps in the electric car network by installing charging points in all its car parks in Wales. An underlying principle of the programme is to share what the Trust has learned and dispel myths that historically significant estates are difficult to treat. Properties run by National Trust Wales include mansions using 1500 litres of oil a day. Others have 100 year-old heating systems and some of the oldest infrastructure in UK. So its mission to reduce energy use went through several stages. First of all, it had to survey, review and investigate. The next stage was to monitor. It installed smart meters and moved from 99% estimated billing to 99.5% actual. Then it devised plans to calculate the cost of different technologies for every site. The charity can now carbon budget every large property in Wales and based on 2009-2010 figures, it has cut overall energy use by 41% and carbon production by 46% a year. Its approach to energy has proved so successful that the program has expanded to cover all its resources, even paper clips. Water use and bills have fallen by 42%, winning National Trust Wales the Waterwise award for innovation. The company is hosting local sharing workshops to enable the community to become sustainable in transport and energy. In another innovation, it is forming commercial partnerships with communities on energy projects and working with social housing groups.

In India, nearly half of all health facilities – serving an estimated 580 million people – lack electricity, according to this year's Poor People's Energy Outlook (pdf), published on Wednesday by the NGO Practical Action. A further 255 million people are served by health centres without electricity in sub-Saharan Africa, it says, where over 30% of facilities lack power. \"For critical and urgent health services such as emergency treatments and childbirth, staff have no option but to cope as well as possible in low lighting or in the dark, increasing the risk for all patients, including mothers and babies,\" the report says. Even where health centres have access to power, frequent power shortages significantly hamper the ability to provide quality care, it says. In Kenya, for example, only 25% of facilities have a reliable energy supply, and blackouts happen at least six times a month, for an average of 4.5 hours at a time. This \"directly affects services such as childbirth and emergency treatment, and limits night-time services. It can also lead to wasted vaccines, blood and medicines that require constant storage temperatures. Backup generators can be extremely expensive,\" the report says. Energy has shot up the international agenda, buoyed by the Sustainable Energy for All initiative led by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, which aims to achieve universal access to energy by 2030 along with efficiency gains and increased use of renewable energy. Wednesday's report, however, warns that too little attention has been paid to the needs of critical community services, putting progress on development goals, particularly on health and education, at risk. \"Governments, donors and utilities focus mostly on domestic use and access for enterprise,\" the report says. \"Yet some of the most important aspects of people's daily wellbeing are dependent on the reliable delivery of modern energy not to their homes or places of work, but to schools, clinics, institutions and community infrastructure.\" In Bangladesh, the government has failed to prioritise or even measure energy needed and used by critical community services, Maliha Shahjahan, energy specialist for Practical Action, said. \"Government spending in energy sector is not considering the needs of the energy poor people of Bangladesh … [and] the government is mostly concern about the urban users, both domestic and private sectors,\" she said. Practical Action's advocacy lead on energy issues, Helen Morton, said: \"The historic neglect of energy in community services undermines the ability to deliver education, healthcare and ultimately development. [This report] makes the case for the energy services that poor people want, need and have a right to – providing communities with the power to challenge their poverty.\" In addition to surveying the energy needs of health facilities, the report also estimates that half of primary school students in developing countries – more than 291 million children – go to schools without access to electricity. For many, this could mean struggling with cold, damp and poorly ventilated rooms, which can exacerbate health problems, it says. In Bangladesh, Practical Action researchers found teachers forced to keep classroom windows open during the cold season in order to let in natural light. In Bolivia, they heard how students at one school had to cut their lessons short to collect firewood needed to cook their midday meals on inefficient wood stoves. According to estimates, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest rate of primary school access to electricity, at 35%, compared with 48% in south Asia and 93% in Latin America. In some sub-Saharan African countries, such as Burundi, only 2% of primary schools have electricity. As with health centres, schools in rural areas are disproportionately affected by energy poverty, notes the report. Drew Corbyn, energy consultant at Practical Action, said many community facilities may be using solar energy, or other small-scale energy technologies, although data on their use and impact is extremely sparse. \"Some of these intermediate technologies can play a very big role, and really transform service delivery … rather than waiting for the grids to extend,\" he said. The report sets out a new, multi-tier framework for measuring people's access to energy, developed by Practical Action with the UN and the World Bank, as an alternative to current systems that it says ignore the needs of poor people by focusing on large-scale, grid-based energy supply. \"Critical to determining how we tackle energy poverty is the way in which access to energy is defined,\" it says. \"In the past, energy access has been described as household connection to grid electricity and the use of a modern fuel. This fails to recognise the use of energy for productive ends or community services, neglects the role of intermediate energy technologies and does not consider how people use and ultimately benefit from energy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/13/government-appeal-solar-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-13T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Court appeal over solar subsidies will prolong industry uncertainty | Andrew Pendleton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/13/government-appeal-solar-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/13/government-appeal-solar-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Court appeal over solar subsidies will prolong industry uncertainty","bodyText":"Today the UK government attempts to overturn its lost court case on solar power. At the end of last year, with little warning, the nascent solar industry was plunged into chaos when ministers decided to slash support for clean energy. Uncertainty spread among companies and consumers alike, and nearly 30,000 jobs were jeopardised. After an initial rush to get solar panels installed on roofs before the 12 December cut-off date, orders dried up and businesses ground to a halt. At a time of economic gloom, one of Britain's most successful home-grown industries has been spectacularly torpedoed – with ministers claiming they had no choice but to push the button. But by cutting solar subsidies 11 days before its consultation had even ended, Friends of the Earth believed the government had acted unlawfully. This was confirmed by the high court when it upheld a legal challenge we brought alongside solar firms Solarcentury and HomeSun in December. Today's appeal by the government will simply prolong the uncertainty, leaving businesses on tenterhooks about tariff rates for both future installations and those backdating to 12 December – and it could cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds. The government's argument that we can't afford to support solar doesn't stand up. Last year the solar industry alone raked in three times as much cash for the Treasury than the entire feed-in tariff scheme had cost for all clean energy systems. Calculations by Friends of the Earth and consultants Element Energy show that income tax, VAT and corporation tax from the solar industry bring in at least £330m per year, while last year the feed-in tariff scheme cost just £110m. The government should use this money to provide additional funding for feed-in tariffs – rather than going ahead with current plans that could shrink the solar industry to just 10% of its current size, and shed nearly tens of thousands of jobs. Critics say the scheme is a middle class subsidy. They're wrong. Over the last few weeks I've spoken to councils, housing associations and community groups that are among the worst affected by government's cuts. Brighton and Hove council is axeing a scheme to install solar panels on the roofs of 1,600 council homes – which would have delivered cheap, clean power to thousands of the city's poorest and most vulnerable residents. Thanks to the government's recklessness, just 20 of those houses have clean power and the whole project is now at risk. In Hampshire, the Aster housing association is suspending plans to fit a thousand homes with solar panels – with income channelled towards affordable warmth initiatives for other houses that don't have solar. And on the Pembury estate in Hackney in London – hit by rioting last summer – the Peabody Trust housing association has halted a scheme that's seen nearly 2,000 solar panels fitted to blocks of flats. The project was set up to slash tenants fuel bills by up to £150 every year and cut carbon emissions by 170 tonnes annually. This is just a snapshot. Across the country there are countless more examples. Greg Barker is right in saying that we can't build a sustainable future for Britain in the court room, but demonstrating that it would be illegal for the government to cut payments for past installations is vital to restore investor confidence in the feed-in tariff scheme. Friends of the Earth agrees that payments must come down – in line with the falling cost of installing solar panels. But rather than fighting the high court's ruling with this appeal, the government should be bringing proposals before parliament to cut tariff rates in a planned and legal way from February. Every day it delays action is another day before tariffs fall. And instead of planning to impose impossibly tough energy efficiency requirements on households, the overnment should require households to install loft and cavity wall installation where it is physically possible to do so. Yes, we need proper dialogue between Government, industry and NGOs, but it is the government who must show leadership in getting the solar industry back on a stable footing and support its continued growth. If the government wants to help cash-strapped, ordinary people cut their fuel bills and benefit from generating their own clean solar power, Greg Barker must persuade the Treasury to lift the spending cap imposed on the feed-in tariff scheme and increase the pot of money available – using increased tax revenues from the solar sector that the feed-in tariff scheme has brought in. This way, we won't have to pay for it through our bills. Now, more than ever, people are looking to politicians for a better deal when it comes to energy. The success of solar feed-in tariffs demonstrates the huge appetite in the UK for generating homegrown renewable power. That's why Friends of the Earth has launched its Final Demand campaign, calling on the government to get us off the hook of expensive, imported fossil fuels and offer more support for solar power – a stand-out British success story. • Andrew Pendleton is the head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/aug/16/stock-markets-jittery-over-fears-federal-reserve-set-to-taper-stimulus-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-16T14:15:45Z","webTitle":"Stock markets jittery over fears Federal Reserve set to taper stimulus – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/16/stock-markets-jittery-over-fears-federal-reserve-set-to-taper-stimulus-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/aug/16/stock-markets-jittery-over-fears-federal-reserve-set-to-taper-stimulus-live","fields":{"headline":"Stock markets jittery over fears Federal Reserve set to taper stimulus – as it happened","bodyText":"We are ending a bit early today to go off and enjoy the summer weather.

Emigration in 2008 was 734k while it was only 679k in 2011. Over the last decade the amount of people leaving Germany has been relatively steady at 600-700k. Immigration has however increased: From 682k in 2008, 960k in 2011 and 2012 it was 1.1 million (net migration 400-500k). One US residence with no problem finding building materials is the White House, which is installing solar panels on the roof. An official told the Wall Street Journal the panels: will help demonstrate that historic buildings can incorporate solar energy and energy efficiency upgrades. US housing starts and permits for future homes rose less than expected in July, suggesting higher mortgage rates could be slowing the housing market's momentum. Housing starts increased 5.9% to 896,000 units in July and June's starts were revised up to 846,000 from 836,000. However, the rise was lower than the expected 900,000. Permits rose 2.7% in July to 943,000, slightly below the 945,000 expected. Mortgage rates have risen in anticipation at the Fed's tapering of its quantatative easing, expected to start next month. Builders have also complained that there is a shortage of labour and building materials. An interesting piece by Public Service Europe suggesting a Merkel win in the upcoming elections on September 22 will be good for business. The article says: The quarterly FT/Economist Global Business Barometer revealed that 60 per cent of 1,500 top business people polled believe the re-election of the centre-right leader would improve their confidence in Europe's economic prospects. Just 16 per cent would be less confident in the region's financial future following a Merkel victory. It quotes Merkel telling German television: I believe that in Europe at the moment we have to take care to coordinate our competitiveness more closely. We don't have to do everything in Brussels. We can also consider whether we can give something back. China and Japan have emerged as the leaders of an exodus from US Treasuries in June following the first signals from the US central bank that it could end its stimulus packages, new data shows. The two nations accounted for nearly all the record $40.8bn of net foreign selling. The sales were part of a $66.9bn of net sales by foreigners of long-term US securities in June – the fifth straight month of outflows. China, the largest foreign creditor reduced its holdings to $1.276tn and Japan reduced its holdings for the third month in a row to $1.08tn. Suggestions of a reduction to the US Fed's quantitative easing programme has pushed five-year yields to 1.53% today, from 0.65% in May. By comparison the yield on a five-year euro mid-swaps has gone to 1.19% from 0.61%. Some Asian bond issuers are now suggesting more euro-denominated bonds could be issued as a result. One banker told Reuters: “There is no talk of tapering in Europe, so interest rate volatility should be smaller than in the [US] Treasury market.” Cross currency basis swaps from euros to dollars has also improved, meaning that funding in euros is becoming cheaper for the many Asian issuers that routinely swap back to dollars. Another sign of the unsteady recovery in Europe comes in the form of the car market, which recorded another mixed message. Registrations of new cars in Europe jumped 4.8% in July compared with the same month a year ago, to 1.02m vehicles. However, registrations in the first seven months of the year fell 5.2% to 7.46m. One reason for the slight year-on-year increase was an extra working day in Germany's motoring sector. While the trade surplus may have widened in June from last year, imports continue to fall. Imports to the 17 countries using the euro fell 6% on the year for a second consecutive month in June, while exports extended their fall to 3% - a second monthly drop in a row. Consumer prices fell by 0.5% on the month in July, with prices falling in all areas except services and energy costs. Today's excitement has got a bit much for Jennifer, who had to head off. Simon Neville will now be taking over the blog for the rest of the day and attempt to bring you the rest of the day's events. Eurozone inflation data is in, and was in line with expectations at 1.6% for July, making it the sixth straight month the rate has been below the ECB's 2% target. And below is a chart showing how the trade surplus has increased to €196.1bn compared with €66.1bn last year The euro area notched up a trade surplus of €16.9 bn (£26.bn) in June 2013, the European Central Bank reported this morning. This reflected €11.8 bn surplus for goods, €8.7 bn services and €6.4 bn income. This was partly offset by a €10.1 bn deficit for current transfers . Figures are seasonally adjusted. Another sign of slowdown in the global economy? Maersk Line, the world's biggest container shipper, has cut its forecast in demand for containers to 2-3%, down from 2-4%. The Danish company accounts for 15% of the world's shipping container capacity. Maersk's profits still look healthy: it reported a $439m (£281m) profit for the second quarter of 2013, up from $227m a year earlier. Strange goings on on the Shanghai stock market today. The Shanghai Composite index closed 0.6% down, but not before an unexpected 6% surge in value earlier in the day. Shanghai-listed Everbright Securities suspended trading of its shares and said it was investigating a problem with its operating system. This morning, Everbright Securities strategic investment department's proprietary trading bureau had a problem when using its own arbitrage system. The company is investigating and dealing with the issue. Market watchers are blaming a lone trader with a “fat finger”. European markets have opened flat after yesterday's losses. UK FTSE: +0.09% at 6489 points France's Cac +0.19% at 4101 German Dax: -0.03% at 8374 Italy's FTSE MIB: - 0.01% at 17,461 Spain's Ibex: -0.01% at 8736 Investor worries over stimulus have also helped to bring down oil prices. Bloodshed in Egypt had sent the price of a barrel of Brent Crude to a four-month high of $111 on Thursday, but it has slipped back to $110. Egypt is not a major oil supplier, but investors are worried that the unrest could destablise oil transport throughout the Middle East. Egypt produces 728,000 barrels if oil a day, about 0.9% of global output, and accounts for 1.8% of the world's gas supply. BP has said their oil production in Egypt is unaffected, although Shell has closed its office for a few days. Meanwhile Tunisia, the north African country that was the cradle of the Arab Spring, has had its credit rating cut. As Fast FT reports, Standard and Poors have downgraded Tunisia's sovereign rating by two notches from BB to B. The rating agency said fears of terrorist attacks threatened Tunisia's vital tourist industry. We view the popular legitimacy of Tunisia's transitional institutions as increasingly contested, jeopardizing the approval of a new constitution, holding of elections, and implementation of growth-promoting economic reforms. Quote via Fast FT (metred paywall) Welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. European markets are expected to open lower this morning, as investors remain jittery that the US Federal Reserve will start to cut its massive stimulus programme from September. Asian markets are slightly down today, after the biggest one-day selloff in the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 since June. Investors remain fretful although members of the Fed say they are still making up their minds about cutting the $85bn bond-buying programme. A voting member of the monetary-policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, James Bullard, said yesterday that he would like to see more data before reaching a decision. As the Wall Street Journal (paywall) reports, he said: We don't have to be in a hurry to taper. But as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets observes, this is not stopping investors from selling stocks: It would appear that the weight of expectation surrounding an imminent tapering of asset purchases, along with a host of disappointing company earnings announcements, has prompted markets into thinking that a September taper is pretty much a done deal. What makes this conclusion all the more surprising is that apart from yesterday’s weekly jobless claims, the economic data was by and large pretty disappointing, coming in below expectations across the board. We are also expecting European inflation data at 10am.

The flagship scheme, launched in January, allows householders to repay long-term loans for installing up to 40 different energy saving technologies via their electricity bills. But it was widely criticised at its launch for failing to provide enough incentives for the householder and for being overly complex. \"I would not expect many people to apply for finance yet. It's a bit too early,\" said Davey. \"I won't concede that loan costs are too high. You have to compare it with unsecured loan and not mortgages. This is a great deal,\" he told delegates at Ecobuild, a sustainable building show in London. \"We are not trying to pretend that we have everything right. There will be issues to address. We will be responsive to get rid of the niggles,\" he said. Davey fuelled rumours that the scheme had been poorly taken up by the public, citing \"legal reasons\" for not disclosing how many households had so far asked for assessments on the energy efficiency of their homes or the number of people who had applied for loans. \"Our plan is to issue monthly reports starting this spring,\" he said. Instead, he claimed that industry was fully supportive, with 40 companies now approved as green deal \"providers\" and 75 organisations registered as \"assessors\". In addition, he said, 600 installers had now been trained. \"There is already a good pipeline of work, good signs of momentum,\" he said. \"Assessors are there in big numbers and increasing all the time.\" He predicted that by 2015, more than 1m separate pieces of home improvement under the green deal would have been installed. \"There is a huge business opportunity for green growth and jobs. [We estimate] there could be 136,000 jobs in energy efficiency with the numbers rising 5% a year. Eight million homes need solid wall insulation, 6m could get more loft insulation.\" But the former senior civil servant Richard McCarthy, director for central government at Capita Symonds, said the government should try to make it easier for people to understand. \"Perception is all. Not enough people truly understand what the green deal is about and don't see the incentive. Myths and fears need to be dispelled. There are real benefits but these need explaining. It needs to be easier to navigate. \"The relative cost of the loans is higher than most mortgages. People are challenged by the numbers. It adds fuel to their fears of taking up more debt. More credit checks are occurring. You can understand, but there's the creeping [idea] that this will make it harder for some householders to access finance. There is more room to be flexible and to bring costs down,\" he said. Tim Pollard, head of sustainability at Wolseley, which owns Plumb Centre and has so far trained more than 50 installers, said: \"The perception has been wrong. People are beginning to understand. But there is still a large gap. Nobody I know was expecting a tsunami of demand. Demand is encouraging.\" Others said that the loans were too expensive. \"Green deal will pay back over time. But some people may get funds cheaper. People can't see that they will get a good deal like they did with the feed-in tariffs for solar energy,\" said one installer who asked not to be named. The industry was divided on the initial take up. \"It is delivering. Based on the feedback we have had, it has changed the nature of the conversation about energy efficiency,\" said Paul King, chief executive of the Green Building Council. \"There is a very live discussion about the creation of a new industry with the potential of 26 million customers in the UK. It is possible to see an explosion of interest in a few years' time.\" But King called on government to provide industry and householders with better incentives, including home taxes based on the energy efficiency of homes, and certainty about building regulations in the next few years. \"The challenge is how do we rebuild Britain for 2050,\" he said. However, some small companies said they feared that green deal would undermine their businesses. Stephen Bull, who runs a plumbing and heating firm with 2,000 customers in London, said that the green deal scheme was complex, expensive for small builders to take part in, and could undermine his business. \"We want to make sure we don't get left behind and I want to become an installer. But it seems to be a very much a top-down approach, set up by big business for big business. It seems only suitable for them. We could actually lose our clients to big multinational companies. \"In principle the idea is good and I want it to work. But even if I become a green deal installer, I would not necessarily get the work from my existing clients. I am struggling to understand it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/14/global-warming-solar-minimum-barely-dent","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-14T04:52:46Z","webTitle":"A grand solar minimum would barely make a dent in human-caused global warming | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/14/global-warming-solar-minimum-barely-dent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/14/global-warming-solar-minimum-barely-dent","fields":{"headline":"A grand solar minimum would barely make a dent in human-caused global warming","bodyText":"Recent articles in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten (translation available here) and in the Irish Times both ran headlines claiming that another grand solar minimum could potentially trigger an \"ice age\" or \"mini ice age\" this century. These articles actually refer to the Little Ice Age (LIA) – a period about 500 to 150 years ago when global surface temperatures were approximately 1°C colder than they are today. This is quite different from an ice age, which are more like 5°C colder than today. The LIA was not actually very cold on a global scale. So, in order to trigger another LIA, a new grand solar minimum would have to cause about 1°C cooling, plus it would have to offset the continued human-caused global warming of 1 to 5°C by 2100, depending on how our greenhouse gas emissions change over the next century. In the Jyllands-Posten article, Henrik Svensmark (the main scientist behind the hypothesis that the sun has a significant indirect impact on global climate via galactic cosmic rays) was a bit more measured, suggesting, \"I can imagine that it will become 0.2°C colder. I would be surprised if it became 1–2°C\" So these two articles are suggesting that a grand solar minimum could have a net cooling effect in the ballpark of 1 to 6°C, depending on how human greenhouse gas emissions change over the next century. Is it plausible that a grand solar minimum could make that happen? The short answer is, 'No.' Fortunately, Solar Output is Stable We're fortunate that the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface is very stable. Climate contrarians will often ask if we'd prefer if the planet were warming or cooling, suggesting that global warming is a good thing because at least the planet isn't getting colder. This is a false dichotomy - an ideal climate is a stable one. The relatively stable climate over the past 10,000 years has allowed establishment of human civilization, by making it possible to create large stationary agricultural farms because we could rely on stable weather patterns. During that time, net global surface temperatures changes haven't exceeded 1°C from the coldest to the hottest climates, though we're now approaching that degree of change, with 1°C warming since the LIA, 0.8°C of that over the past century, with much more to come. What difference would a grand solar minimum make in the amount of solar energy reaching Earth? Two examples are the Maunder Minimum, a period of very low solar activity between 1645 and 1715, and the Dalton Minimum, a period of low (but not as low as the Maunder Minimum) solar activity between 1790 and 1830. Relative to current levels, the Dalton Minimum represents a 0.08% decrease in the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, and the Maunder Minimum represents a 0.25% decline. That's how stable solar activity is. That's also why we're playing with fire by increasing the greenhouse effect so much and so quickly. We're threatening the stability of the climate that has been so favorable to our development. Peer-Reviewed Research Says Global Warming will Continue There have been several studies in recent years investigating what impact another grand solar minimum would have on global surface temperatures, since solar research suggests it's possible we could be due for another extended solar minimum. Generally these studies will run climate model simulations under a given greenhouse gas emissions scenario with stable solar activity, then run the same scenario with the sun going into a grand minimum, and look at the difference in resulting global surface temperature changes. Using this approach, Feulner &amp; Rahmstorf (2010) (PDF available here) estimated that another solar minimum equivalent to the Dalton and Maunder minima would cause 0.09°C and 0.26°C cooling, respectively. Jones et al. (2012) (PDF available here) arrived at a nearly identical result, with cooling from another Dalton and Maunder minimum at 0.09°C and 0.26°C, respectively. Similarly, a new paper by Anet et al. (2013) found that a grand solar minimum will cause no more than 0.3°C cooling over the 21st century. Consistent with these previous studies, Meehl et al. (2013) (PDF available here) estimate a Maunder Minimum would cause about 0.26°C cooling, but as soon as solar activity began to rise again, that cooling would be offset by solar warming. This is a key point, because a grand solar minimum would not be a permanent change. These solar minima last for a few decades, but eventually solar activity rises once again. Thus any cooling caused by a solar minimum would only be temporary. The cooling effect of a grand solar minimum can also be estimated very easily without the aid of climate models, because the change in the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the temperature change it causes. Performing this calculation yields the same result as the model-based research: approximately 0.3°C cooling from another Maunder-type grand solar minimum. Click here to see the details behind the calculation. The Heating of the Deep Oceans In the Jyllands-Posten article, Svensmark also disputes the data showing the accelerated accumulation of heat in the deep oceans. \"How can the ocean below 700 meters be heated up, without the upper ocean warming up accordingly?\" This is an increasingly common argument made by climate contrarians, and a bit of a strange one. The data are what they are - we've measured the deep ocean warming, including with reliable instruments on Argo buoys for close to a decade now. Even if we couldn't explain how the heat got there, it's there. But let's address the question anyway - do we expect to have seen some obvious indication of heat being transferred from the shallow to deep ocean layers? It's certainly not clear that we should. Consider the analogy of a bathtub. Water from the faucet represents heat entering the shallow ocean layer. Water exiting the drain represents heat leaving the shallow oceans and entering the deep oceans. The water level in the bathtub represents the heat in the shallow ocean layer (which is what we measure). If the amount of water entering the tub from the faucet is the same as the amount of water draining out of the tub, the water level in the tub won't change. Yet the water still flows down the drain. Climate scientist Gavin Schmidt has discussed this point, summarized here. In short, we wouldn't necessarily see the heat being transferred through the shallow to the deep oceans. However, there has been plenty of warming of the shallow oceans that could have been transferred to the deeper oceans. In our case, the water is flowing into the tub faster than it's draining out - the shallow oceans are warming fast, as the figure above illustrates. Svensmark Gets Ocean Warming Wrong Unfortunately Svensmark appears to be unfamiliar with this ocean heating data, saying, \"The thousands of buoys that we have deployed after 2003 to measure the ocean temperature, have not registered any temperature rise.\" This is just totally wrong, even if we ignore the rapid warming of the deep oceans (as is clear from a simple examination of the figure above). The ocean heat content data can be downloaded from the National Oceanographic Data Center here. The heating trend since 2003 in the upper 700 meters of oceans is equivalent to nearly 1 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonation per second (plus another 3 per second in the deep oceans). Both the shallow and deep oceans are accumulating a whole lot of heat, with no signs of slowing whatsoever. If anything, the heating of the oceans and the planet as a whole is accelerating. Human Influence on Climate Change is Bigger than the Sun's The bottom line is that the sun and the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth are very stable. Even during the Maunder and Dalton grand solar minima, global cooling was relatively small - smaller than the amount of global warming caused by human greenhouse gas emissions over the past century. A new grand solar minimum would not trigger another LIA; in fact, the maximum 0.3°C cooling would barely make a dent in the human-caused global warming over the next century. While it would be enough to offset to about a decade's worth of human-caused warming, it's also important to bear in mind that any solar cooling would only be temporary, until the end of the solar minimum. The science is quite clear that the human influence on climate change has become bigger than the sun's. At this point, speculation about another mini ice age is pure fantasy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/fossil-fuel-prices-renewable-energy-attractive","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-21T18:13:55Z","webTitle":"Volatile fossil fuel prices make renewable energy more attractive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/fossil-fuel-prices-renewable-energy-attractive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/fossil-fuel-prices-renewable-energy-attractive","fields":{"headline":"Volatile fossil fuel prices make renewable energy more attractive","bodyText":"Although hundreds of companies book billions of dollars of energy reserves on their balance sheets, the volatility of prices, the regulatory churn, and the swift currents of technological change, produce inefficient levels of investment in these capital-intensive corporations. We race to claim and develop energy reserves using increasingly sophisticated technologies to extract less accessible reserves of carbon. The massive investment required to turn remote, sub-oceanic and dirty resources into profits requires companies to service enormous debt. In Canada, we have been shocked to see the opportunities for growth and potential profits from unconventional energy sources evaporate before our eyes. Perhaps this story is worth telling in a larger arena: what can we do to hedge the risks to companies and governments of energy bubbles? In the last few years in North America, companies have scrambled to drill into the Arctic, reopen the Gulf of Mexico to deep water rigs, frack shale beds throughout the continent, and mine the top 200 feet of much of northern Alberta. They have developed coal gasification technologies and other synthetic liquid fuel processes. None of it is cheap: the capital costs, research and development expenses, environmental compliance outlays and exploration expenditures are enormous. Alone, each of these investments might have brought in enormous profits. Together, they have brought the price of natural gas in North America down to $3.34/MMbtu, or $117.94 per 1000 m3, a level last seen in 2002. (This is half of the UK price and a third of the price in Japan.) Western Canadian Select crude oil (WCS) trades at discounts to Brent that have recently surpassed $40/bbl. There is a glut of oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, creating bottlenecks throughout the system, and there is significant overcapacity in Houston's refining plants. Nobody needs all the oil or gas that Canada is producing. In North America, the race for fuel has outrun demand. This precipitous decline in the price of oil has devastated the tax revenues of Canada and of Alberta, triggering a massive cycle of cuts. Canadian media is full of grim pictures of government ministers whose forecasts are no longer valid and whose promises have been mooted. Alberta's budget notes explain: \"This 'bitumen bubble' has had a severe impact on Alberta's revenue outlook, with a $6.2bn drop in 2013-14 resource revenue from the budget 2012 estimate, and even larger declines in the next several years.\" The volatility of supply and demand is evident in balance sheets. Canadian mining and energy investments are expected to decline in 2013. The oil sands, until recently the driver of Canada's prosperity, no longer produce the revenue needed to service the debt on all the vast investments poured into Alberta. In early February 2013, Suncor Energy Inc, a dominant player in the Alberta oil sands, wrote off $1.5bn it had invested in its long-planned $11.6bn Voyageur oil sands upgrader. There was no reason to spend the next $10bn to upgrade oil sands into bitumen that sells below cost. The discount at which Canadian oil trades against Brent will grow larger and the write-offs more extreme if the Northern Gateway pipeline is rejected by the (probable) new government of British Columbia, and Alberta oil must therefore continue to flow south to Oklahoma rather than west to the Pacific and on to China. Clearly, a country or region so enamoured with its resource base, and confident in the permanence of the advantages and revenues it confers, deserves some level of reproof. Canada's is neither the first nor last case of such hubris. The bubbles will continue to rise and collapse as long as we demand carbon to meet our energy needs. The most effective hedge against a resource whose extraction will necessarily become more difficult and remote is a substitute that will, over time, force its cost down. A recent report from Deutsche Bank says that in numerous markets, solar energy has reached parity with the electrical grid. Subsidies are no longer required to attract investors in India, Italy and Germany. UBS analysts concur. They see the steep decline of the price of power in Europe as a strong indicator that the future of consumer power is almost certainly rooftop solar, even without subsidies. In 2011, Stephen O'Rourke of Deutsche Bank produced a chart that now seems prescient. It is long past time that governments and companies gambled not only with our environmental future, but with our available capital and tax structure. It is time to reconsider our continued public and private investment in volatile energy sources and rebalance our portfolios to reflect the future of renewable energy.

He was speaking in the Commons, where Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, answered questions about the plan. Darling said: I'm sure I'm not the only MP today who has a sense of deja vu when listening to what you had to say. Indeed I seem to remember announcing a number of these projects myself 10 years ago [when Darling was transport secretary], which perhaps demonstrates the problem that we face in that successive governments have found it very difficult to deliver on these large-scale projects, whether on housing or on transport or on energy, which we desperately need. I know that central government planning went out of fashion about 40 or 50 years ago but isn't there a case for actually seeing whether or not central government can't take a grip of these projects to match them up with the funds, including the insurance funds which is a good thing, to make sure these projects actually happen? They are too important for the country to be left to chance and I am sure that you would not want to join the very long list of ministers now who announce these things only to find a few years later they are filled with disappointment because they simply aren't there. • Sir Howard Davies, chair of the airports commission, has written to the Treasury saying his interim report will call for urgent measures to increase airport capacity in the south east of England. • Nick Hurd, the civil society minister, has been criticised for saying that some youth services closed as a result of spending cuts were \"crap\" anyway. • Norman Baker, the Home Office minister, has backed calls for an inquiry into mass surveillance by GCHQ and the National Security Agency. (See 2.47pm.) • Justine Greening, the international development secretary, has revealed that aid worth £80,000 went to Zimbabwe's government, in contravention of government policy. But the money was used properly for a fruit fly eradication project, she said. She made the admission as she announced that a £67m aid programme for southern Africa was being wound up because it has not been effective. • Dame Patricia Hodgson, a former BBC executive and the Ofcom deputy chairwoman, has been named as the government's preferred candidate to be the next Ofcom chair. That's all from me for today. I've got to wind up early. Tomorrow it's the autumn statement. I will be writing a joint blog with Graeme Wearden. Thanks for the comments. Norman Baker, the Lib Dem Home Office minister, has backed calls for an inquiry into the mass surveillance activities of GCHQ and the NSA in America. He was speaking in an interview with the New Statesman's George Eaton. Here's an extract. When I ask him whether he would like to see an inquiry into the allegations of mass surveillance by the British and US intelligence services, he replies without hesitation: “Yes. In my view, it’s perfectly reasonable for the Guardian to raise questions about the balance between the state and the individual to take account of the fact that technology has moved on a huge amount and the law was drafted when we didn’t have the means of communication we do now – Skype and everything else – and the capacity of the security services, or the Americans, to engage in trawling for stuff.” Baker also said that the Home Office was a \"hostile\" environment for a Lid Dem minister. Baker does not attempt to hide the extent of his disagreement with the Home Secretary, describing the atmosphere as “hostile”. “It’s no secret that the Home Office is quite a political department and that the Lib Dems and the Tories probably have more challenges in reaching common positions in that department than in many others,” he tells me. “I think the Conservatives will probably say that because of the external threats we have to have more security than liberty and we have to sacrifice a bit to achieve that. We start at the other end; [we think] that liberty is a precious thing and it’s always possible for someone to say, ‘Give me some of your liberty and I’ll give you more security.’ And going down that road is quite dangerous.” • David Cameron has admitted finding the process for infrastructure development in the UK \"frustrating\". He made the comment in an interview in China as Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, published a national infrastructure plan confirming plans to dispose of Britain's stake in Eurostar as part of a £20bn privatisation programme. Asked about the slow pace of projects like HS2, Cameron said: It is frustrating sometimes that we can't do things faster in Britain but we have a planning system, we have democratic accountability for that planning system, we have a need for everyone to have their say and make their point. That's very important in the British system. I think we can keep that system and that democracy but at the same time accelerate things and make them go faster. If you look at what this Government's done in terms of planning policy, decisions are now being taken faster, including on major infrastructure projects. • The government has confirmed that subsidies for onshore wind and solar energy will be cut, while subsidies for offshore wind will be increased. Ukip's energy spokesman, Roger Helmer, dismissed this as a \"political stunt\". He went on: \"It fails to address the real argument which is the nonsensical and frankly dangerous energy policy this Government is forcing upon UK taxpayers.\" • Business groups have welcomed reports that the government will cap increases in business rates. This is fromJohn Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. It is heartening that the chancellor appears to be listening to business, and is planning to limit the damage caused by relentless business rates increases. But a tax rise is still a tax rise. Although a cap on rates would spare businesses some £300 million in tax hikes, and reliefs help many of the smallest firms, companies of all sizes will still be paying hundreds of millions more in rates to the Exchequer next year than the £27 billion they are expected to pay in this year. • Cameron has said that it is possible to cut taxes and reduce the fiscal deficit at the same time as the economy recovers. As Nicholas Watt reports, Amid fury in Downing Street at reports that the prime minister has ruled out tax cuts for middle-income earners for the next decade, Cameron said that reducing the deficit and cutting taxes were not alternatives.Speaking in the Sichuan capital of Chengdu on the final day of his visit toChina, the prime minister told the BBC: \"The two aren't alternatives. It is possible to reduce people's taxes as your economy recovers. In April, there's going to be another significant tax cut as we complete the programme of allowing people to earn £10,000 before they pay anyincome tax at all. That's worth over £700 to the typical taxpayer.\" • Britain has won the right to export pig semen to China in a deal worth £45m a year. • The police officer at the centre of the Plebgate row that cost Andrew Mitchell his cabinet job is to sue the former chief whip for libel. As the Guardian reports, Toby Rowland, the officer on duty in Downing Street at the time of the altercation, insists Mitchell called him a pleb. Mitchell accused him of lying as part of his own libel appeal against the Sun. Now Rowland is to launch a libel action of his own against Mitchell. • The coalition is having to raid its school capital budget to find an extra £200m to build new school kitchens and fulfil its pledge to let all primary school children aged five-to seven-year-old receive a free school meal, a pledge announced by Nick Clegg at his party conference in September, it has emerged. As Patrick Wintour reports, In last-minute talks Whitehall sources said Clegg has been forced to raid either the schools maintenance budget or its basic needs budget to fund emergency construction and improvement of school kitchens to meet higher demand for school meals. The need to build extra kitchens had not been foreseen at the time of the initial £600m announcement. • The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, has agreed in principle to appear before the Commons home affairs committee to justify his claim that the Guardian has endangered national security by publishing leaks from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. • Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that Muslim chaplains are to be trained to challenge extremist Islamic views on university campuses as part of plans to prevent the spread of radical ideologies. As the Press Association reports, May said they would be used to prevent terrorist prisoners radicalising others while behind bars. She said the government was also looking at new orders to ban radical groups, including new civil powers to target individual extremists. In a written ministerial statement, she said there were plans to give the Charity Commission greater powers to stop the spread of hate-preaching. The proposals come after an extremist task force was set up to look at ways of stopping the spread of radical hate-preaching. • The Labour MP John Woodcock has declared that he is being treated for clinical depression. He has written an article about it. Because brilliant, inspiring people have had the courage to speak up and make the case that my latest ailment shouldn’t be treated any differently from these physical injuries, I am just going to come right out and say that I am clinically depressed. I went to see a doctor this week who prescribed me medication to relieve my black moods. • The House of Lords has said the second reading of James Wharton's backbench bill for an EU referendum will be held on Friday 10 January. Although it's sometimes hard to see what point PMQs serves, at the next election the electorate will have to make a choice between having David Cameron or Ed Miliband as prime minister and PMQs does at least allow a comparison. With Nick Clegg and Harriet Harman standing in for them, the occasion doesn't have the same edge and, frankly, today's exchanges were a political non-event. It wasn't that the two deputies were particularly bad; it's just that they didn't say anything remotely interesting or enlightening. But at least Harman was good humoured. The line about many Labour members being former Lib Dem ones sounded better in the chamber than it looks in print, and the line about even her knowing the difference between a brake and and accelerator was not exactly laugh-out-loud funny, but it was a rare example of a politician joking about their driving skills. (Harman does self-deprecation well; it is surprising that more politicians don't try it, because it works. Michael Gove is reputedly an appalling driver, but I've never heard him joke about it.) Harman also dealt with the claim that the coalition's bedroom tax policy was similar to a Labour one quite well. As for Clegg, he just rattled out the anti-Labour attack lines. It was a bit like @CCHQPress on speed. It was not subtle or endearing, but sometimes in politics it's important just to keep ploughing on, and he certainly did that. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says Clegg has been magnificent today. He has sounded like David Cameron. Can Clegg show he is really becoming Conservative by saying that he supports extending transitional controls on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants. Clegg says the government's position is that the freedom to travel is not the same as the freedom to claim. Labour's Gisela Stuart asks if Clegg thought the government got value for money with the sale of the Royal Mail. Yes, it did, says Clegg. John Baron, a Conservative, says the Lib Dems have a record of not delivering on EU referendums. Will Clegg ensure Lib Dem peers support James Wharton's bill, which is now in the Lords. Clegg says his party will stick to the position the government legislated for in 2011 - the referendum lock. Elfyn Llwyd, the Plaid Cyrmu MP, asks about a constituent who fled Italy with her son. She has been ordered to return. Does Clegg agree it would be wrong to take her into custody? Clegg says this is a desperately sad case. But ministers cannot comment on cases before the courts. He is sure the consulate in Italy will be able to help. Labour's Andrew Gwynne asks why more people are going to A&amp;E. Clegg accuses him of talking down the NHS. Average waiting times in A&amp;E have gone down, he says. Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, says actions speak louder than words. Does Clegg welcome the fact that Cameron is now in favour of Britain staying in the EU? Clegg says Kennedy is being mischievous. Labour's Nick Raynsford says a school in his constituency is being closed to make space for a free school. Clegg says Michael Gove will write to Raynsford about this. But Clegg says he favours schools being freed from the dead hand of bureaucracy. Bob Blackman, a Conservative, says rogue landlords should be criminalised. Clegg says plans were announced last year to help tenants get a better deal. Ann McKechin, the Labour MP, asks if the sale of the Royal Mail has obtained value for money for the taxpayer. Clegg says the price of Royal Mail shares was at the higher end of the range suggested by the government's advisers. David Nuttall, a Conservative, asks what the EU's share of world trade was in 1973, and what it is today. Clegg says the share today is about 20%. David Cameron has been advocated a China-EU trade deal. Shabana Mahmood, a Labour MP, says the government has been pushed into acting on business rates by Labour. Clegg says the only thing the government has been pushed into is rescuing the economy. Aidan Burley, a Conservative, asks Clegg to lower the benefits cap, or to regionalise it. Clegg says the government has not decided to regionalise it. It has been set at a level equivalent to earning £35,000 before tax. He would like to know if Labour now supports this. Labour's Phil Wilson asks Clegg if he agress that the Conservative party's hostility to the EU is bad for business. Clegg says pulling out of the EU would be an act of \"economic suicide\". David Heath, a Lib Dem, says waiting for superfast broadband in rural areas is like Waiting for Godot. Clegg says the roll-out of superfast broadband is accelerating. More plans will be set out shortly. Labour's Lucy Powell says a woman in full-time work has seen her earnings fall by £2,500 on average since the election. Will a tax break for married men help? Clegg says Powell knows there are different views on this in the coalition. Sir Alan Beith, a Lib Dem, asks about subsidies for onshore wind farms. Clegg says the Treasury will announce details of its plans shortly. The changes will make offshore wind more attractive to investors. PMQs Snap Verdict: Who won? Who cares? The B team showdown doesn't really count, and it showed. Harriet Harman had a couple of half-decent jokes, Clegg was drab but resilient, but the whole thing was pretty uninspiring. Harman says there is no comparison between what Labour did and what the coalition is doing. Labour only imposed its rules on new tenants. The Lib Dems say they are making a difference. That's true. Without them, there would be no bedroom tax. She says even she knows the difference between a brake and an accelerator. Isn't the best deputy a Conservative prime minister could have? Clegg says without the Lib Dem there would have been no recovery. The Lib Dems would not have had a City prawn cocktail offensive, like Labour. And they would not have broken the economy in the first place. Harman says Clegg will go to any lengths to be a loyal deputy to a Tory prime minister. If you want to freeze energy prices and scrap the bedroom tax, you have to vote Labour. Clegg says Labour are not even an opposition in waiting. They have no sensible policies. Why should anyone trust them to run the economy. Harman says Clegg has not admitted that bills are going up. Not one penny will come from the profits of the energy giants. The government is tip-toeing around the energy giants. When it comes to standing up to the powerful, the government is weak. But they penalise the weak. Last week David Cameron said the disabled are exempt from the bedroom tax. That's not true. Will Clegg apologise? Clegg says that, on the subject of weakness, this weak we discovered that Labour is not standing up to the unions. Labour should stand up to the unions. Harman says Clegg should leave it to Labour to worry about its members, especially as so many of them happen to be his former members. What should people affected by the bedroom tax do if they cannot move? Clegg says the coalition is applying the same rule that applied under Labour to the private sector. Harriet Harman asks if this winter's energy bills will be lower or higher than last year's. Clegg says they would be higher if the government had not acted as it has. Labour's policy is \"economically illiterate\". A Labour energy spokesperson said a few days ago you cannot control energy prices. That's an admission the policy is a \"con\". Harman says Clegg has \"ducked and dodged\". Household energy bills are going up, not down. The £50 measure is not enough to stop bills rising. How much of that will come from the profits of energy companies? Clegg says he did answer the question. Bills will be £50 lower than otherwise. Labour's policy is \"fantasy\". It's a \"fantasy freeze\". Clegg says overcrowding is a real problem. Labour has no answers to these problem. They have a \"bankruptcy of ideas\", he says. Labour's Julie Elliott asks about health cuts affecting Sunderland. Clegg says NHS England is making funding decisions. To have questions on NHS spending from a party that still does not support the coalition's support for extra funding of the NHS is unreasonable, he suggests. Nick Clegg says he is replying on behalf of David Cameron. There is a lot of jeering. The whole House will want to offer condolences to family and friends of those killed in the Glasgow helicopter crash, he says. He praises the emergency services. Nick Clegg is about to take PMQs. He will enjoy Alice Thomson in the Times today. She says Clegg and the Lib Dems may be unpopular, but they are becoming more confident and powerful in Whitehall (paywall). The bizarre paradox is that the more scandals they have overcome and the worse the Lib Dems do in the polls, the more confident their high command has become. They are likely to come fourth in next year’s European elections and a ccording to YouGov they have lost more than half their votes since the last election, going from 24 per cent to just 10. They could lose a dozen or more seats in 2015 but they seem more assured than the other parties ... The Lib Dems are also becoming more influential. Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, is presiding over a growing number of expensive wind farms and has protected most of the so-called green levies that are pushing up the cost of electricity. He only allowed the Chancellor to make a token £50 cut in energy bills — financed by higher taxes. Mr Clegg has become increasingly bold at bartering after his refusal to let Mr Cameron have his boundary changes. When the Tory leader insisted on a transferable tax allowance for married couples, Mr Clegg insisted that he receive the same amount of money to increase free school meals for infants. “Totally bonkers and counter to everything the coalition stands for but we had to swallow it,” said a Downing Street aide. Last week Mr Clegg announced new plans for shared parental leave for up to a year, again angering Tories. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. And here are four articles I found particularly interesting. • Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun says George Osborne will scrap national insurance for workers under 21 in the autumn statement tomorrow. All jobs tax for the under 21s will be abolished this week as the centre piece of a major package to tackle the youth unemployment crisis, The Sun can reveal. George Osborne will scrap employers’ national insurance contributions for every worker aged 20 or under in his mini budget on Thursday. • The Financial Times (subscription) says senior Tories have attacked Alistair Darling's \"comatose\" leadership of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence. Alistair Darling has been dubbed “comatose” by senior Conservatives, amid signs of growing frustration in Downing Street over the former Labour chancellor’s leadership of the “Better Together” Scottish campaign. With just 10 months to go before the referendum on Scotland’s independence, the Tory top command is growing increasingly concerned that Mr Darling is not pressing the case for the union hard enough. “The man has never run a campaign,” said one very senior Tory figure. “He is comatose most of the time.” One Downing Street source described Mr Darling as a “dreary figurehead” for such an important campaign. • Mariana Campeanu, the Romanian labour minister, tells the Times in an interview (paywall) that Romanians and Bulgarians should be welcomed with open arms for doing jobs shunned by British workers who would rather live off the welfare state. “I do not know in depth the British social welfare system, this is an internal issue of the British Government how generous it can be in its welfare system towards its citizens,” Mrs Campeanu said in an interview in Bucharest. “This should maybe be a reason why many British people do not access the vacancies on the labour market for which Romanian citizens, for example, are going to apply. If there are any vacancies, somebody will fill them, whether they are from Romania, Italy, Spain or wherever\" ... “Taking into account the fact that Romanian citizens in the UK contribute greatly to the GDP and also that many of these people are young and well-qualified, the UK should be grateful that these people have come to live there,” Mrs Campeanu said. • Gavin Kelly in the Financial Times (subscription) says the autumn statement is likely to show that household debt has risen above £2 trillion. If a frothy housing market means rates start to climb before wages have recovered their mojo, things could get nasty. Should, say, rates climb towards 4 per cent by the middle of the next parliament – roughly 1 per cent higher than the markets expect but still lower than the long-term norm – about 1.2m households would be spending more than half of their income on repayments – a perilous amount. Nearly 6m would be paying more than 25 per cent. A gentler path would have rates staying low for some years, allowing wages to recover and households to adjust. So, while it is encouraging that the BoE looks willing to use its wider regulatory powers to avoid having to raise rates prematurely, on its own this may not suffice. As a final act in the crisis, we may still need aggressive debt restructuring to secure the position of today’s vulnerable but viable borrowers. Regardless of whether unemployment has fallen below the BoE’s key threshold of 7 per cent, it should be made clear that interest rates are unlikely to rise until real wages and incomes are buoyant. For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 40% (up 2 points from YouGov yesterday) Conservatives: 32% (no change) Ukip: 12% (no change) Lib Dems: 9% (down 1) Labour lead: 8 points (up 2) Government approval: -27 (up 3) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 104. Sky News has a scoop. PC Toby Rowland, the officer on duty at the gates of Number 10 who had an exchange with Andrew Mitchell, is going to sue Andrew Mitchell for libel. At a press conference last week Mitchell accused Rowland of not telling the truth. On Sky, Martin Brunt says he thinks the Police Federation may fund Rowland's libel action. The Treasury is briefing today that George Osborne will cap business rates in tomorrow's autumn statement. According to the BBC, business rates in England and Wales will go up 2% next year, instead of 3.2% as planned. This revelation seems to have been timed to coincided with today's opposition day debate. Labour has tabled a motion saying the government should \"take action to ease the burden of business rates\". Toby Perkins, the shadow minister for small business, says Osborne's plan does not go far enough. The government has been pushed into action on business rates by Labour after Ed Miliband's call for a cut. But today's announcement falls far short of what firms suffering from the cost-of-living crisis have been crying out for. Business rates are employers' number-one complaint about costs and, as with the government's announcement on energy prices, firms will still face rising bills. Business rates will still rise by an average of over £250 in April, on top of £1,500 so far under David Cameron. By contrast, under Labour's plan, 1.5 million start-ups, workshops and shops would benefit from a cut and then a freeze in business rates. At Labour's conference Ed Miliband said the party would cancel a planned cut in corporation tax (which would have helped large firms), and instead use the savings to cut business rates for small firms. Here's some reaction to the national infrastructure plan announcement. From Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury With the country facing a cost-of-living crisis we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs, boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long-term. But for the last three-and-a-half years the Government’s record on infrastructure has been one of complete failure. The ONS says that infrastructure work is down 3.7 per cent in the last year and fell by 10 per cent in 2012. And in the spending review the Government set out plans to cut capital investment even further in real terms in 2015/16. Scheme after scheme has been announced to great fanfare but then little actually delivered. Yet another announcement from Ministers about possible future investment will do little to reassure business that warm words will finally translate into diggers in the ground. From Nick Baveystock, director of the Institution of Civil Engineers The National Infrastructure Plan plays a critical role in enabling the UK to compete in a modern world, creating jobs and growth and providing the stability for the UK to grow its engineering skills and capacity. Previous editions of the Plan have set out a much needed and welcome vision for infrastructure, but the need for it to evolve into a robust delivery plan - aligned with the UK’s strategic goals – has become more pressing. The new 2013 Plan, with its updated pipeline of projects, further £25bn investment and evidence of a shift to “delivery mode”, is a positive step and presents us with an opportunity to drive this agenda forward. From Nick Prior, head of infrastructure at Deloitte, the consultancy firm The additional infrastructure funding announced by the Chief Secretary today is welcome but we need much clearer sight of where this money will actually be spent. The government guarantees scheme is making a difference. This has been the most impactful announcement on infrastructure to date. But, the reality is, little of this money will be spent this side of 2015, so we won’t see shovels in the ground on new projects for some time. The £25bn commitment from insurers is good news in demonstrating the attractiveness of UK infrastructure to investors. But they still need to see a clear pipeline of opportunities to put their money into and this will require some upfront commitment and ongoing funding from government. The intention is there but the funding is still aspirational. From Mat Riley, head of infrastructure at EC Harris, a built asset consultancy Today’s revised infrastructure spending programme is, again, strong on headlines, but unclear on delivery. The government is working hard to attract investors such as the insurance funds, but the UK still does not have the right policy environment for these funds to be put to good use and make a real difference, which is compounding the problem. Who would want to take the risk and invest in a nation that cannot even put together a coherent energy policy without fear of ridicule? Regulation is largely ineffective, and the balance of power now sits with asset owners and their investors, which means only one outcome for the consumer, and that is higher costs. Politicians are in denial, the real issue is how much cost consumers are ultimately going to bear, and by when. From Phil Blythe, chair of the Institution of Engineering and Technology's transport policy panel, on the plans to cancel the plan to fund the A14 road scheme from tolling This was always going to happen as they set the toll so low that whoever built the road and toll infrastructure would never recover their investment. What is needed is a network of such roads around the UK, to share the cost and the back office to make this feasible. In general, we support the idea of allowing private companies to build additional lanes on existing roads and recover the costs through tolls. We have to make the proposition attractive for investors. Technology is not an issue and the UK has a major pool of expertise in this area. The Treasury has now published its 152-page national infrastructure plan (pdf). And here's the Treasury news release about it. Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, has announced that he will issue advice to people using Twitter, Facebook and other social media to help them to posting comments that are in contempt of court. In practice, this means that the advisory notes that he sends out to media organisations will now be published, on his website and on his Twitter feed. There are more details here, in this news release. In an interview for BBC News, Grieve suggested that children should be taught about the dangers of tweeting on matters that are sub judice at school. We might want to look at what we do in schools, because after all children starting tweeting very young. So it may be that it’s something where we need to provide a bit of education explaining that you have responsibilities. Each one of us always has a responsibility when we say anything, but the difference is that what previously was a private conversation between two or three people, which would have had no impact on the trial, if it goes viral, then it may reach hundreds of thousands of people, and then at that stage people will start saying that the fairness of the trial process is being endangered. He also said that the best advice was just not to tweet about live court cases at all. It’s the best advice I can give: if there’s a live case, people should not be making public comment about it. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been touring the broadcast studios this morning to speak about his national infrastructure plan. Here are the main points he's been making. • Alexander has confirmed that subsidies for onshore wind farms and solar power are being cut. But they are only being reduced \"slightly\", he said. And subsidies for offshore wind are being increased. Within the total envelope of money that we are able to make available to energy suppliers, we have looked in detail at how much it costs to do offshore windfarms and onshore windfarms and big solar schemes and we are reducing slightly the subsidy we are providing to onshore wind and to these big solar schemes because we think that's the best way to get value for money for the electricity consumer. We should be doing so in the most cost-effective way we can and we should also be making sure that industries where the UK has a vast potential, like offshore wind, get the support they need really to take off. With the strike prices for offshore wind today that we are setting out, that will also I think enable, on DECC's (Department of Energy and Climate Change) analysis, at least 10 gigawatts of offshore wind between now and 2020. I hope that is also a big vote of confidence from the Government in that sector. Alexander also rejected a suggestion that the move was inspired by political opposition to onshore windfarms. • He said that the government had created \"an environment, in which people want to come and invest in UK infrastructure\". He was particularly pleased that six major insurers were announcing that they were going to invest £25bn in UK infrastracture of the next five years, he said. Those firms are: Legal and General, Prudential, Aviva, Standard Life, Friends Life and Scottish Widows. • He said total investment in infrastructure was higher than under Labour. We’re publishing figures today that show that overall investment in UK infrastructure in this parliament has gone up to about £45bn a year compared to £41bn a year in the last parliament. Those figures combine public investment and private investment, he said. • He said that, according to the Nabarro Infrastructure Investment Index, the UK was the best place in the world to invest in infrastructure now. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and from PoliticsHome. And here's a Danny Alexander quote from the Treasury press release. The announcement today that six major insurers will invest £25 billion over the next five years is a massive vote of confidence in the UK economy. It supports the wider £100 billion public investment to rebuild Britain over the next seven years that I announced at the Spending Round 2013. Underground, overground, on shore, offshore, wired or wireless, tarmac or train track. You name it, we’re building it right now. I fear that final sentence may be a hostage to fortune. What about that new runway or airport in the south east? Or HS2? Or those new towns Nick Clegg has been talking about? Here's an extract from the Treasury's press release about the national infrastructure plan. The government will tomorrow publish a new National Infrastructure Plan (NIP) containing a pipeline of over £375 billion of planned public and private sector energy, transport, flood defence, waste, water and communications infrastructure up to 2030 and beyond. It comes on the day that six major insurers announced plans to collectively invest £25 billion in UK infrastructure over the next five years. Much of this investment could go into the pipeline projects published today. The decision follows the successful negotiation last week by UK government of the key European directive Solvency II. The UK negotiations ensured those capital rules incentivised life insurers to invest in a wider range of assets including infrastructure projects which can deliver the consistent long term returns these businesses seek. The National Infrastructure Plan published today provides the visibility and improved certainty industry has been looking for to commit to big investments. The Infrastructure Pipeline published alongside the plan is the most comprehensive overview of planned and potential UK infrastructure investment ever produced. And here, from the press release, is a summary of the announcements in the plan. The government will: • sign an agreement with Hitachi and Horizon to support the financing of the development of a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in North Wales through a UK guarantee, subject to final due diligence and ministerial approval • provide a further £50 million for a full redevelopment of the railway station at Gatwick Airport • take forward steps to convert public sector car fleets to electric vehicles investing £5 million in a pilot during 2014-15 • fund improvements to the A50 around Uttoxeter starting no later than 2015/16 • confirm that there will be no tolling on the planned A14 scheme between Cambridge and Huntingdon, construction of which is planned to start in 2016 • confirm that a UK guarantee has now been agreed for the £1 billion Northern Line extension to Battersea, unlocking a development the size of the Olympics in the Nine Elms area • announce a £8.8 million guarantee for new energy efficient lighting systems across NCP car parks in the UK • create a new court for infrastructure to avoid unnecessary delays in the planning process for major projects • confirm strike prices for renewable energy, so that energy providers know how much they will receive for electricity generated in the future • open a £10 million competitive fund in early 2014 to test innovative solutions to deliver superfast broadband services to the most difficult to reach areas of the UK. Options may include enhanced mobile services, new fixed technologies and alternative approaches to structuring financial support, working closely with the communications industry • build on the Spending Round commitment of £2.3 billion capital investment for flood defences by developing a new long-term plan, including naming key projects by Autumn Statement 2014 • The target for the sale of corporate and financial assets will be doubled from £10 billion to £20 billion between 2014 and 2020, including the Government’s shareholding in Eurostar • The government will also look at options to bring private capital into the Green Investment Bank to enable it to operate more freely in delivering its objectives There's a strong Lib Dem flavour to political events today. With David Cameron still in China, Nick Clegg is taking PMQs. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is announcing (or re-announcing - this builds on something he has announced before) a national infrastructure plan. And we may even hear from Ed Davey too. According to the BBC, the government is going to announce big changes to the way it subsidises renewable energy. The government is to make big changes to the way it subsidises renewable energy, the BBC has learned. Ministers will announce that they will cut support for onshore wind and solar energy, but give more backing to offshore wind power. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander described the shift in subsidy as \"a rebalancing\" and said overall spending would not change. But Labour said \"chopping and changing\" pricing was bad for business. The set prices for onshore wind power and solar energy will be cut from 2015, while those for offshore wind power will be increased. I'll be covering all these stories, and anything else that crops up. Here's the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee on crime reduction policies. 10am: Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Lord Deighton, the commercial secretary to the Treasury, launch the national infrastructure plan. As Rowena Mason reports, Alexander will say that Britain's stake in the cross-channel rail operator Eurostar will be sold off under a new £10bn privatisation programme. 10.30am: Rhodri Morgan, the former Welsh first minister, and Lord McConnell, the former Scottish first minister, and former cabinet secretaries Lord O'Donnell and Lord Butler give evidence to a Lords committee looking at the coalition government. 12pm: Nick Clegg takes PMQs. Alexander has been giving interviews about his infrastructure plan this morning. I will summarise the key points shortly. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon.

Long pieces of wood stick out of four of the stoves, with the flames shooting up, while charcoal heats up in the other one. Smoke fills the test area for the first 15 minutes at least. The stoves are lit twice daily to replicate everyday use as they are tested for durability. The scene is being played out at the headquarters of Prakti, the company founded by Serrar, once a high-flying executive for Motorola in San Francisco, who chucked in the good life to design cookstoves for developing countries. Headquarters is a bit of a misnomer. Prakti's employees work out of converted red-brick kiln houses in rural Auroville in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Auroville is home to 2,000 people from 30 countries who arrived in the 1960s to set up an \"international township\" that would transcend class, nationality and creed. Pragmatists as well as idealists, they experimented in solar energy and organic farming. In the process, they turned Auroville into a magnet for tourists who come to gaze at Matrimandir (Sanskrit for temple of the mother). \"It makes sense to be [in India] to be close to the users of the stoves who provide us with a quick reality check on what we do. Auroville is an interesting place for innovation and conducive to new ideas,\" says Minh Cuong Le Quan, Prakti's chief operating officer, minding the shop while Serrar was on a cruise for entrepreneurs, stopping in South Africa, Vietnam and India. According to Le Quan, an agricultural engineer by training, Serrar was the first person to apply industrial design skills to the humble cookstove, where companies such as Envirofit and StoveTec are established players. There is certainly a need for affordable, clean stoves. Estimates published by the Lancet in December put the number of global deaths from indoor air pollution from cooking at 4 million, double previous estimates. Each day, about 3 billion people cook and heat their homes using open fires and inefficient stoves that burn solid fuels such as wood, animal dung, agricultural residues, charcoal and coal. As a result, 3.5 million deaths are directly associated with indoor pollution each year. Another 500,000 deaths, mostly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are caused by outdoor air pollution from cooking. Indoor air pollution is a bigger killer than malaria or tuberculosis. In 2010, Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, launched the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, a public-private partnership to create a market for clean stoves and to promote the adoption of 100m clean stoves by 2020. The alliance is holding a forum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 18 March. Serrar, who is of Moroccan origin, put $500,000 into Prakti, and has spent the past few years designing models. He believes there is no one solution that fits all needs as people from different parts of the world require stoves for different-sized pots. Some people cook standing up, others sitting down. Some inside, some outside. So the stoves have to be adapted to local requirements and cultures. Prakti does not mass produce stoves. Serrar will send one of his colleagues, equipped with a few samples, to discuss the needs of potential buyers, based on cooking habits and the viability of providing spares. In all, Prakti has sold 8,000 stoves, a tiny amount for a potentially huge market. Collectively, stove companies have reached less than 1% of the market. Prakti's stoves may be more efficient and less polluting – it is the only cookstove company to offer a one-year warranty – but they are expensive. In India a Prakti wood stove costs 1,000 rupees (£12). That compares with a traditional clay chulha costing 100 rupees. The chulha carries hidden medical costs, as household members fall ill from indoor pollution, but the upfront price of Prakti stoves is a big deterrent Users also have to be reminded that the stainless steel and cast iron stoves are susceptible to rust. Serrar, however, is confident in his products. \"Once we have a stove with value, we can always find a market,\" he said. \"Poor people are today paying a lot using traditional stoves. In Haiti, a family can spend as much as a third of their income on fuel for cooking … A Prakti stove retails for $50 but saves them $250 per year, for five years.\" The next phase for Prakti is to bring costs down, particularly distribution costs for the \"last mile\". The stoves may be ingeniously designed and efficient but, unless poor people can afford them, Prakti will not make the health and environmental impact Serrar seeks. With this in mind, Prakti is seeking commercial partners who may be able to cut distribution costs. He also wants to work with microfinancing institutions to extend loans for stoves. Prakti intends to ship parts for assembly in countries of sale and eventually to have manufacturing done on the spot, since Serrar is keen to promote local jobs. \"Local production and job creation make us a much appreciated partner with local communities and local governments globally,\" said Serrar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/may/24/solar-plane-first-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-24T13:21:58Z","webTitle":"Solar plane begins first flight from Europe to Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/24/solar-plane-first-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/may/24/solar-plane-first-flight","fields":{"headline":"Solar plane begins first flight from Europe to Africa","bodyText":"An experimental solar-powered airplane took off from Switzerland on its first transcontinental flight on Thursday, aiming to reach North Africa next week. Pilot Andre Borschberg will fly the jumbo jet-size Solar Impulse plane on its first leg to Madrid, Spain, by Friday. His colleague Bertrand Piccard will take the helm of the aircraft for the second stretch of its 1,554mile journey to the Moroccan capital Rabat. Fog on the runaway at its home base in Payerne, Switzerland, delayed the take off by two hours, demonstrating how susceptible the prototype single-seater aircraft is to adverse weather. \"We can't fly into clouds because it was not designed for that,\" Borschberg said as he piloted the plane with its 63meter (207ft) wingspan towards the French city of Lyon at a cruising speed of just 43.5mph. Before landing in Madrid in the early hours of Friday, Borschberg will face other challenges, including having to fly over the Pyrenees mountains that separate France and Spain. He has a parachute inside his tiny cabin that he hopes never to use. Piccard – the son of an undersea explorer Jacques Piccard and grandson of balloonist Auguste Piccard – will have to cross the windy Straits of Gibraltar from Europe to Africa. The team has been invited to Morocco by the country's King Mohammed VI to showcase the cutting edge of solar technology. Morocco is about to start construction on a massive solar energy plant at Ouarzazate, part of a country-wide solar energy grid with a capacity of 2000MW by 2020. The solar flight is described as a trial for a round-the-world flight with a new aircraft in 2014. That trip will include stops in the US, said Borschberg. In 2010, the Swiss flew non-stop for 26-hour to demonstrate that the 12,000 solar cells attached to the aircraft can soak up enough sunlight to keep the plane airborne through the night. A year later, he took Solar Impulse on its first international flight to Belgium and France. The project began in 2003 and is estimated to cost about $100m (£67m) over 10 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/jun/02/labour-peers-stripped-whip-lobbying-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-02T13:55:00Z","webTitle":"Labour peers stripped of party whip over lobbying allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/02/labour-peers-stripped-whip-lobbying-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/jun/02/labour-peers-stripped-whip-lobbying-claims","fields":{"headline":"Labour peers stripped of party whip over lobbying allegations","bodyText":"Three peers have stood down from their parliamentary parties pending inquiries into allegations they broke rules by offering to carry out parliamentary work for cash. Lord Cunningham and Lord Mackenzie were suspended by Labour and the Ulster Unionist Lord Laird resigned over allegations they offered to work with undercover journalists posing as lobbyists. All three deny any wrongdoing and have referred themselves to the House of Lords commissioner for standards. The developments, which come days after the MP Patrick Mercer resigned the Tory whip after being stung by undercover reporters, will increase pressure on the parliamentary authorities and David Cameron to introduce new rules governing lobbying. At present, Lords rules ban peers from seeking to profit from membership of the House of Lords by offering parliamentary advice or services. But the government has shied away from pledges to introduce laws that would shine further light on the lobbying industry. Cunningham, who was a Labour cabinet minister before he was awarded a peerage in 2005, is alleged to have offered to write directly to the prime minister to push an agenda by lobbyists who were actually undercover Sunday Times reporters. He asked for £144,000 a year for lobbying services, according to the newspaper, and was recorded telling reporters posing as representatives of a South Korean solar energy company that he would become their advocate in Westminster. \"Knocking on doors, introductions and getting to see the people, including if necessary the ministers – this is part of the package,\" he allegedly said. In response, Cunningham said he had been testing his suspicions that he was being targeted by a scam when he met the undercover reporters. \"The Sunday Times story contains a highly sensationalist and misleading account of one meeting with journalists posing as business people,\" he said in a statement. \"I quickly became suspicious of them and the money they were offering and sought to test my suspicions during the meeting. \"What the article does not make at all clear is that I told the undercover journalists that I always stick to the rules and declare any interests. \"The article also fails to properly acknowledge the important fact that I informed them the next day that I wanted nothing more to do with them. \"That same day I notified Baroness Royall, the Labour Leader in the House of Lords, and Lord Bassam, the chief whip, of my suspicions and what had occurred. I also reported to the clerk of the parliaments and the registrar of members' interests,\" he said. Mackenzie, Tony Blair's former law and order adviser, was accused of setting up a ruse that allowed him to host events for paying clients, including on the terrace. The Sunday Times said that during the sham interview the peer was asked whether he could get around parliamentary rules that stop peers from booking events related to their financial interests. Mackenzie replied by saying that it was within the rules to ask someone else to host a party if it was for charitable causes. Defending his actions, Mackenzie told Sky's Murnaghan programme that the rules may have to be tightened up and that he would be vindicated by an investigation. \"Morally it may well look as though it's not right but to hold the function that's the only way you could do it,\" he said. \"I thought it was all right because it was a non-profit-making function, it was to do with saving energy, so it was important. \"I have an interest in the energy field. There was a minister speaking so it was important that the function went ahead and that was the only way we could do it and it was within the rules.\" He went on: \"What I have done is referred it to the Lords commissioner who looks at standards in the House of Lords and he will independently have a look at what the rules are and what I've done and I'm quite convinced that I shall be vindicated. \"It's a very complex area, but I made sure I knew the rules before I went into any of this and it's an important thing to do obviously because what we don't want is parliamentarians breaking the rules. But there may well be a case for changing them.\" On Sunday Labour withdrew the party whip from both peers, pending an inquiry. A Labour spokesperson said: \"Lord Cunningham and Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate have been suspended from the Labour party pending further investigation. The Labour party expects the highest standards of its representatives and believes that they have a duty to be transparent and accountable at all times.\" Laird was involved in two separate stings this weekend – one by the BBC's Panorama and another by the Sunday Times. Justine Greening, the minister for international development, said the rules of lobbying would have to be re-examined: \"With the cases that have come to light over the weekend, it looks as if [the peers] may have broken the rules … But I think we also need to look at whether we can go further than that and be better and clearer about what constitutes fairer lobbying and when it goes beyond the right line,\" she told Murnaghan. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that if rules had been broken it was for Labour's chief whip to take action and he would be encouraging her to do so. The shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, said the latest claims were \"a new low for British politics\" and voters would rightly be \"sickened\". A recall power was needed for MPs guilty of \"serious financial misbehaviour that brings politics, parliament and the process into disrepute\", he said. Mercer said he was taking legal advice but had resigned the whip to save his party embarrassment, and would step down from the Commons at the next general election. He also referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. The MPs' code of conduct prohibits paid advocacy and requires the declaration of financial interests. The Tory MP for Monmouth, David Davies, said he was among those targeted by the Panorama sting but had refused the offer of lobbying work. Cunningham, who was an MP for 22 years and served in Tony Blair's cabinet, said he had been testing his suspicions that he was being targeted by a scam. \"The Sunday Times story contains a highly sensationalist and misleading account of one meeting with journalists posing as business people,\" he said in a statement. \"I quickly became suspicious of them and the money they were offering and sought to test my suspicions during the meeting. \"What the article does not make at all clear is that I told the undercover journalists that I always stick to the rules and declare any interests. \"The article also fails to properly acknowledge the important fact that I informed them the next day that I wanted nothing more to do with them. \"That same day I notified Baroness Royall, the Labour Leader in the House of Lords and Lord Bassam, the Chief Whip, of my suspicions and what had occurred.

Many companies have achieved their first generation environment goals and are becoming bolder about their next steps. Companies from the Fortune 100 and S&amp;P Global 100 are investing billions in renewable energy procurement to manage price volatility, and there is nearly half a billion square feet of commercial space around the world that is certified 'green' by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Leed) programme. Some companies are shifting into high gear. Walmart, for example, has pledged to become 100% powered by renewable energy and to eliminate its waste stream. This progress is increasingly driven by a hard-nosed concern for the bottom line. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, business leaders named climate change and water risk as two of the top four global risks. In 2012, extreme weather events caused more than $200bn (£132bn) in damages globally. But most companies still face a range of barriers in bringing sustainability into long-term decision-making. Within companies, many sustainability officers are not fully empowered and seen as a separate department rather than a critical component of financial and overall business decisions. When it comes to internal capital investment decisions, most companies are systematically underestimating environmental risks. Credible, comparable sustainability metrics are not being sufficiently utilised to fully understand the costs of environmental risks. The good news is that these barriers can be overcome and a growing number of companies are showing us how. Aligning profit and environmental sustainability: stories from industry, a paper published by the World Resources Institute (WRI), looks at the barriers that seven major companies have faced in developing their environmental sustainability programs. These cases provide valuable lessons about the type of creative, forward-looking strategies needed to make corporate sustainability initiatives have real impact. Incentivise sustainability Too often, companies' sustainability initiatives operate in silos, removed from value creation and financial decisions. One company that is having more success integrating sustainability into its decision-making chain is Alcoa, a global leader in aluminium. The company has set long-term goals to improve environmental performance for carbon dioxide emissions, energy, waste, and water. Alcoa links up to 20% of compensation for its senior employees – from production managers to chief executive – to achieving these goals. It's also invested R&amp;D into products that reduce fuel use and other costs, a \"win-win\" strategy that reduces emissions and improves the company's competitiveness. Empower your corporate sustainability officer While sustainability has been discussed in the C-suite for several years, sustainability executives often lack the authority to influence key decisions in business units. Because sustainability teams measure success differently than financial teams, it can be hard to make the case to prioritise environmental initiatives. AkzoNobel, the world's largest paint and coatings company, is taking a different approach. It has created \"eco-premium solutions\", such as paints that reflect solar energy to keep homes cool. The company expects a 30% revenue share from this product line by 2015. Furthermore, both the CSO and company controller sign off on capital budget requests that exceed $5m (£3.3m). This empowers the CSO to drive collaboration between sustainability and financial teams, growing the business while reducing environmental impacts. Manage 'integrated' capital allocation Most companies look at traditional financial criteria when considering capital expenditures. But incorporating sustainability challenges into these assessments can bring direct financial gains. Smart CSOs equipped with serious diagnostic tools can uncover opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce exposure to shocks, such as those related to energy price volatility and water risks. Johnson &amp; Johnson, the multinational, health products giant, has implemented a flexible budget to encourage investment in sustainability projects. By increasing capital for greenhouse-gas reduction initiatives like solar installations, the company saves money through reduced energy costs. It can then use these savings to help finance similar projects. The company also reduced the rate of return required for these emissions-reduction projects to reflect their lower risk. This is helping the company reach its greenhouse gas reduction goals, while the projects themselves are showing an average return around 19%. Command the data To be successful, sustainability officers must be able to \"sell\" their projects to colleagues, senior executives, and investors. This, of course, requires high-quality metrics, including accounting for external environmental costs, like the societal impacts of pollution or the cost of cleaning tainted water for industrial use. Companies without metrics for these factors may overlook serious risks or make inaccurate assumptions about investment costs. One company actively utilising environmental metrics is Natura, the Brazil-based, multinational cosmetics company. The company works with its suppliers to track and price externalities like carbon dioxide emissions, water use, and waste generation. Natura, in turn, uses a \"shadow price\" for these factors to select suppliers with the lightest footprint, which will also create financial benefits. A new breed of management techniques The real leaders of change are the ones with the foresight to understand that managing the risks and uses of natural resources really matters. As Warren Buffet once said: \"Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\" It's encouraging to see that some companies are already recognising that managing and mitigating environmental risks can help cut costs and expand their profits. But protecting the planet and boosting bottom lines will require huge efforts. More companies need to get on board by rethinking traditional management techniques and fully integrating sustainability into their core business operations.

In fact I think paper bins in classrooms have become pretty standard practice. This is great, but at our school we take pride in taking this to another level. We don't want pupils to recycle or flick off a switch just out of routine or habit; we want them to understand why it's important and to feel inspired and proud to be taking action that makes our school a greener place. We've discovered that these actions mean so much more when engaged within the classroom and that they present some really exciting topics to investigate, especially when looked at within a global dimension. I worked with Kathy Hill, the education manager from SolarAid and a few other teachers, to design some resources that would help schools teach about climate change, energy and renewables. These developed into the Sunny Schools lesson plans which break down these issues to make them accessible at KS2 level and provide links to online activities, videos or practical ideas for how to bring them to life in the classroom. For example our classes have designed eco-houses in design and technology, made solar circuits in science, calculated their energy use in maths, conducted surveys and taken part in a debate about climate change opinions in literacy. The teachers at our school have loved using these resources in the classroom. They are teacher-friendly and give all teachers the confidence and support to take on a subject which may be new to them. I like the picture above especially. It is an image of the world at night that produces awe and wonder from pupils when we examine, with atlases, which places in the world had the lights on at night, and which others remained in darkness without electricity. SolarAid works with solar power in Africa. The fifth unit of the Sunny Schools resources, solar around the world, uses case studies and pictures to teach what life is like without electricity for children all over the planet. This global perspective was what got the pupils really excited, particularly when SolarAid lent us some of the solar lights they sell in Africa to let the children take home. These were the very same lights that children in Africa use to do their homework and are the new alternative to dangerous kerosene lamps that are traditionally used. We challenged our own pupils to do their reading homework by solar light and to write some diary entries comparing the experience to their usual routine. One of our year 6 boys told us how the solar light helped him and a friend to help their neighbour find a lost cat in the dark. Learning about the wonders of science in this context was a really exciting way to study electricity. Climate change can seem like a daunting topic, and energy saving might sometimes seem more of a drag than an inspiration for the classroom, but it has the potential to transform behaviour and be of genuine interest. Our teachers have noticed the difference tremendously in their own classes, with pupils approaching them with newspaper articles or something they've seen on the telly that relates to climate change or global awareness. Not only that but they're using new vocabulary fluently and thinking about how their actions at home and local school community is affecting the world globally. Jack, a year 6 pupil, now tells me how he convinced his sister, Ruby, to walk to school every day now because it reduces their carbon footprint. Our pupils are making links beyond the classroom and that is exactly how education should be.

What's left for Brian Cox? Ah, Wonders of Life (BBC2), that's what. And in this first one he's asking: what is life? Pah! When's he going to take on some serious issues, not these silly trivialities, this idle gossip? Right, then. Here's a dragonfly, a live one. But what makes it alive? Well it can pull 2.5 G-force in a turn, beat its wings 50 times a second, fly at 15 miles an hour … he likes a number, does Prof Cox. But these are piffling, two-figure numbers. I want big numbers from him, ending in illion. Give me zeros baby, lots of them. Here we go – 13.7 BILLION years ago, that's better. I remember that one from last time; it's when the universe was formed. And every single joule of energy around today was present then, because of the first law of thermodynamics, obviously. And here's another massive one coming : 120 BILLION (nice!) cubic metres of rock and ash, which is what this Filipino volcano blew away, and what's blowing me away now too. Hang on, though. How did we get from the dragonfly to here? Well, the dragonfly got us thinking about what makes something alive, and how life began in the first place. Then we went to the Philippines to meet these people who believe in spirits and the dead, which is obviously wrong; life – as Schrödinger said – isn't something mystical, it's the interaction of matter and energy as described by the laws of science. But Prof Brian isn't all snooty and dismissive of the spirit people; he's a nice, understanding, smiley scientist, not an angry one like Richard Dawkins. To a waterfall, then, because Brian looks lovely in front of falling water … no, because it's a good place to have a conversation about the conservation of energy. Then on to the big crater, because it's good for illustrating proton gradients, which, it turns out, are absolutely crucial to everything. He bangs on and on about these bloody proton gradients, the protons cascading down the waterfall (not a real one now, confusingly, but a metaphorical one), from the proton reservoir to the proton deficit … OK, I get it Brian. They're really important, the source of energy for life, and probably how life began, from vents in a primordial ocean. Here's Brian himself in the sea, swimming with a host of golden jellyfish, 20 MILLION of them. And that's to do with harvesting solar energy, via embedded algae, which fits into the big story … bugger, lost it again (hits pause to ponder, then rewind). I have to do that quite a lot: stop and recap. Because though I think I understand what he's on about right now (thermodynamics, DNA, an orang utan's three-BILLION letter genetic code, etc), I've completely forgotten how the hell it all fits in to the big picture, or what the big picture is even of. Life, that's it – not a thing, but a series of chemical processes that harness the flow of energy to create islands of order, like a tree, or me. To be honest you don't need to understand it all. You can just go along for the view if you want, while a gentle Lancashire lilt washes over you like the ripples lapping the shore of that volcanic lake. What is he talking about? Who knows, but it's lovely. Now go on, give us one of your big numbers. The view is of Coxy himself a lot of the time. Well, he is a very well ordered island, with a very big smile, the Smile of Wonder. And he works well in front of a whole lot of different backdrops. Just there, Brian, perfect, with a raging torrent behind; or in a wetsuit, good. Now gazing out, over majestic panoramas, contemplative, thinking big thoughts, thoughts with lots of zeros after them. But most of all he's silhouetted, in front of a low sun, framed by a circular lens reflection, like a halo, godlike almost. Are we absolutely sure life didn't begin, in the beginning, when Brian created it? Natural World: Kangaroo Dundee (BBC2) was charming, about a man called Brolga who rescues baby kangaroos. What happens is that when Jills (Sheilas, only kangaroos) get run over they can act like sort of marsupial airbags to their young, which survive in the pouch. A Joey needs a mum though. That's where Brolga comes in; he becomes their mum. I don't love kangaroos. The way they move is stupid. Plus the pouch thing upsets me – too Alien (and doesn't it get smelly in there?). It's a nice story, though, beautifully shot.

That means we need both nuclear and renewables.\" Today this is changing. Lobbyists for big energy roam Whitehall talking renewables down at best, and trying to shoot down government support for them at worst. As for the other side, the editor of the premier solar industry trade journal, Michael Schmela of Photon, recently wrote the following portentous words: \"The fact is that base load plants and solar can't peacefully coexist.\" Why such a gloomy view of intra energy industry relationships? In a sensible world, shouldn't we all be working together to fashion a future based on a broad range of technologies? Just as we needed both Spitfires and Lancasters when mobilising in 1940, shouldn't we be mobilising both centralised and decentralised power today? The reason for Schlema's pessimism derives from the spectacular growth of the German solar photovoltaics (PV) industry since the government introduced a so called feed-in tariff. This involves premium pricing for solar electricity, funded by a small levy on all electricity bills. It will be reduced as increased production of solar energy reduces its cost, and offset by tax income from the newly created industry. Last year, Germany installed 3.9 gigawatts of PV as a result of its feed-in tariff, and the figure for this year looks like being 10 gigawatts. Although the cumulative total of installed PV is still only 15 gigawatts, contributing some 3% of Germany's annual electricity output, solar electricity is already shaving the national midday peak in electricity consumption. Importantly, in the deregulated German market the pricing of electricity is predicated on the size of the midday peak: the higher the peak, the higher the prices. In other words, even small amounts of solar in the mix – which does some social good in cutting prices – affects the profitability of the big energy companies like Eon and RWE. This is turn impacts, among other things, on their ability to invest in new centralised power plants. This week in the UK, as the government's comprehensive spending review was published, the British solar industry narrowly escaped deep cuts in its feed-in tariff. As I have been told by very senior sources in government, such a move was being recommended by a strong lobby of government advisors and civil servants. How could this be so? The tariff had only been instigated in April, and dropping it would have involved the government increasing the deficit it is trying to cut, as it would have lost the tax income from new solar workers and on the products sold. Moreover, it would have had to go out of its way to achieve this step backwards: the feed-in tariff is part of an instrument of law, the Energy Act 2010, which would have had to be unpicked. Friends of the Earth were already threatening legal action to stop this, and the government – had it gone ahead – would have faced negative publicity and accusations that its aspiration to be the greenest government ever was hypocritical tosh. The only reason this was even on the table was because elements in the traditional energy industry have declared a form of war on solar and the other renewables across Europe. They have done it for reasons including the one the Photon editor writes about, plus – as I have experienced it – a dangerous element of \"groupthink\": a culture holding that grown ups only get their energy from big centralised power plants, and the hippy dippy cleantech stuff can only occupy a token margin. The status quo protectors lobby hard, mostly behind closed doors, to undermine decentralised renewables and even – when they see the chance – derail them. The net outcome, of course, is that neither centralised nor decentralised power are mobilised as fast as they could be, and energy efficiency measures are certainly not being mobilised fast enough to take up the slack. That is why the lights will probably go out in a few years time. Jeremy Leggett is executive chair of Solarcentury, He also publishes a blog on www.jeremyleggett.net.

IDC: Android now leads the tablet market with a 56.5% share &gt;&gt; Android Central Jerry Hildenbrand: These sorts of numbers make CEOs and people who count pennies pretty happy, and will be the fuel for fanboy wars across the Internet, but why are they important? I'll tell you why - because the available selection of applications designed for Android tablets sucks. Google keeps telling developers exactly how to build their app to take advantage of the real estate on a tablet, but because there weren't that many out there, nobody listened. Sure, there are some really great applications done \"right\" and look fabulous on our tablets, but most of them are just the phone version blown up to fill the seven or ten inch screen on your tablet with unused white space. Have a look at iPad apps, and you'll know exactly what I mean. Hopefully, with more Android tablets being sold than any others, developers will take notice and change this. Only if they can monetise those apps. If they can't, then all that happens is that people have some cheap Android tablets and some blown-up apps, because why bother? (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.) Worldwide tablet market surges ahead on strong first quarter sales &gt;&gt; IDC \"Sustained demand for the iPad mini and increasingly strong commercial shipments led to a better-than expected first quarter for Apple,\" said Tom Mainelli, Research Director, Tablets at IDC. \"In addition, by moving the iPad launch to the fourth quarter of 2012, Apple seems to have avoided the typical first-quarter slowdown that traditionally occurred when consumers held off buying in January and February in anticipation of a new product launch in March.\" 49.2m total: more than desktops, and about equal with laptops. Apple's market share fell below 40% - but the market is growing so fast that in terms of actual units sold (comparing 1Q 2012 and 1Q 2013) it shifted nearly as many extra tablets year-on-year as Samsung did in the whole quarter (7.7m v 8.8m). The big difference is in \"Others\" - which now make nearly a third of the market, compared to a quarter a year before. Those are the cheaper Android tablets which are going to overtake the market this year.

Mobile phone data redraws bus routes in Africa &gt;&gt; BBC News Researchers at IBM have redrawn the bus routes of Ivory Coast's largest city using mobile phone data. The research was completed as part of the Data for Development competition run by Orange which released 2.5bn call records from 5m mobile phone users in Ivory Coast. The anonymised data is the largest of its kind ever released. Such data could be used by urban planners for new infrastructure projects, said IBM. Discovery: they could reduce travel times for people by 10%. If they could have integrated it with bus timetables.. Ghana's ISPs are dying out because the mobile web is booming &gt;&gt; Quartz Ghana boasts Africa's highest penetration of mobile broadband, at 23% of the population in 2011, the latest year for which figures are available. That compares with just 7% in 2010. By contrast, fixed-broadband penetration stood at a negligible 0.3% in 2011, and that's killing Ghana's internet service providers (ISPs). For a time, running an ISP was a trendy thing. Some 150 companies presently have a license, and about 20 are operational. But many of them are finding it hard to stay afloat. Even cyber cafés, many of which are run by ISPs, are beginning to shut down. Ghana's biggest, which had 100 connections and its own satellite connection, closed in February. One would guess that mobile broadband is a lot higher than 23% by 2013. Another unexpected consequence of the rise of the smartphone: in effect, it drives arbitrage between pricing of mobile and fixed broadband.

HTC and Samsung &gt;&gt; Benedict Evans Both companies disclose a 'sales and marketing' line. For Samsung this includes activities for the TV and domestic appliance divisions, but the way the spending has grown in recent years suggests that the great majority of the spending is for mobile - and of course the brand is the same anyway, so advertising for TVs will also bleed across to phones. Where is this money going? Well, Samsung discloses a split in the 'sales and marketing' line - around 40% is advertising and the rest is 'sales promotion expenses' - a lot of which is sales commissions. In Q4 2012 Samsung's budget was 13 times HTC's. Samsung hasn't disclosed the Q1 number yet, but if it dropped to, say, $2.5bn in Q1, the same proportionate shift as at the beginning of 2012, it would be about 19 times bigger Dumped! by Google &gt;&gt; The Last Word On Nothing Tienlen Ho: In case you're wondering, in the end, I was fortunate.

While this is tough news for manufacturers, lower prices have spurred a steady growth in solar power installations in the US, especially in rooftop systems for the residential market. This sector has shown incremental growth over the past four quarters. Not only is this good news for renewable energy advocates, but also for solar installers and the companies that serve this market like San Francisco-based Clean Power Finance. The company estimates that more than a third of residential solar deals in the US now flow through its online marketplace, where solar sales professionals can develop quotes, design the system and arrange for financing. Serial technology entrepreneur, Gary Kremen, founded the company in 2007. His earlier successes included the dating site Match.com. Nat Kreamer, chief executive at Clean Power Finance, says Kremen wanted to create an online marketplace for sellers and investors. \"Gary envisioned a business that connected companies selling and installing solar with companies financing solar via an online software platform that improved access to solar financing.\" Homeowners interested in solar power can be scared away by the hefty upfront installation costs. That's why many deals now depend on third party financing using leases or power purchase agreements. Because installers don't always have the resources to provide financing, they look to Clean Power Finance to serve as matchmaker bringing together projects with investors. Kreamer says the company strives to offer multiple financing products that are tailored to fit specific consumer needs and credit requirements. The company's practice is to charge fixed, transparent transaction fees. \"We make more money when our customers sell more financing,\" he says. \"We are profitable when our partners make money.\" Typically, the organisation that finances the system will retain ownership. The homeowner pays no upfront cost for the installation, but instead pays a monthly fee for the system usually below what they were paying the local utility for electricity from the grid. Clean Power Finance says it now manages some half a billion dollars on behalf of project finance investors, including a $75m fund for Google. Beyond simplifying the financing process, the company is working in other areas to speed the uptake of rooftop solar power. For instance, project developers often find that working through the maze of local zoning and permitting requirements can add time and cost to the project. With a $3m grant from the US Department of Energy, Clean Power Finance recently completed a database of local building regulations that covers more than 7,500 US post codes. Once launched, the database will be free to use for anyone in the industry. The 2012 Global Cleantech 100 was created by the Cleantech Group.

Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/06/doha-most-progressive-country-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/dec/06/doha-most-progressive-country-wales","fields":{"headline":"Doha's most progressive country on climate change? Wales","bodyText":"Welsh assembly member John Griffiths stands out from the hordes of other environment ministers scurrying around the UN climate talks in Doha. Along with Edna Molewa of South Africa, he can claim to represent a country that has enshrined sustainable development in its constitution. But Griffiths can go further than any of the 194 countries at the talks. Unless there is a political upset, he says, Wales will become the first country in the world to make it legally binding for all public bodies, from health trusts to libraries and schools, to take account of the environment and social issues when they make a decision. The sustainable development bill should be delivered in just under a year, says Griffiths, who is in Doha to meet other regional governments like Catalonia, Brittany and Quebec, as well as UN agencies. \"It would be a legal first,\" he says. \"A country may be small but it can be smart and far-sighted.\" Wales, he says, walks the walk, and has a good story to tell the world. Not only has it set itself a target to reduce emissions by 3% a year, meaning a 40% reduction by 2020, it is also leading the UK in renewable energy. It also has ambitious plans to retrofit homes and improve energy efficiency in social housing. The embarrassing fact that Welsh greenhouse emissions increased by 8% between 2009 and 2010 compared with just 2% in England is officially put down to the very cold winter and the economic recovery. Griffiths wants more onshore and offshore wind but recognises the vehement opposition that turbines and pylons have met in mid-Wales and elsewhere. The answer, he says, is to find ways to make companies benefit communities. \"We are in discussions with companies to get more community benefit, and to provide more jobs. We need to paint a positive picture around renewables in Wales. There's a lot of benefit for us if we get it right.\" Wales is brimming with renewable energy companies and he sees the future not just in wind but marine and even solar energy. \"We expect to see great development of the potential. But there's not much coal left now. It's pretty marginal.\" The culture shock of being in Qatar is enormous, he says. The two small countries have roughly the same populations but there any similarity stops. The gulf state gets less than 3in of rain a year, roughly what St Asaph got in a few hours this week. Equally, the Emir of Qatar is believed to receive more money in a day from Qatar's gasfields than the £300m Griffiths gets to spend on climate change measures in Wales over the next 10 years. But Qatar has strong links to Wales. Gas from the gulf state mostly lands in Britain at Milford Haven, and then goes by pipeline to Gloucestershire. The £13bn project was fought by protesters on both environmental and safety grounds. Griffiths links climate change with the recent floods in Wales. \"We in Britain had the wettest summer for 100 years. Now we are told we will have more extremes [like this] with climate change. It was very much in line with climate change. Floods like that and the one at Talybont bring climate change home to people. It will have a severe impact.\" He wants Wales to take its position as a small, outward-looking, progressive state. This week he has seen the Lesotho minister of the environment and has agreed to help develop the small southern African country's climate change strategy. Wales cannot possibly give on the level of Qatar but, says Griffiths, it can contribute. Welsh businesses, organisations, schools and community groups have all helped the charity Size of Wales raise £1.5m to help protect two million hectares – the size of Wales – of tropical forest in Africa, Central and South America. \"I saw for myself when I visited Uganda in 2010 the devastating impact of climate change and the great work of our partners who are planting one million trees with the support of Size of Wales,\" he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-manzini-swaziland","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-15T09:26:57Z","webTitle":"Rio+20: A voice from Manzini, Swaziland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-manzini-swaziland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-manzini-swaziland","fields":{"headline":"Rio+20: A voice from Manzini, Swaziland","bodyText":"If you look at the millennium development goals not one of them is unaffected by climate change.

They are very heavy and they end around February. My parents have not had a maize harvest for five years. They are only managing to grow groundnuts and millet now. When boreholes dry up around October, you start to have sanitation issues, like cholera or diarrhoea. When rivers dry up because the rains are late, livestock die and children are kept out of school. In rural Zimbabwe people pay school expenses – fees, books and uniforms – by selling their cattle. When families have no cattle, children are kept out of school. This aggravates the Aids situation because teenage girls hang around the shops and have sex with strangers for $10. That is when they get HIV. You cannot address sustainable development or start talking about solar energy until people have something to eat. That is why HIV educators in Zimbabwe now travel with the people handing out food aid.

This makes sense, the administration has positive numbers to point to – 28 straight months of job growth, a dramatically improved stock market – and his approval rating (inextricably linked to the economy) is inching upwards. At the same time, aides have apparently bemoaned coverage of the inaugural address as over-emphasizing the president's increased activism on social issues. We'll know soon enough how much of this sub rosa chatter was a game of expectations-setting and media skid-greasing, but I suspect that the speech will sound less like an economic primer and more like the \"come at me, bro\" marker-setting that's come to characterize post-election Obama. I believe now the administration's second term is built on these gestures. Barack Obama's next four years has begun by rolling him out at Troller-in-Chief. For the most part, the social media savvy of the Obama White House has been positive in messages and outcomes: they rally people around hashtags, make photos go viral, reveal senses of humor at once nerdy and winsome (add to Biden crashing a Reddit AMA and the official Death Star proposal response, Steven Chu's non-denial denial of a solar energy love affair). But what the Obama team is really good at is trolling – that guilty pleasure of know-it-alls everywhere: Go ahead, get mad: that's my plan. Trolling is just a perverse refinement of the administration's more obvious fluency in modern media, making intentional a chain reaction that's occurred regularly since he walked on the national stage: Obama's ability to infuriate conservatives by his very existence. What's new is the glee his team takes in setting that chain reaction off: note the decision to release photos of the president skeet shooting – not with a resigned sense of \"now, do you believe us?\" but rather, as Obama adviser David Plouffe tweeted: Attn skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin! m.flickr.com/photos/whiteho… — David Plouffe (@davidplouffe) February 2, 2013 And conservatives duly complied. So, expect Obama to bemoan the sequester's drastic cuts in spending even though, yes, the White House agreed to them as fully as did the GOP. Republicans will froth and churn out emails and Fox News soundbites proving White House complicity, which will matter little if one is mainly concerned about preventing the cuts. Americans, when polled, typically self-divided, would like both to cut spending in general (as opposed to raising taxes, 49 to 30%) and to not cut any of the specific programs up for consideration (though 40% agree the military should be up for consideration). This is not an ideal attitude in a citizenry, but it is one that the Obama administration can work to its advantage at the moment. It wouldn't be real Obama trolling if they left out social issues entirely, either. In his references to climate change, gun law, immigration and marriage equality, he'll either highlight GOP exceptions and compromisers – their \"bravery\" or some such – or he'll talk about putting the people, justice, planet, safety or children \"first\", a flick at the supposed selfishness of those who disagree with the policies he's forwarding. This has happened often enough that I think Republicans are working on a hashtag for it. But Obama is not mischaracterizing his opponents so much as digging into their egos, hoping they will protectively inflate and expand to fill airtime on Fox, where the discussion will inevitably be about tactics, hypocrisy, and anger. Meanwhile, the president signs executive orders and keeps in step with America's larger lurch leftward. Marco Rubio, the official GOP rebutter Tuesday night, is young enough at least to grasp the format of the troll v trolled relationship. He is also a fan of hip-hop, a genre that rewards unflappability and preaches striking back at opponents' weaknesses rather than getting sidetracked into a debate about one's own. (The featured speaker at the next Republican retreat should be Eminem, who meets the Republican requirements for minority outreach as well.) But Rubio will only be as effective as Republicans let him be. The post-state of the union spot has recently not benefited either the guest or the party, and one interpretation of Rubio's selection is that the GOP continues to believe that its problem lies in the messengers and not the message. Rubio, after all, has succeeded in his party not because he has said anything different than what his colleagues are saying, but because he says it most pleasantly. Policy-wise, for the most part, Rubio is an unreconstructed southern Republican. And on immigration, where he is substantially more moderate than most Republican officials, conservative commentators appear to just ignore the great swath of agreement between Rubio and Obama and focus on how Rubio could beat the guy. The GOP got stuck in its own Obamacentrism, pinning all its hopes in 2012 on an anti-Obama strategy that might have resonated in 2010, but was well past its sell-by date before the Republican primary season was done. What his GOP opponents missed was that Obama won in 2008, in part, because he wasn't a direct response to George W Bush: he rode in not on a vengeful wish to undo the past, but on a wave of optimism about how the future could be different. And now, after weathering GOP rage through his first term and learning the fruitlessness of placating it, Obama has found a way to turn his opponents' anger against themselves. Hail the Troller-in-Chief."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/musicblog/2013/jun/30/glastonbury-2013-live-coverage-day-three","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-30T19:28:21Z","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2013: live coverage, day three","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jun/30/glastonbury-2013-live-coverage-day-three","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/musicblog/2013/jun/30/glastonbury-2013-live-coverage-day-three","fields":{"headline":"Glastonbury 2013: live coverage, day three","bodyText":"So in short order: It was another day of beautiful weather Loads and loads of bands played and if you were here and saw them you'd probably think them alll brilliant, and if not, you might not believe that There was, of course, a whole lotta else in places like the Circus field and the Kids field and over in the Green and Healing fields. There are some beautiful images of that sort of thing here. Michael Eavis said the following of last night's headliners: \"It's the best thing. It has to be doesn't it? Forty-three years of me; 50 years of them and we've finally come together. We're on the same page at last. Isn't that brilliant?\" Thanks for reading. Once more, join Michael Hann for the Mumfords and more now. OK - slight delay there as I got called to help out on the final Music Weekly podcast from the festival, which we'll be launching soon enough, Glastonbury time allowing. In the meantime, Michael Hann has kicked things off with a new blog that will cover this evening's action so you're advised to head here: SUNDAY NIGHT BLOG! Before Michael picks up the blog later, here's Peter Robinson offering his thoughts on what it's been like to watch the festival from (again) a kitchen. Peter Robinson writes! Thanks to blanket coverage, one benefit of not being at Glastonbury in 2013 is that you actually get to see what's happening. I know that Nile Rodgers doesn't mind having his arm touched by Craig Charles. I also know that Jordan from Rizzle Kicks has a nice jumper with a fox on it, and I've now experienced the full HD horror of Miles Kane's union flag \"ensemble\". Just to show we're nothing if we're not eclectic, we've also got for your delight: Glastonbury 2013: views from Leftfield While others were having fun in the sun, comedians, activists, singers and politicians were putting the world to rights in the festival's most radical corner. And this: 'My bus smells of wee!' Celebrities on their Glastonbury 2013 experience What's the weirdest thing you've seen? Probably my own bus! Honestly, be better organised, guys! It's from the 80s and it smells of vomit and wee. I mean, I am thankful to have a bus but we parked up next to the Rolling Stones crew and I could see them all sniggering and laughing at us. Ondatrópica at West Holts were, incidentally, amazing - they're sort of a Colombian version of the Buena Vista Club, assembled with the help of UK producer Will Holland to \"re-interpret the tropical musical heritage\" of the country. It's beautifiul to hear how that heritage encompasses elements of (for instance) ska, and in the late afternoon sun they were perfect. And while I called Best Suit of the festival yesterday when Bobby Gillespie came on in his fuschia (is that right? see below) number, the band here, dressed in aquamarine, surely ran him close. But you don't really want to know about that, do you? You want the verdict on Kenny Rogers (courtesy of Dorian Lynskey). The snowy-haired 74-year-old country singer doesn't have very many songs that everybody knows, but he has such wry good humour that he could give younger acts a masterclass in how to win over an initially reticent field. When he holds out his mic during the chorus of Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town and receives little more than a half-hearted sigh, he teases: \"They sang that better in Morocco. And they don't even speak English in Morocco!\" Full-fat version here. Evening all, Caspar Llewellyn Smith here taking over on the blog from Paul MacInnes for an hour or so, at which point we'll be going LIVE to Michael Hann, who'll be handling matters from a friend's kitchen in north London. Here's some pictorial proof that I've been working quite hard today. (Although this last image was taken at my friend's camper van, which is sited absolutely miles away from anything, so I missed a couple of hours there. On the plus side, foodie fans, it was up there with the Thai beef salad I had the other night as my best meal of the festival.) Here's Kieran Yates's video interview with John 'Johnny' Lydon 'Rotten' Rita Ora deliberately dresses like Rihanna yeah? Click through to read in full but as a teaser treat, here's Mark Beaumont's high point for you: High point: A sing-along to Wetsuit so loud it must’ve made people at the Park Stage wonder where the distant mass scuba-diving lesson was happening Kieran Yates, in her one-woman quest to interview EVERY star on site, has grabbed a moment with PiL head John Lydon (note no Sir there yet). Along the way she explained to him what a 'selfie' was. And before any of you lot crack the gag, it doesn't mean that. Here's that Sir Brucie review as promised. Only three stars from me, so me and you ain't so far apart numinous. Also, Mark Beaumont's just filed his dispatch from potential headliners in waiting, the Vaccines. They got such a huge crowd at William's Green that the whole are was declared 'full' and they've got four stars from Beaumont too. Full review shortly As well as chatting with Kieran, Micheal Eavis has been chatting to the press about his Saturday night headliners: \"It's the high spot of 43 years of Glastonbury. It's the whole razzmatazz of the occasion the two of us finally getting together at long last.\" So that's a pretty effusive verdict then. (Although i'm sure I can remember him saying something similar about Sir Paul McCartney in 2005.) Meanwhile on the #glasto hashtag, a very contrasting view Not everyone is as Brucey-philiac as the four friends in the pic above. Numinous writes in the comments; It's typical of how wretched and truly irrelevant Glastonbury has become that the likes of Bruce Forsyth is a performer. Shocking and shameful - our culture is now totally ossified and Tory-ised. Why not get Terry Wogan to host it next year? It's an interesting point, for sure, but you could easily argue that acts like Sir Brucie make Glastonbury more relevant to more people, not less. He's hardly representative of the avant garde, but he certainly draws a bigger crowd and as such - whether you like it or not - is representative of 'our' culture. etc and Lol Hey there you guys, Paul MacInnes here, jumping into the hotseat for the next wee while. I just had my first Tuborg of the day (Tuborg??? Cyborg more like!) and am fresh back from watching Sir Bruce Forsyth make like alternative comedy never happened. Which, given what happened to alternative comedy, may be no bad thing. There'll be a review of that forthcoming, don't you worry And here's the video of Kieran's chat with Michael Eavis, who's having a lovely time. Another video from the BBC - this one's of Chase &amp; Status’ Saturday night performance with Louis M^ttrs. Look who Kieran Yates has been bothering now – it's Michael Eavis. A video of this encounter to follow shortly… Courtesy of the BBC now, here's a video of Azealia Banks doing that rude song she does. The Rolling Stones were \"the festival's best ever headliners,\" says Michael Eavis according to this news story. \"Musically, they were absolutely brilliant,\" said Eavis, who claimed the band were number one in his top 10 of headliners, above Radiohead, U2 and Oasis. \"Mick Jagger's energy leading that band with such a passion and so much style; he was absolutely amazing. I've never seen anything like it. It's quite remarkable to think he can go like that, at his age. \"I'm a bit older and I couldn't keep going. His legs and his arms and his movement – he was going for it like his life depended on it.\" Full story here. If Michael Eavis was impressed by old man Jagger's moves, he would have been blown away Bruce Forsyth this afternoon. Paul MacInnes was in attendance, and we'll be bringing you his review shortly (just as soon as he manages to log in to the work laptop.) Here's a photo from The xx's brief set earlier today (shortly before they were booed off). Hello, Adam Boult here for a liveblogging stint. It's another hot and sunny afternoon, and Glastonbury is BUSY. Locals with Sunday-only tickets are pouring on to the site, making the whole thing even more crowded than it has been so far (and it was already pretty damn crowded). Having been defeated in my efforts to get into the William's Green tent for Palma Violets, I just shuffled through the crowds to the Avalon field, where this man… …was doing his thing in the full-to-capacity tent. This is Rebecca signing off the liveblog - thanks so much for reading along, it's been fun. I leave you with this video of Kieran interviewing the delightful Phoenix, who once saw a very intimate act in the audience during a live performance... The Staves have been to see Bruce Forsyth and have spotted a lot of men in leotards. Helen Pidd sends this report from that secret(ish), and, it turns out, very short xx show: The BBC Introducing tent was full to bursting for a hastily arranged set from the xx. The glum-faced trio trooped on just after 3pm and began Fiction acapella. The crowd was just warming up when Oliver Sim announced the next track would be their last. And lo, it was. They left the stage to halfhearted booing. Two songs! It is fair to say some members of the audience felt short changed. And no Chase &amp; Status either! Outrageous. The Staves are here too. Might just set up the Portable Cabin* Stage and be done with it. *please note, this is definitely a generic portable cabin and in no way will we truncate this into a more recognisable brand name. We'll have a live-action video of this shortly, but for now, here's a live-action photograph of Kieran Yates chatting to two of Phoenix, who headline John Peel tonight, outside the portable cabin. Caspar Llewellyn Smith is having his own spiritual Sunday, it seems, undertaking a pilgrimage to the Healing field: There are osteopaths, folks with banjos singing Waterboys songs, a tent which advertises its business as \"association of radical midwives\", herbalists and tarot readers. Could be time to head into the free Alexander technique workshop that's about to start. Then following that up with a trip to hip-hop karaoke, on the outskirts of the Park: Someone called Billy has just been awarded 10 seconds of applause for a stunning freestyle. Now it's the turn of a person called Insanity Prawnlife, I think, who's doing a passable Busta Rhymes. Crowd-surfing baby alert: The sight of the first ever baby crowd-surfer was certainly one of Glastonbury's more surreal moments – and that's coming from a writer who this year watched a gig alongside a 70-year-old rocker sporting a fluorescent green moustache. The baby in question did at least surf with the protection of a baby buggy, hoisted up, I originally assumed, by parents desperate to immerse their sprog in the most bruising of gig rituals. I can hear Deap Vally's Baby I Call Hell ringing out loud and clear from my prime spot in a portable cabin behind the Pyramid stage. Only they're not on the Pyramid stage: according to my programme, they're on the John Peel stage, which is miles away. Therefore I'm calling them as loudest band of the festival. Word is out on site about the xx's surprise(ish) BBC Introducing show at 3pm. Theresa Malone says the tent is already full, and a big crowd is gathering outside. Lexy Topping's been out to see Bath band the Heavy on the Other stage: Kelvin Swaby whipped up a bleary-eyed crowd from the word go, egging on mass singalongs, hand waving and pogo-jumping. Big horns, funk-heavy basslines and lots of energy made for a fun set. They finished in style, with Swaby, now stripped down to a white vest, yelling \"How you like me now?\" to the moshing audience. Their response? Quite a lot, thank you very much. Here's a gallery of the weird and wonderful twilight world that is Glastonbury after dark. No sign of Bez's Acid House – don't ask – but that's probably for the best. Last night we sent Tom Meltzer to watch the Bootleg Beatles instead of the Stones, and he loved it. A faithful opening salvo of I Saw Her Standing There, She Loves You and I Wanna Hold Your Hand had everyone up and bopping, from teens in caps and high-tops waving iPhones to veterans old enough to have seen the real deal. In the quieter moments, you could hear Jagger et al half a mile away, but few wandered off. By the time the tribute band launched into Help!, six hits in, the crowd had doubled in size. Below the belt, folks. Below the belt. What to do by the third day of a festival, when dry shampoo is no longer up to the job? Here's one Stones fan's unique solution to the perennial problem of festival hair. You leave Michael Hann in charge of the liveblog for one night, and he sparks a diplomatic incident: Despite my professing that – almost uniquely among music writers – I have no problem with Mumford &amp; Sons, I appear to have outraged one fansite by saying on last night's liveblog that they'd need to cure cancer, end global warming and slip me a couple of million quid to make up for causing me to miss Springsteen at the Olympic Park. Mumford News seems to be demanding a mass protest to the Guardian, so outraged is it. MORE BREAKING STORNOWAY NEWS: In tribute to Wiley pulling out because \"the weather was too bad and there wasn't enough money for him\", Stornoway are now doing a bluegrass cover called Wearing My Casio. Writer Sam Wolfson has dropped by the Guardian portacabin to describe what he saw last night: a Mosca set in a tube train carriage. \"All the lesbian poetry crew were there,\" apparently. I have no idea what he's talking about but he seems enthusiastic. More from the frontline. Mark Beaumont just saw Stornoway have a morbid turn: Stornoway have brought their own moon for their set, and dedicate Coldharbour Road to the circling seagulls that \"are getting more confident by the day, soon they'll be feasting on the corpses\". Surprisingly uplifting tunes, considering. Confirmation! Chalkboard outside the small BBC Introducing stage promising The xx at 3pm. Not quite a surprise in that they're telling us it will happen, but still! Can't wait to see their special guests David Bowie, Lady Gaga and Daft Punk. And Chase &amp; Status. You heard it here first. I've just heard the first festival rumour of the day, and it involves a large band playing a surprise set on a small stage. Hold tight for confirmation – we don't want this to turn into another \"It's Daft Punk! Oh it's Chase &amp; Status\" situation. Last night, meanwhile, Mark Beaumont went to see Chase &amp; Status. It did not make him a bit emotional: Rage's incessant urgings that we jump and/or scream start feeling like a particularly intense go-for-the-burn workout video. Guardian picture editor Karin Andreasson has been over to the Pyramid to watch First Aid Kit, and it made her a bit emotional: I can definitely say that any morning-after blues have been washed away by their glorious harmonies. I had goosebumps and even some tears in my eyes, and honestly it's not just because I'm exhausted. Couldn't have asked for a better gig to start Sunday. Late last night, I joined Alexis Petridis and Kieran Yates to record a special post-Stones edition of Music Weekly, rounding up day 2 of the festival. We discussed \"half-bum\", the festival fashion trend that is this year's \"sideboob\", and Fatboy Slim popped in for a chat, but not about that. A lovely video from John Harris, who spent a spiritual weekend in search of God. Along the way, found Christmas, clarinet-tooting nuns, Hare Krishna, hymns, Johnny Marr and a pagan wedding. This year's Glastonbury has been a cracker, and as such, the worst thing that's happened to me all weekend is a nasty case of sunburn down my parting. But here's a reflective piece from Observer columnist Eva Wiseman, who had her festival buzz killed for good in the year of torrential, tent-toppling rain. (If anyone's got any tips about what to do with scalp-burn, please share them below.) Stuart Heritage has been looking at celebrity Glastonbury Instagrams! Or Celebstongrams, if you're short of time. If you've ever wanted to see Harry Styles meeting Sebadoh's Lou Barlow, now's your chance. There's also someone from Made in Chelsea. (Handy tip, not just for Glastonbury but for life: if you witness someone getting papped, and are asked who it is, just say, \"Oh it's thingy from Made in Chelsea\" and you will inevitably be right.) Lost of rumours that Prince Harry was hanging around backstage, but apparently he's brought his nan with him, too. Bear with me while I pretend to be the Racing Post for a minute: post-Stones, Ladbrokes are offering odds of 4/5 on tickets for Glastonbury 2014 selling out in record time, and, in a Debbie Downer move, they've also given 6/4 that Eavis will retire the festival on its 50th anniversary in 2020. I don't know about you lot but I'm heading straight to the bookies to place that bet then wait for seven years to see if it comes good. Yesterday Mark Beaumont wandered off to the outer fringes of the festival, and came across this lot: In the corner of Green Futures, a large, bearded man approaches proferring Sharpies. “Do you want to draw on my shed?” It’s not often a refusal to vandalise is deemed rude, but all social mores should be discarded during an afternoon stroll around Glastonbury’s fringes. In the space of a few hours, we’ve attempted to gate-crash an Ecstatic Birth Workshop in the Tipi Field, partaken of some hula hoop therapy in the Healing Field (which actually set back years of psychiatric work on my unco-ordinated gangliness issues), learnt to salsa near The Common and considered signing up to the Solar Energy Alliance near the Croissant Neuf stage, only balking for fear of being drawn into a bitter rivalry with the Solar Energy Democratic People’s Front (splitters). In Speaker’s Corner we get our daily slab of The Truth, and in the Theatre Field, bypassing the Comedy Shed – literally a shed with comedy in, where four audience members are entertained by two comedians for 20 minutes – we come across Talula The Psychic Midget, smashing lightbulbs with her mind and actually levitating. Far more than previous years, I've met a lot of people enjoying their first ever Glastonbury. Here, for example, is the Guardian's own Kieran Yates, taking in the full experience. Mind you, the more seasoned attendees have been having Sunday morning struggles of their own. While everyone's waking up, here's a summary of what happened last night when the Rolling Stones headlined the Pyramid stage. Here's Dorian Lynskey's five-star review: The final stretch is simply staggering. During Sympathy for the Devil the scrap-metal phoenix at the top of the stage raises its wings and spurts jets of fire, while flares in the middle of the crowd produce suitably infernal red smoke. You Can't Always Get What You Want, with its soaring choir, is hugely moving, an anthem to acceptance which draws celebration from resignation. A raucous, extended Satisfaction sounds like one of rock music's holy relics. It drives home the realisation that the most patiently pursued headliners in Glastonbury's history have finally made it, and they're right here in front of us, and they're very, very good. Here's a picture gallery, from which you can get some sense of the sheer scale of it all, and here's a bunch of very excited people getting very excited about it all, excitably. And here's a poll, featuring obligatory Satisfaction pun, so you can let us know what you thought of their set. As always, rumours have been flying around the site all weekend – Bowie's going to join the Stones! or Chic! or Rita Ora! or all of them! – so it is perhaps unsurprising that last night's Super Special Secret Avalon stage headliners were not Daft Punk, as the woman in front of me at the Rolling Stones last night insisted, but ... Chase &amp; Status. Those punters did not \"Get Lucky\"!!!! (Can someone bring me a coffee please.) Hello and welcome to Sunday at Glastonbury, or Mumford &amp; Sonsday, as I have just christened it, and will immediately retract, with apologies. I'm Rebecca Nicholson and I'll be here for the next few hours, bringing you all the desperately hungover and broken action from the last day of the festival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/renewable-energy-storage-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-18T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"The challenge of energy storage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/renewable-energy-storage-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/renewable-energy-storage-solutions","fields":{"headline":"The challenge of energy storage","bodyText":"When we used to burn wood for heat, energy storage wasn't a problem – a stack of logs in the shed did the job nicely. The oil, coal and gas used to industrialise society offers equally neat storage solutions, while the invention of batteries allows us to carry small amounts of electricity around. But now, as the decarbonising economy demands increasing amounts of electricity be produced by wind turbines and solar panels, new forms of energy storage have to be found. A blend of high and low tech has developed to create a market that US analysts Pike Research predict will be worth $122bn by 2021. Perhaps the most celebrated UK system is the Dinorwig power station in North Wales, where water is pumped uphill using cheap, off-peak electricity and then released during periods of high demand - a process that actually uses more electricity than it generates, but still cuts emissions. Other mechanical processes include storing kinetic energy in spinning flywheels or using electricity generated by wind turbines to compress air, which is then released to rotate turbine blades when needed. Conventionally, the air or gas has been stored in underground caverns, but US firm SustainX has pioneered the use of overground tanks that use pistons to increase storage capacity further. Solar energy plants are trialling more complex solutions. SolarReserve and Torresol Energy are two of the companies using mirrors to heat molten salt to 1,000°F, which is then released to create steam to turn turbines, generating electricity for well over 10 hours after the sun has set. Of course, there is still a role for batteries, with everything from laptops to electric cars dependent on lithium ion cells. The challenge is to increase capacity without adding to the already hefty cost – the Nissan Leaf's battery is estimated to make up about half of its £30,990 price tag. Leading companies in the space such as 24M Technologies, Amprius, and Sakti3, are keeping their cards close to their chests, making it difficult to predict quite how mooted technologies like flow batteries or the impressively named ultra-batteries - a hybrid energy storage device combining a lead acid battery with an electrochemical capacitor – will work in the future. But what is certain is that demand for energy storage is only going to grow as grid operators add increasing amounts of renewable energy generation. The challenge now is to provide a cost-effective solution. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

But the process is likely to take decades, and some observers are sceptical as to whether it is any more than window-dressing. Prince Turki Al Faisal Al Saud, founder of the King Faisal Foundation and one of the state's top spokesmen, told the Global Economic Symposium in Brazil that he hoped the kingdom might be powered entirely by low-carbon energy within his lifetime – he is 67 – but that he thought it was likely to take longer. However, he insisted Saudi was moving ahead with investment in renewable energy, nuclear power and other alternatives to fossil fuels and that it could use its vast oil reserves for other goods, such as plastics and polymers. \"Oil is more precious for us underground than as a fuel source,\" he said. \"If we can get to the point where we can replace fossil fuels and use oil to produce other products that are useful, that would be very good for the world. I wish that may be in my lifetime, but I don't think it will be.\" Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"It speaks volumes that a Saudi prince can see the benefits of switching to clean energy sources when [UK chancellor] George Osborne seemingly cannot, but Saudi Arabia will only truly be a green economy when it leaves its fossil fuels in the ground.\" Saudi Arabia's energy use is almost entirely from fossil fuels at present, with about two-thirds coming from oil and the remainder from gas. The state produces close to 12m barrels of oil a day, representing more than 12% of world crude production, and has about one-fifth of the world's oil reserves, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. Energy use per person within the kingdom is also high by world standards, because energy prices are kept so low. As Prince Turki noted, however, the kingdom has vast potential for using solar power. \"The cost of solar energy is now 15% of what it was 20 years ago,\" he noted. Saudi Arabia has also signed memoranda of understanding – though no final deal as yet – with Argentina over nuclear energy. But despite his commitment to advancing renewable energy in the Middle East, Prince Turki – who served as director of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services for more than 20 years and has also been an ambassador to the UK and the US – was also clear that the rest of the world was likely to continue to rely on fossil fuels for many years to come. \"No country can ban itself from any one form of energy,\" he said. One of the other potentially important technologies for Saudi Arabia is carbon capture and storage, as depleted oil fields could be used as storage for compressed carbon dioxide, but it has so far made little progress. The prince said the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology should be seen as an international effort rather than the responsibility of single countries. Nebjsa Nakicenovic, deputy chief of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, said CCS was likely to be a vital technology around the world. Though he acknowledged there could be problems, as the technology is still unproven, he warned: \"Do not discount CCS.\" On renewables, Nakicenovic said the world should aim to generate 30% of energy from sustainable renewable sources by 2030. That would represent more than a doubling of current renewable energy usage, because although on paper about 15% of energy now comes from renewable sources, this includes a large amount of biomass – mostly wood, dung and other waste – burned in developing countries. Much of this is unsustainable, and requires a significant use of resources in foraging for firewood. \"So [the target] is very ambitious, but doable,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-06T18:27:16Z","webTitle":"Greece hopes to sell sunshine to Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2011/oct/06/greece-debt-germany-roessler-investment","fields":{"headline":"Germany may buy Greeks' sunshine","bodyText":"Germany's economy minister, Philipp Rösler, arrived in Athens on Thursday with businessmen, entrepreneurs, financiers and green energy experts in what was billed as a potentially groundbreaking visit to draw badly needed investment into the debt-stricken country. The prospect of German business reviving Greece's economy might have seemed far-fetched not long ago: at 109 in the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" index, the nation ranks below Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Yemen. Foreign direct investment in the country was on a par with that of Libya before the outbreak of war. But like all great crises, Greece's debt drama has also provided opportunities. Before departing Berlin, Rösler, who had previously advocated an \"orderly bankruptcy\" for Athens, said he hoped the visit would \"act as a door-opener, so that personal contacts can be made\". \"In the spirit of solidarity, it is the task of all Europeans to help Greece get back on its feet economically,\" he told the German broadcaster ZDF. \"And we want to take German firms to Greece,\" he added, where the crisis was both about \"debt … and the lack of economic competitiveness\". With markets far from convinced that Greece will be spared a default 17 months after it secured €110bn (£97bn) in rescue funds, Athens faces a tough sell. As the German delegation flew into the capital, the prime minister, George Papandreou, was working at breakneck speed to push a draconian austerity package through parliament – a condition made by the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, the country's creditors, in return for further aid. But while rampant corruption, a notorious bureaucracy and a weak justice system have also played a major part in keeping foreign firms out of the European Union state, the ruling socialists are also hoping the country's abundant sunshine can attract German renewable energy companies. Among the 60 business leaders travelling with Rösler are several from the alternative energy sector, which, if expanded, could see foreign lenders help kickstart Greece's recession-hit economy along with tourism and food processing. Plans are also afoot to develop about 20,000 hectares of solar power parks for exporting renewable energy to Germany, according to media reports. With the Greek economy poised to contract for a fourth consecutive year, officials say green energy could create 60,000 jobs at a time of record unemployment. In the wake of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, the decision of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to close all 17 German nuclear reactors by 2022, alternative sources of energy are set to become increasingly important for Berlin. \"Greece could become the showcase of solar development in Europe's 'sun belt' and that development could become the main driver of Greece's green economic growth,\" said Costas Karayiannis, chief executive of Greece's only solar energy investment fund, Axeon Navitas. \"Germany is the global leader in solar energy and it has a lot less sun than Greece. It makes a lot of sense for it to invest in this type of project here.\" Most Greeks are not sure what to think, preferring to see what emerges from Rösler's visit. Memories of Nazi rule in a country that saw one of the most brutal German occupations during the second world war are never far away – even if Berlin has emerged as the main provider of the bailout that has so far enabled Greece to avert bankruptcy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/best-practice-exchange/solarcentury-worlds-largest-solar-bridge","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business/best-practice-exchange","sectionName":"Best practice exchange","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-30T11:01:11Z","webTitle":"Solarcentury helps build world's largest solar bridge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/best-practice-exchange/solarcentury-worlds-largest-solar-bridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/best-practice-exchange/solarcentury-worlds-largest-solar-bridge","fields":{"headline":"Solarcentury helps build world's largest solar bridge","bodyText":"London's new Blackfriars station, spanning the river Thames, will be the world's largest solar bridge when it opens in time for the Olympics in June 2012. Powered by more over 4,400 solar photovoltaic panels, the bridge is being completely renovated by Network Rail in partnership with Solarcentury. An electrical engineering collaboration along with Balfour Beatty and Jacobs Engineering, the structure will generate 900,000kWh of electricity a year and 50% of the station's energy needs, reducing carbon emissions by about 511 tonnes a year. Further energy saving measures include rainwater harvesting and sun pipes for natural lighting. Network Rail and Solarcentury say the project will radically reduce grid electricity consumption and create energy independence. It is claimed to be one of the most significant steps in micro-generation in the UK. As well as providing better Thameslink services between Bedford and Brighton, it demonstrates how clean solar power can be designed for use in dense urban areas. Solarcentury has a public mission to tackle global warming using solar energy in the built environment. The £5.5m Victorian bridge renovation is the world's second solar bridge.

In an extraordinary standoff, the Treasury has refused to send a minister to answer the concerns of the cross-party energy and climate change select committee – prompting a furious response from the committee's Tory chair, Tim Yeo. Further riling the body, which has been asked by ministers to scrutinise the draft energy bill for parliament, the junior Treasury minister, Chloe Smith, has subsequently even refused to answer a series of written questions, which MPs believe must be addressed if the plans to reform the electricity market are to become workable. The dispute is expected to become public next week, when the committee publishes a report on the bill. The Treasury is likely to face strong criticism for standing in the way of the legislative process and failing to address the concerns of potential investors in clean energy, who say that flaws in the legislation, as currently drafted, will endanger the quest for cleaner energy at affordable prices. Earlier this year, the chancellor was in a furious dispute with the solar energy sector over subsidy levels. At the time, the Observer revealed that he was planning to cut subsidies for wind farms by 25% following pressure from more than 100 Tory MPs. Ministers now say that, with a quarter of the UK's generating capacity shutting down over the next 10 years as old coal and nuclear power stations are closed, more than £110bn in new investment will be needed to build the equivalent of 20 large power stations and upgrade the grid. They say that in the longer term, by 2050, electricity demand is expected to double, \"as we shift more transport and heating onto the electricity grid\". The resulting challenge is to provide enough clean energy at low prices. In the Queen's speech in May it was announced that the energy bill would \"propose reform of the electricity market to deliver secure, clean and affordable electricity and ensure prices are fair\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2012/may/25/plantwatch-dandelions-hawthorn-sunshine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-25T21:30:02Z","webTitle":"Plantwatch: The remarkable 'dent de lion' is becoming much more fierce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/25/plantwatch-dandelions-hawthorn-sunshine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2012/may/25/plantwatch-dandelions-hawthorn-sunshine","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: The remarkable 'dent de lion' is becoming much more fierce","bodyText":"After nearly two months of torrential rains, the countryside is now as green as a billiard table, splashed with heaps of dazzling white hawthorn blossom. Trees are in full leaf and grasses are thick and lush, although their vigorous growth is shading out some of the smaller flowering plants, such as the early flowering orchids. But dandelion flowers have sprouted up in huge numbers, gorging themselves on the moisture as well as nutrients washed off farms and gardens. The name dandelion comes from the French \"dent de lion\", meaning lion's tooth from the toothed edges to their leaves. And in a warning sign of the changing atmosphere, the leaves may be getting toothier as carbon dioxide levels increase, as well as making the plants grow taller, lusher and stronger. Flowers such as dandelions also have a canny habit of closing up in the wet weather to protect their pollen from the rain. But now the sun is shining, the flowers are open and making a more dramatic display. Another remarkable spring flower is the mountain avens. This is an ancient relic of the cold climate at the end of the ice age and now grows on mountainsides in Scotland and Snowdonia. In the cold mountain air, the rose-like flowers track the path of the sun during the day like small solar energy collectors, trapping the sun's warmth to entice insects to visit and pollinate, and afterwards the heat is used for incubating the developing seeds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/24/country-diary-cosford-hall-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-24T22:01:00Z","webTitle":"Country diary: Cosford Hall, Suffolk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/24/country-diary-cosford-hall-suffolk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/24/country-diary-cosford-hall-suffolk","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: Cosford Hall, Suffolk","bodyText":"Beating down with Mediterranean intensity, the sun had converted a woodland ride on this private family nature reserve to a linear bath of stale hot air.

If you followed any individual butterfly along its meandering course it slowed, dallied and looped around every blossom and nectar source in sight, and yet never once landed; in truth, they kept flying for so long it was hard to believe that the microgram of wing muscle on these insects could sustain such marathon efforts. When the creature you are pursuing from one end of a sun-baked ride to the other promises to be a species you've never seen before, the chase is all the more maddening. Our quarry was a fiery orange and black creature far bigger than any of the common species – the red admirals, large whites and meadow browns – we'd been watching all day. We knew it was one of the group called the fritillaries and, since all of them have been extinct in Suffolk for decades, we knew that our excitement was at least well founded. Finally this tiny devotee of the July sun deigned to land, and down came the camera shutter on the black scent lines incising its fierce orange upper-wings and on the muted green under-wings crisscrossed by broken patterns of white. It was a silver-washed fritillary, the largest and most impressive of all the British fritillaries and one that has bucked the dismal trend and expanded its range after years of contraction.

On the Marr show on Sunday George Osborne said: I’ve always been someone who thought it’s not a weakness to listen to good arguments. That was a euphemistic way of saying, ‘When I’m wrong, I’ll admit it.’ And today George Osborne performed the biggest U-turn we’ve seen from the Treasury since Alistair Darling had to find £2.7bn to compensate those losing out from Gordon Brown’s abolition of the 10p rate of tax. To his credit, there was no weaselling, or fudging, or pretending “circumstances had changed”; Osborne just accepted the tax credit cuts were a non-starter and chucked them overboard. (Rupert Harrison, his former chief of staff, says that Osborne is a great believer in accepting when you’re going to lose – see 1.02pm.) In what is being dubbed as another U-turn, Osborne has also shelved the proposed police cuts. The whole performance has been funded by a surprise £27bn fiscal windfall, although Osborne is also raising taxes, principally on big business which will have to find almost £3bn a year from 2017 to pay an apprenticeship levy. Tory MPs seemed delighted. By rights, it should have been a bit of a humiliation (not least because Osborne will have to go to the Commons to seek permission to breach his own welfare cap) but Conservatives seem happy to forgive him for extricating himself from a mess that they were applauding when he created in his summer budget. It just goes to show that sometimes politicians have a memory span that would shame a goldfish. More seriously, it illustrates how ministers with authority can get away with almost anything. And political figures without authority … well, just ask John McDonnell. In other circumstances his Mao’s Little Red Book gag might have worked, but if you are a shadow chancellor trying to shake off assertions that you are a far-left obsessive, quoting Mao in the Commons chamber is probably not a wise idea. Earlier I said it did not matter much because no one ever paid any attention to the shadow chancellor’s response. Sorry, that was wrong; on this occasion they will. That’s all from us for tonight. Thanks for the comments. He doesn’t really need the money, but George Osborne could consider picking up a lottery ticket or two on the way home tonight - as he’s clearly on a lucky streak. The Office for Budget Responsibility got the chancellor out of a sticky spot tonight, with a surprisingly upbeat view of the economy and unexpected changes to its modelling; which worked out in Osborne’s favour. They also caught out those of us who, ahem, thought this year’s deficit target was in doubt #meaculpa The OBR’s upward revisions are good news - there’s an extra £27bn of revenue to tap into. The big picture hasn’t changed - growth will only be around trend levels over the next five years, and the national debt will reach a hefty £1.7 trillion by the time the books are balanced. But there are significant differences between the measures announced today, and those implemented in the last parliament. Osborne 2.0 is taking a different approach than the original version. As this chart shows, the consolidation in this parliament relies more on welfare cuts and tax receipts, and less on spending cuts (despite the swingeing measures outlined today) And the government has also lifted and smoothed the path of current spending; it’s no longer planning the severe squeeze outlined in March’s budget: The City has taken today’s statements in its stride. Housebuilding shares jumped by around 3%, on the back of the plan to boost home construction. But the pound is calm tonight at $1.512 to the US dollar, and borrowing costs (yields on UK gilts) are little changed. Two sectors of the UK economy are griping tonight. The first - buy-to let and second-home owners - may not get masses of sympathy over the stamp duty hike. It’s not clear how those changes will pan out; it could make buy-to-let much less attractive, and push down house prices. Or landlords could squeeze renters with higher bills. Business leaders are also grinding their teeth, as they wonder how they’ll find £11bn to cover the Apprenticeship Levy to fund 3 million trainee workers from 2017. Obvious targets include squeezing wages, cutting back on investment, and trimming dividends. They would all be counter-productive for growth. And spare a thought for students, hit with funding cuts and the prospect of paying back their loans sooner (once they find a job) Ultimately, even Lucky George can only do so much -- Britain is still vulnerable to global forces, and a Chinese “hard landing”, or severe geopolitical upheaval, could knock the OBR’s forecasts offline. The Resolution Foundation has led the way in campaigning against the tax credit cuts originally planned by Osborne. Here is the verdict on today’s autumn statement from Torsten Bell, its director. On tax credits it is very welcome that the vast majority of families will not see losses next April. The chancellor has done the right thing by reversing these tax credit cuts entirely, rather than fudging the issue. However Universal Credit is the big loser because the cuts to it have not been reversed. Millions of low-income working families are still set to be significantly worse off by the end of the parliament if the Universal Credit roll-out goes ahead as planned. Pain tomorrow is better than pain today – but it is still pain.” The Chancellor has toned down his plans to shrink the state. But we will still see large cuts that radically change what that state does. By the end of the parliament, the state will be focused on delivering healthcare and paying pensions, but will do much less to support young people or those on low-incomes. And here is the Resolution Foundation’s full briefing on the autumn statement. The chancellor proclaimed in the autumn statement that the big rail electrification projects that were put on hold in the summer, the Midland mainline and TransPennine route, would now go ahead. The suspension of the schemes had threatened to undermine the “Northern Powerhouse” plan”. But they will still be finished late - and the money will mainly be raised by selling off railway land, and an extra £700m will be borrowed, adding to Network Rail’s £38.5bn debt. A review by Network Rail’s chairman Peter Hendy has now confirmed that the majority of the five-year plan can now go ahead with additional investment but found that the original plan was “unrealistic and undeliverable”. Depots, shop space at station and the land under railway arches is all expected to be sold off, to help plug the funding gap after massive cost overruns on electrification work. Hendy said no project would now be cancelled and the bulk of the work would be delivered by March 2019. He said “Some projects will cost more and take longer than originally expected but we will see the job through to deliver better journeys for passengers. My review has clearly found that the original plan was unrealistic and undeliverable.” A separate review by Dame Colette Bowe into the embarrassing Network Rail fiasco has also been slipped quietly out today. Earlier Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said police spending was only being protected in cash terms, not in real terms. See 2.59am. But the Treasury says that is not true. The autumn statement document says: The government will protect overall police spending in real terms over the spending review period, an increase of £900m in cash terms by 2019-20. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has just given an interview to Sky News. He said that Labour had three goals in its campaigning ahead of the autumn statement: to stop the tax credit cuts; to protect police budgets; and to get more money for social care. On the first two at least Labour has been largely successful. But he stressed that the devil was in the detail. Labour thought that families could still be losing out by up to £3bn, he said. Asked if his Little Red Book stunt was a mistake, he said it wasn’t. He was just making a point about how Osborne was opposed to the British government nationalising services while quite happy to let state-run Chinese enterprises operate in this country. He was not holding Mao up as a role model, he said. Conservative MPs have given the chancellor a thumping good welcome over at Westminster: (Desk-banging is a traditional sign of approval at the 1922 committee - the weekly gathering of Tory backbenchers). Mind you, those desks got a good banging back in July (when Osborne announced the tax credit cuts abandoned today), so the ‘22 aren’t infallible. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has not given any TV interviews yet about the autumn statement. His Labour colleagues are having to field questions about his Little Red Book stunt, and the general view seems to be that he would have been better off leaving that joke on the cutting room floor. Here’s a line from Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary. Chris Leslie, the former shadow chancellor, has told BBC that it would be wrong to see the tax credits concession as a U-turn. That is because, as tax credits get phased out and claimants move over to universal credit, the new, less generous benefit regime will come into force anyway. Ben Richards, a researcher for the SMF thinktank, has explained more in a briefing from the SMF. He said: The chancellor performed a major U-turn on tax credits by cancelling the reforms altogether. Instead tax credit claimants will only be affected by the freeze in benefits over the next four years, rather than a cash-terms cut. However, cuts to Universal Credit will remain, and will mean that new Universal Credit claimants are likely to face much more meagre levels of support than those claiming tax credits. In the long run this will mean that the Chancellor’s tax credit cuts in effect are implemented anyway. In the short run, however, it will create a number of issues for claimants, and will make the task of communicating the benefits of Universal Credit an uphill struggle for the Government. First, there are likely to be large inequities between different areas, with areas that have already implemented Universal Credit offering much lower support. In 2016-17 for instance, a one-earner couple with two children would take home nearly £800 more if living in an area using the tax credit system, compared to an area using Universal Credit, if working full-time earning the minimum wage. This could create perceptions of regional unfairness. Second, tax credit claimants have a big incentive not to change their circumstances in areas in which Universal Credit is being rolled out. Since new claimants, and claimants with changed circumstances, are likely to be enrolled in Universal Credit, those already receiving tax credits would do well to stay on them by keeping their circumstances unchanged. This could mean refusing to take on more work, or refusing a promotion, for fear of being unable to reclaim tax credits at a later date. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says the Office for Budget Responsibility did George Osborne a big favour today, by adjusting their forecasts so dramatically: Chote’s team have had another look at their forecasts for likely tax revenues. They have done some modelling. And they have concluded that more money is going to come rolling in to HMRC over the next few years than previously envisaged. To be precise, an extra £2.5bn this year, £4.1bn next year, £6.3bn in 2017-18 and £5.4bn in the year after that. With all this lovely lolly flowing in, Osborne could get himself off the hook on tax credits. Provided, of course, that the tax really does come in on forecast. Chote will clearly be top of the chancellor’s Christmas cards list this year, because it has enabled him to execute a U-turn with the minimum of fuss. It has to be said, though, that the OBR’s forecasts have proved wanting in the past. They could easily be wrong again. “Funny-money forecasts”... “ Sheer brazen cheek”.... A “180-degree body swerve.” Just a few highlights from our expert panel’s verdict - read it all here. The OBR is assuming there will be another delay in the roll-out of universal credit. This is from the OBR’s report. We have added our own forecast judgement of a further six-month delay to the managed migration phase of the [universal credit, or UC] rollout. As usual, we have considered evidence from DWP and the latest assessment of UC rollout by the Major Projects Authority. While this indicates greater confidence in the ‘transition phase’ rollout plan, considerable uncertainty remains over the ‘managed migration’ phase. And of course the transition phase rollout schedule has just been pushed back six months, just a year after the previous delay. And this chart hightlights all the delays that have already occurred. (The line on the left shows what was originally meant to happen, and the lines on the right are the most recent forecasts.) Relieved that (most) tax credits aren’t being cut? Or perhaps you work in a public service whose budget is being cut - or a company being hit by the Apprentice’s Levy? Whatever the case, we’d like to hear how the spending review will affect your life: Not all of the tax credit cuts announced in the summer are being abandoned. The Treasury is still going ahead with a cut to the “income rise disregard” - the amount of extra a tax credit claimant can earn before losing benefits. In July Osborne announced that this was being cut from £5,000 to £2,500. That cut still applies, and it raises £170m. Moody’s, which stripped the UK of its AAA credit rating in 2013, has warned that Britain still faces a big fiscal challenge. Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, says: “While the autumn statement does not fundamentally change our overall view on the UK’s public finances, it again underlines the challenges the government faces in reducing the UK’s large budget deficit and doing so predominantly via spending cuts in a relatively small part of government spending.“ “We still believe that the government will manage to gradually improve its public finances and bring the public debt on a declining trend. That said, the OBR now forecasts a deficit of 2.5% of GDP in 2016/17, compared to 2% of GDP just eight months ago. This is partly due to the statistical reclassification of the housing associations into the public sector, but it also reflects higher departmental spending as some of the planned spending cuts, in particular the tax credit cuts, have been withdrawn.” Moody’s isn’t alarmed by those spending changes, though - as it already expected the government to impose its cuts more slowly than planned. Labour insiders are briefing that John McDonnell’s Little Red Book moment was a humorous aside, in case anyone was confused. They may be rattled by that Conservative attack note, outlining Mao’s record. Labour has strongly criticised the decision to cut Short money. (See 3.11pm.) This is from a party spokesman. This is another anti-democratic move by the Tories. Having already attacked the rights of working people they’re now coming forward with partisan moves to hit their opposition and give themselves another unfair advantage. If the Tories were really serious about cutting the cost of politics they would start with the bill for Tory special advisers which has rocketed under David Cameron. Labour says the bill for government special advisers rose by 35% to £8.4m from 2011-12 to 2013-14, the last year for which figures are available. Average earnings have been revised down partly because the OBR thinks that the apprenticeship levy means firms will have less money for pay rises. This is from the OBR’s report. We have revised average earnings growth lower relative to our July forecast. That partly reflects small adjustments to our productivity growth forecast, but also an assumption that the ongoing costs of auto- enrolment and the introduction of an apprenticeship levy will weigh on earnings growth. These are both economically equivalent to payroll taxes, so – consistent with evidence on the incidence of such taxes – we assume that most of the cost will ultimately be borne by employees. Together, auto-enrolment and the new apprenticeship levy reduce cumulative wage growth over the forecast period by 0.7 per cent. This estimate relies on assumptions about how firms respond to such changes, so is subject to considerable uncertainty. And the OBR report also shows that average earnings have been revised downwards for the next five years (by 0.2% in 2016, then 0.2%, then 0.3%, then 0.4%, and then 0.4%). Back at the OBR briefing, Robert Chote has outlined how the government’s Apprentice Levy will drag wages down this decade: According to the OBR, the level of real household disposable income has been revised down for 2015 by 0.5%. That means the OBR thinks we have had less money to spend this year than it previously assumed. We’ve had two U-turns from the government today - on tax credits, and police funding. And now there’s a third. It is not strictly autumn statement-related, but if you’ve got something embarrassing to announce, why now sneak it out when the nation’s journalists are already working flat out on a budget-scale event. “Burying bad news” it used to be called. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has been resisting calls to go to Acas, the conciliation service, for talks to avert the junior doctors’ strike. The BMA and Labour have been pushing for this, but Hunt said he want the BMA to talk to him first. Now, though, the Department of Health has agreed to go to ACAS. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, is absolutely furious that the government is freezing the student loan repayment threshold, and not uprating it in line with earnings. He says: “This is a disgraceful move and a breach of trust by the government that betrays a generation of students. It has chosen to freeze the repayment threshold even though 95% of the consultation responses did not support the freeze - what was the point of a consultation if when there’s huge objection it does it anyway? According to Lewis, the freeze means 2 million graduates will end up paying £306 more each year by 2020-21 than they would have done without the change. (students must repay 9% of everything they earn above £21,000 (pre-tax salary) once they graduate) Lewis also accuses George Osborne of cowardice, for not mentioning the change in his statement: “It is risking fundamentally threatening any trust people have in the student finance system. It is one thing to set up a system that is unpopular but it is entirely different to make retrospective changes that mean you cannot even rely on what you were promised at the time you started to study. Even though it was warned of the huge dangers of doing this, it’s still blundering ahead, ignoring all right thinking concern. “The fact that the Chancellor didn’t even have the balls to put it in his Autumn Statement speech shows that he knew how unpopular it would be. If a commercial company made retrospective changes to their loan terms in this way they’d be slapped hard by the regulator – the Government shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it either. The government has quietly announced that it is hitting students in the pocket, by not raising the threshold for repaying their loans. The BIS department says: To reduce government debt, the student loan repayment threshold for Plan 2 borrowers will be frozen until April 2021. Plan 2 borrowers are those who took out loans from 2012 onwards. Previously, the threshold for repayments was meant to rise in line with earnings. Labour MP Wes Streeting (a former president of the National Union of Students) says it’s a betrayal, given the government consulted about the move: And here is a Guardian video with Osborne’s best jokes. They don’t miss a trick at CCHQ. Someone has been busy with Wikipedia, and the Tories have just sent out a full-page briefing note about the evils of Chairman Mao, including the claim that 45m Chinese died during the famine caused by Great Leap Forward. Here is the John McDonnell moment they are referring to. Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, is briefing the media now: The BBC has taken the unusual step of resorting to Twitter to invite anyone from Labour to appear on the autumn statement programme. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, says they don’t know whether John McDonnell will turn up. George Osborne announced a new top-up stamp duty, 3% above the current rate, for people buying homes for buy to let. Bad news, if you’ve got the money and plan to splash; the new rate will cover all second homes, not just ones that are being let. This new levy will raise £625m next year, rising to £880m by the end of the parliament. According to the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope, unmarried couples will be able to avoid this. The CBI is also concerned that businesses are being squeezed too hard: The Institute for Directors has sounded the alarm about the government’s new Apprentice Levy. This new scheme puts a tax on firms’ payroll — to fund Britain’s apprenticeship system. Simon Walker, Director General of the IoD, isn’t impressed: “The major business tax announcement of this Autumn Statement was the Apprenticeship Levy, which can only be described as a new payroll tax. At 0.5% of payroll it will be a big new cost for many companies, including medium-sized ones. We are very concerned by the Government’s assumption that a quarter of the money collected will be spent on just administering the levy. Firms have been promised they will get back more than they put in, but it’s not clear how this will happen if so much is being lost in bureaucracy. As flagged earlier, the Levy is expected to raise more than £11bn. And the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted it will lead to “lower nominal wages and profit margins” -- bad news for workers and shareholders. That’s pretty significant for a major retailer such as Tesco: It is often claimed that we don’t have state funding for political parties in the UK. But we do, on a modest level, because opposition parties get so-called Short money (named after Ted Short, a former leader of the Commons) to fund what they do in parliament. Currently this is worth more than £6m a year to Labour, and more than £1m a year to the SNP. All political parties can also get policy development grants, which add up to another £2m a year in total. This money is now being cut. The Tories will lose a bit through the changes to policy development grant funding, but Labour will be hit the hardest. This is from the autumn statement document. Therefore, subject to confirmation by Parliament, the government proposes to reduce Short Money allocations by 19%, in line with the average savings made from unprotected Whitehall departments over this Spending Review. Allocations will then be frozen in cash terms for the rest of the Parliament, removing the automatic RPI indexation. Policy Development Grant allocations will also be reduced by a similar proportion, ensuring that political parties in receipt of taxpayer-funding contribute to the savings being asked of local and central government. Transport has been dealt the biggest cut of any government department as a proportion of its day-to-day spending, with 37% slashed from the DfT’s resource budget by 2020, reports our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham. Most of the savings will come from London. Transport for London’s operational budget of almost £700m a year will be entirely wiped out by the end of the decade, leaving TfL to fund its services through commercial investment, cuts or potentially higher fares. But the chancellor said that transport cuts would be offset by money earmarked for infrastructure funding, up 50% from the last parliament to £61bn over the next six years, including 2020-21. Much of the later spending will go on HS2 - whose price tag has been officially increased to £55.7bn at 2015 prices. Road building will account for £15bn in spending, which George Osborne hailed as the largest road investment programme since the 1970s. London will still receive a total £11bn to continue upgrades and new infrastructure, including Crossrail. The chancellor said the increased capital budget would ensure that critical rail projects such as the electrification of the Midland mainline and Transpennine route can go ahead, after they were shelved earlier this year to outcry in the north. The DfT forecasts that rail franchising will deliver bigger returns to the Treasury than it currently receives. The DfT’s budget will fall from £2.6bn this year to £1.8bn in 2019-20. Its departmental administration budget will be cut by 12% in real terms, a slightly less severe cut than the 18% average across government. The most startling hit for energy and environment in the spending review is £132m pulled from energy efficiency schemes, announced on the day that a huge leap in winter deaths was revealed, says our environment editor Damian Carrington. Osborne sold the change as a £30 cut to consumer bills, but customers in leaky homes will pay much more in the long run. The chancellor also slashed 40% - £700m - from a scheme backing green heating systems, lowering the chances the UK can hit its climate change targets. Meanwhile, heavy industrial energy users got a £20m exemption from green taxes. But Osborne, known as a technology geek, also announced “at least £250m over the next five years in an ambitious nuclear research and development programme that will revive the UK’s nuclear expertise”. This will include a competition to identify the best value “small modular reactor design” - mini-nuke - for the UK, which Osborne said would pave the way to building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s. The £2bn Osborne announced for flood defences is not new and the £1bn Shale Wealth Fund remains theoretical, as no fracking has yet happened. Both the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have taken heavy cuts to day-to-day spending, meaning job losses. For DECC in particular, this is likely to undermine the government’s ability to get the best value for taxpayers in deals with the private sector, such as subsidies for expensive future nuclear power plants. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, claims the decision to protect police budgets is a win for Labour (which has been campaigning on this.) But he says it is not quite as generous as Osborne implied, because police budgets will be protected in cash terms but not in real (ie, inflation adjusted) terms. UPDATE: The Treasury says that is not true. The autumn statement document says: The government will protect overall police spending in real terms over the spending review period, an increase of £900m in cash terms by 2019-20. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the work and pensions committee and who led opposition to the tax credit cuts, is claiming that some families claiming the new universal credit could still lose more than £2,000, the BBC reports. Britain’s fiscal watchdog has admitted that it has underestimating the amount of money brought in through VAT. It has changed the way it models VAT deductions, providing an extra £400m this year - rising to £3.3bn (!) by 2020. The OBR has also changed its modelling for national insurance take, and again, they work out in the government’s favour - with an extra £2.8bn coming in by 2020. Here’s John McDonnell quoting Mao’s Little Red Book. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has just been on the BBC explaining how George Osborne has been able to fund his surprise “good news” announcements. Asked if the sums were credible, Johnson said: [Osborne] has got a bit lucky, in that there are some more tax revenues expected to come in by the OBR. And he’s got a bit lucky because he’s going to be a spending a bit less on debt interest. He has also increased taxes reasonably significantly. There’s a £3bn impost on business to pay for the new apprenticeships. And there are some increases in council tax, probably. And there are some other tax increases there. So he’s done two things. He has taken advantage of increased revenues and reduced spending on debt interest. He’s increased taxes a bit. And he’s essentially used most of that money to damp down the cuts in spending. And because those cuts in spending were on a relatively limited part of government, the effect of that bit of extra money is to significantly reduce the overall level of cuts. The OBR has revised up its forecast for income tax and national insurance contributions this parliament by almost £15bn. That has helped to chancellor to stick to his deficit reduction targets despite raising spending - so there could be problems if they’re wrong... It’s official, the cap doesn’t fit. The Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that the government will fall into its welfare cap trap several times. It says: Our central forecast shows that the terms of the welfare cap are set to be breached in three successive years from 2016-17 to 2018-19, with the net effect of policy measures raising welfare cap spending in each of those years, and to well above the 2 per cent forecast margin in 2016-17 and 2017-18. The terms of the cap are set to be observed by very small margins in 2019-20 and 2020-21, with spending above the cap but within the forecast margin and with the net effect of measures in those years reducing spending. The OBR has calculated that today’s measures will raise gross tax take by £28.5bn by 2020. It says: These include the new apprenticeship levy (£11.6 billion), higher council tax (£6.2 billion), and the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty land tax for second homes and buy-to-let purchases (£3.8 billion). That’s a major tax hit on businesses, who are being forced to take on the cost of creating millions of extra apprentices. This chart shows how tax changes (in yellow) will pull down the deficit, while public spending changes (in grey) will push it up (as well the u-turn on tax credits). Today’s detailed forecasting by the OBR has some grim news for John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, by warning that income from taxes controlled by the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh are likely to be lower than it thought. Raising fresh questions about the Scottish government’s future finances, the OBR forecasts that tax income from Swinney’s flagship replacement for stamp duty, introduced on new house sales earlier this year, will be 20% lower over the next six years than it predicted in July. The OBR estimates revenues from the new land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) will be £926m lower by 2021, contributing directly to a £485m fall in overall tax receipts for the Scottish government compared to the OBR’s forecast in July. Holyrood will start to take nearly complete control over income tax in Scotland from April 2016 – helping it raise some £6bn a year by 2021. But the OBR now believes that based on current tax rates, Scotland’s income tax receipts will only rise by 0.7% compared to its July forecast. Here is a quick round-up of what political journalists and writers are saying about John McDonnell on Twitter. Mostly they are not complimentary. (The consolation for McDonnell is that it does not really matter. Almost all the media focus today will be on Osborne.) From the Times’s Patrick Kidd From the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves From the Guardian’s Rafeal Behr From Sky News’s Faisal Islam From the Spectator’s Isabel Hardman From the FT’s Jim Pickard From the author Robert Harris From Newsnight’s Allegra Stratton The Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that it has raised its forecast for tax receipts, allowing George Osborne to ease back on austerity. In the first combined Spending Review and Autumn Statement since 2007, the Government has taken advantage of an improvement in the outlook for tax receipts – concentrated in the middle years of this Parliament – to further loosen the impending squeeze on public services spending, to increase capital spending and to reverse the main tax credit cuts it announced in July, while still delivering a modestly stronger budget balance in most years on a like-for- like basis. As the boost to receipts begins to ebb, the Government increases departmental spending by less and relies more on tax increases to maintain the bottom line improvement. There is still a major squeeze on departments, though -- Osborne’s latest cuts are roughly than a third smaller on average than those delivered over the last Parliament. But in aggregate, the OBR says the chancellor is actually spending more than he’s getting in from the improved fiscal outlook: Taken together with the other measures in the Autumn Statement, the Government has announced a net fiscal giveaway of £6.2 billion next year, more than half of which is the cost of reversing the tax credit cut. This outweighs a £2.9 billion improvement in the underlying forecast in that year and thereby pushes up the deficit. McDonnell is still speaking. He says this statement was part of Osborne’s leadership bid. The statement will be seen as the apex of Osborne’s career, he says. He describes Osborne as Icarus - flying too close to the sun. He says Labour’s advocates investment instead. It wants high skills, high investment, and high wages. That is what Labour will secure when it returns to office, he says. And that McDonnell response is over. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is responding to George Osborne now. Having to respond to statements of this kind is the hardest task any parliamentarian ever has to undertake (because the opposition gets no advance warning of what is in these statements) and no one ever really triumphs in this role. McDonnell started by taunting Osborne for the fact that he failed completely to cut the deficit in one parliament as he promised in 2010. McDonnell’s argument was sound, although his attempt to lecture the Tories on deficit reduction and economic credibility prompted laughing from the government benches. McDonnell is going through cuts in the announcement now. He says that he Department for Business is almost being closed down, and that the solar energy industry is being killed off. He says he never expected to be outdone in nationalisation by Osborne. He says he, McDonnell, wants to nationalise rail. But Osborne wants to sell British assets to Chinese state companies. McDonnell brandishes a copy of Mao’s Little Red Book, and he quotes from it: “We must learn to do economic work from all, no matter who they are.” He thought this advice would come in handy for Osborne, McDonnell says. He says this is not an economic plan but a political fix. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s new Economic and fiscal outlook is online too. Now we can see the details of today’s figures.... Economic and fiscal outlook – November 2015 The Spending Review and Autumn Statement are online here. John McDonnell has just stood up to respond to George Osborne. He has got quite a task, because there were some genuine political surprises there, as well as at least two leaps into Labourish territory. Quite how Osborne will fund his “good news announcements” is a total mystery, on the basis of what Osborne said, but after a few hours with the red book we should find out. But Osborne does probably deserve some credit for abandoning his tax credits completely, instead for opting for a fudge. If you are going to do a U-turn, you may well do one properly, and Osborne pulled this off with some aplomb. His announcement on police funding was a real surprise too (although we need to see the small print). More interesting were the apprenticeship levy - a £3bn tax on big business, not unlike Gordon Brown’s 1997 windfall tax, and more ambitious than anything Labour proposed at the election - and the punitive 3% stamp duty for buy to let landlords, another move that sounds Jeremy Corbyn than Ed Balls. Here’s Heather Stewart on today’s Autumn Statement: George Osborne has executed a complete U-turn on his controversial cuts to tax credits, as he delivered what he called, “a big spending review from a government that does big things”. Osborne had promised to modify the plans, which would have seen 3m low-income families lose an average of £1,000 a year, after they were rejected by the House of Lords, and criticised by Conservative backbenchers. Delivering his combined autumn statement and spending review, the chancellor said higher than expected tax revenues and lower interest payments on government debt had opened up an extra £27bn of fiscal wriggle-room, which would allow him to cancel the £4.4bn cuts altogether..... You always expect a few white rabbits from George Osborne. But this time, the Office for Budget Responsibility handed the chancellor a plump bunny, with better growth forecasts despite recent signs of weakness in the global economy. And that means the chancellor has wrong footed City economists who expected slightly worse deficit figures today. Low global interest rates have probably cut the bill for servicing the national debt. The OBR must also be more optimistic about tax receipts - despite the surprise fall in October. That adds up to an unexpected windfall for the chancellor, allowing him to stick to that surplus target in this parliament and also avoid cuts to the police. But the axe has still swung elsewhere. The OBR are releasing its latest economic and fiscal forecasts now, so we’ll soon be able to see the details [it’s also complicated by reclassifications to the national debt]. Past history shows that the statement may look less rosy under closer examination.... The spending cuts outlined today mean the chancellor is persevering with a Thatcher-style reshaping of the UK economy, cutting the state: And while the the tax credit u-turn will be welcomed by poorer workers, let’s not forget that pensioners can also look forward to more money - thanks to the ‘triple-lock’. Osborne says the Tories were elected as one nation government. And they are governing as such, he says, as “the mainstream representatives of the working people of Britain”. Osborne says the counter-terrorism budget is going up 30%. Osborne says some people have said police budgets should be cut by 10%. (This is a reference to Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, who said the police could live with cuts of 10%.) But he disagrees, he says. Police budgets will not be cut, Osborne says. Osborne says the police protect us, so we will protect them. Is the party over for buy-to-let landlords? Newsnight’s Duncan Weldon suggests so: Conservative backbencher David Davis (former shadow home secretary) has also given Osborne the thumbs-up: Osborne turns to security. It is in the national interest to spend on aid, he says. Aid budget to rise to £16.3bn by the end of the parliament. The Foreign Office’s budget to be protected. Osborne turns to house building. Some details of his plans emerged overnight. He says he wants to do much more than in the past. Housing budget to be doubled, to £2bn a year. This will fund 400,000 new affordable homes by the end of the decade - affordable to buy, not just to rent. Help to Buy shared ownership will relax the rules around shared ownership, ensuring more people can take advantage. From tonight the tenants of five housing associations will be able to exercise their right to buy. London Help to Buy will allow people in the capital to get a loan to help buy a home. A new stamp duty rate for people buying homes as buy to let will be 3% higher than normal stamp duty. The revenue will be reinvested back in local communities. We are the builders, Osborne says, using the slogan he used in his party conference speech. Osborne says under-used courts will be closed. The £700m saved will be used to introduce new technology into the court service. Nine new prisons to be built. Holloway prison, the biggest women’s prison in Western Europe, will close, he says. The women will serve their time in more modern prisons. Osborne turns to apprenticeships. The apprenticeship levy to raise £3bn a year. It will be set at 0.5% of the payroll bill. But there will be a £15,000 allowance, so 98% of employers will not pay. Part-time students will be able to receive maintenance loans, Osborne says. Osborne says the arbitrary schools funding system will be replaced. He commends MPs from all parties who have campaign for this. New school funding system to come into force from 2017. Nicky Morgan to launch a consultation on the new funding formula next year, he says. Osborne says sixth form colleges will be able to become academies, so they do not have to pay VAT. Councils running schools will become a thing of the past. Schools funding will increase by £10bn. Osborne says free school meals and the pupil premium will be maintained. He says the national citizen service will be expanded. By the end of the decade, there will be places for 300,000 students. Osborne says the government is making the largest ever investment in free childcare. It will be available from 2017. But it will only be available to families working a certain number of hours per week. The Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Owen Smith, warns that low-income households on Universal Credit are still vulnerable: Osborne says sound public finances can help the most disadvantaged. Inequality is down, and child poverty is down, he says. The other side talks of social justice; the Conservatives deliver it, he says. Osborne says this is similar to the way Libor fines are used to help service charities. He names various ones that will benefit from Libor money, including the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust. And there will be a memorial for the victims of 7/7. Osborne says there are many charities that support vulnerable women. Some 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for the removal of the tampon tax. The government wants to change EU law so it can abolish that altogether. But, until then, the £15m raised from the tax will go to women’s charities, he says. Osborne says cuts in arts funding are a false economy. The DCMS’s administrative budget will be cut by 20%. But the Arts Council’s budget will be protected, and free museum entry will be maintained. He says Alan Johnson has lobbied him for money for Hull’s year of culture. He will oblige, he says. He says Johnson has contributed to arts, while his front bench has contributed to comedy. Osborne says the Department for Business budget is being cut by 17%. In the last parliament the budget for science was protected in cash terms. In this parliament it will be protected in real terms, he says. The Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge will be transformed. Paul Nurse, a Nobel laureate, has just published a report into research laboratories. Its recommendations will be published. Professor Geraint Johnes, Professor of Economics at Lancaster University, tells us: “New freedoms have been given to councils to realise income generated through sales of property. Useful, but can only be done once.” Osborne says the small business rate relief scheme is being extended for another year. Osborne says support for climate finance is being increased. A new energy scheme will save £30 a year from the energy bills of 30m households, he says. The rules affecting the compensation culture around minor motor industries are changing. That should cut car insurance, he says. Osborne says Defra’s budget is falling by 15%. But there will be £2bn for flood defences. Mentioning forestry, he says the government will not be making them mistake of trying to privatise them again. And the government will carry on with the scheme that cuts South West Water bills by £50. Osborne says Britain topped the league table of best places in the world to invest in infrastructure spending in a survey last week. Department for Transport spending will be cut by 37%, he says. But its capital spending will go up by around 50%. And London will get an £11bn investment in transport infrastructure. Kent will also get £250m to deal with the problems associated with Operation Stack. Mary Ann Seighart, who chairs the Social Market Foundation, isn’t impressed by Osborne’s plan to allow local councils to sell off surplus properties to fund day-to-day spending: Osborne says he wants a deal for Scotland that is fair and fit to last. If Scotland had voted for independence, it would have its own spending review this autumn. With oil revenues down by around 90%, there would have been catastrophic cuts. But luckily that was avoided, he says. Osborne says Northern Ireland’s block grant will be over £11bn by the end of this parliament. And he says he is giving a funding floor to Wales, set at 115%. And the government will legislate so the Welsh assembly can get powers over income tax without a referendum. Welsh assembly to get powers over income tax without needing a referendum. Osborne says local government is sitting on property worth £250bn. So councils will be able to keep 100% of the receipts from the assets they sell, he says. By the end of this parliament local government will be spending the same in cash terms as it does today. Osborne turns to his northern powerhouse vision, and his plans to devolve power to local authorities. Some 26 new or extended enterprise zones are being created, he says. As he said at the Tory conference, he is abolishing the uniform national business rates. Power over business rates will be devolved. Osborne says the new rate for the basic state pension will be £155.65. Osborne says the basic state pension will increase by £3.35 a week next year, to £119.30 a week. On Twitter Rupert Harrison, Osborne’s former chief of staff, has explained why Osborne abandoned the tax credit cuts. Labour MP Alison McGovern, of Wirral South, credits tax credit campaigners: Osborne turns to social care. He says he is increasing the better care fund, to help the integration of health and social care. By the end of this parliament health and social care spending will have risen, he says. Osborne turns to mental health, and he praises Andrew Mitchell, Norman Lamb and Alastair Campbell for their campaigning on this. Mental health will get an extra £600m. Osborne says Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, says the NHS is being funded appropriately. NHS funding to rise from £101bn this year to £120bn by 2020-21. One of the Conservative rebels over tax credits, Stephen McPartland of Stevenage, has welcomed the decision to abandon the cuts Osborne says the NHS is the first priority of the government, and the British people. Health spending was cut by the Labour administration in Wales. But under the Tories it is rising in England, he says. Osborne says there is currently a cap on the number of student nurses. That cap will be abolished, and student nurses will have to apply for loans. Osborne says day to day spending in government departments is set to fall by an average of 0.8% a year in real terms. The government is still spending £4 trillion over the next five years, he says. Osborne says the cuts are half what they were in the last parliament. Osborne says total managed expenditure - the government’s total spending - will be £756bn this year, rising to £773bn next year, £787bn the year after, £801bn in 2018-19 and £821bn in 2019-20. Osborne says government spending was 45% of GDP in 2010. Now it is just under 40%. But the end of the spending review period it will be down to 36.5%. At that level it is affordable, he says. Osborne turns to tax avoidance measures. The government will build one of the most digitally advanced tax systems in the world. Everyone will have digital tax accounts by the end of this parliament, he says. And that means capital gains tax will have to be paid quickly. The cost of Whitehall administration will be cut by £1.9bn, he says. Osborne turns to the deficit forecast. Deficit forecast to be 3.9% this year, falling to 2.5% in 2016-17, 1.2% in 2017-18, and 0.2% in 2018-19. In 2019-20 there will be a surplus of 0.5%, followed by one of 0.6% the following year. Osborne says he can help with tax credits. People have argued the cuts should be phased in. But the simplest thing is to avoid them altogether. Osborne abandons tax credit cuts. He says they are being phased out anyway when the universal credit comes in. Osborne confirms that this mean the welfare cap will be breached in the early years of the parliament. But it will be met in the later years of the parliament, he says. Osborne says he has cut his borrowing plans by £8bn. And he will be able to achieve a surplus by cutting less, he says. Debt forecast to be 81.7% next year, 79.9% in 2017-18, 77.3% in 2018-19, 74.3% in 2019-20 and 71.3% in 2020-21. Osborne says housing associations have been brought onto the public balance sheet. That statistical change will be backdated to 2008. The OBR has produced new forecasts. Debt was meant to be 83.6% this year, he says. On the new measure, it is 82.5%, he says. Those growth forecasts mean the UK should grow a little faster than expected in the next two years, before slowing towards the end of the decade: 2015: 2.4%, matching the 2.4% predicted in July’s Budget 2016: 2.4%, up from 2.3% 2017: 2.5%, up from 2.4% 2018: 2.4%, matching the Budget forecast 2019: 2.3%, down from 2.4% Osborne says he is still committed to delivering a surplus in 2019-20. The OBR has approved the forecast. Osborne says Labour claims about the government plans have been proved wrong. The OBR says the economy will grow robustly every year, and living standards will rise every year. OBR says 1m jobs will be created over the next five years, Osborne says. Osborne reads out the growth forecast. Growth forecast to be 2.4% this year, 2.4% in 2016, 2.5% in 2017, 2.4% in 2018, and 2.3% in 2019 and 2020. Osborne says the OBR says debts are too high, and the deficit remains. Expectations for world growth and world trade have been revised down. That is why it is important to protect economic security. Osborne is turning to the new OBR forecasts. Since 2010, no economy in the G10 has grown faster than Britain. That growth has not been fuelled by an irresponsible banking boom, he says. The north has grown faster than the south. This will be a recovery for all, he says. The strongest job growth is not just in the capital, but in the Midlands, which is creating jobs three times faster than London and the south east. Osborne says he will extend opportunities for all. This is a big spending review, by a government that does “big things”, he says. Osborne says the £12bn of welfare savings will be delivered in full, “and delivered in a way that helps families as we make the progression to a national living wage”. Osborne says he is committed to a surplus. His plans will deliver that, he says. And he will bring debt down. This year debt will fall, and it will keep falling in every year, he says. Osborne says five years ago the economy was in crisis. As Labour’s letter said, there was no money left. Then the job was to rescue Britain. Now it is to rebuild Britain. Osborne says the spending review (SR) will put security first. Economic and national security provide the foundations for everthing the government wants to support, he says. We are tracking all the key points from the chancellor’s statement here: George Osborne, the chancellor, is just about to start his statement. It should last for almost an hour. This is what Cameron said at the start of PMQs about Chris Martin. Everyone in this House and many people watching at home know from Yes Prime Minister the central role that Bernard, the Prime Minister’s Principal PPS plays in the life of the Prime Minister and of Number 10 Downing Street. Well this morning my Bernard, my Principal Private Secretary died of cancer, Chris Martin was only 42. He was one of the most loyal, hardworking, dedicated public servants that I’ve ever come across. I’ve no idea what his politics were but he would go to the ends of the earth and back again for his Prime Minister, for Number 10, and for the team he worked for. Today we’re leaving the seat in the Officials’ Box where he used to sit empty as a mark of respect to him. We think of his wife Zoe, his family, the wider Number 10 family because it is a bit like a family and we feel we’ve lost someone between a father and a brother to all of us, and whatever happens we will never forget him. Cameron says we will be hearing more about the infrastructure plan soon. In a Guardian article, my colleague Juliette Jowit explains why people should be sceptical about government infrastructure plan announcements. Here’s an extract. Chancellor George Osborne has promised to put people such as Dave at the heart of his spending review on Wednesday, when he will unveil plans to spend £100bn in this parliament on new infrastructure: roads, railways, power stations and smart meters, flood defences and broadband. But there should be widespread suspicion of the pledge. Osborne has published national infrastructure plans every year since 2010. These and the latest plan underpin the chancellor’s central themes: that he is investing to create jobs and wealth, giving his party the right to be trusted by voters with the economy. Analysis of these plans by the Guardian, however, shows these promises are artificially inflated by rising prices, changes to the rules and a host of expensive but still uncertain schemes. In reality, government spending on infrastructure fell in the last parliament. David Cameron began PMQs with the very sad news that his principal private secretary, Chris Martin, died of cancer today. He was just 42. In a moving tribute, the PM compared Chris Martin to ‘Bernard” of Yes Prime Minister, saying he was: One of the most loyal, hard working, dedicated public servants I have ever come across. He would go to “the ends of the earth and back again” for his team, and he’ll never be forgotten, Cameron added. Jeremy Corbyn also paid tribute, saying Chris Martin has played a valuable role when Labour was in power too (he served as Press Secretary to both Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling.) More tributes are coming in: David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn both paid tribute earlier to Chris Martin, Cameron’s principle private secretary, who died this morning at the age of 42. The news has prompted Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, to post on Twitter. PMQs - Snap verdict: A relatively low key exchange, but Corbyn chose two subjects where Cameron was vulnerable and he scored some modest hits (although he could probably have pushed Cameron harder about the Rudd leak). Cameron clearly felt a little frustrated about not being able to say more about the domestic violence announcement coming in the autumn statement, but he and Corbyn both know that what they said will be soon forgotten in the light of the big announcements coming shortly. Corbyn says today is the international day for the elimination of violence against women. Why are one third of those referred to English refuges being turned away? Cameron says the government has put more money into refuges, and that Osborne will say more about that in his statement. Corbyn quotes a domestic charity worker saying domestic violence victims have a right to the best treatment. The government signed the Istanbul convention making the right to women’s services statutory. When will the government ratify that? Cameron says the government is going further. He says Osborne will address this in his statement. No government before this one has a stronger record, he says. Corbyn says a UN chief scientist has said Britain has gone backwards on renewable energy. Cameron says he does not accept that. When the cost of renewable energy falls, subsidies should fall too. Otherwise the cost of energy to taxpayers rises. He also says he his building the first nuclear power station for a long time. Corbyn says 1,000 jobs have gone from solar panel firms. He reads out a question from a solar panel apprentice asking why Cameron is throwing away the progress made in this area. Cameron says more than 1m homes were fitted with solar panels in the last parliament. But the cost has fallen, so the subsidies should fall too, he says. Jeremy Corbyn says 55 Labour councils have made a commitment to run their areas on green energy by 2050. Will Cameron commend them, and urge Conservative councils to do the same. Cameron says he wants to promote green energy. He will be taking part in the Paris climate talks. But action must be taken locally as well, he says. In the last parliament there was a trebling of the introducing of renewable energy. Corbyn says Cameron used to say his was the greenest government ever. Does Cameron agree with Amber Rudd that the government will miss its renewable energy target for 2020? Cameron says his last government was the greenest government ever. It also helped other countries go green. He ignores the point about Amber Rudd completely. Fiona Bruce, a Conservative, asks if the announcements in today’s autumn statement will pass Cameron’s “family test” (ie, that they should support families). Cameron says George Osborne will have something to say about families later. David Cameron is now taking prime minister’s questions. I will just be focusing on the exchanges with Jeremy Corbyn, and any autumn statement-related material. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says we could hear pension tax relief changes for top earners, and a potential increase in fuel duty: Rumours are rife with news that Osborne will be stopping higher earners from cashing in on pension tax relief before he reforms the way this works next Spring. Hopefully he’ll step up to the plate and sort out the pension exit fees that are punishing over 55’s that take advantage of his new pension freedoms rise too. While he’s likely to back peddle on his tax credit reforms, he could end up hitting the same households if he targets housing benefit instead. A trip to the pump this morning could be worth your while as a fuel duty hike seems inevitable. Petrol and diesel prices are the lowest we’ve seen for a long time so drivers should expect a second shock after already swallowing the £13 av. increase in insurance premium tax. Evgeny Lebedev, who owns the Evening Standard, looks as if he has just tweeted an autumn statement announcement. And George Osborne has been tweeting ahead of his statement too. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has tweeted about the autumn statement. Torsten Bell, a former Treasury civil servant and Labour adviser who now runs the Resolution Foundation, has this take on the importance of autumn statements. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is surprisingly sceptical about the plans that George Osborne is due to announce for 400,000 new homes. This is from Jeremy Blackburn, the RICS head of policy. A push towards affordable home ownership should not come at the expense of affordable homes for rent. If cities such as London are to thrive, we need to ensure that housing can be provided for all of its workforce - home ownership can only go so far and even shared ownership may prove too expensive for some. We would like to see the chancellor incentivise affordable homes for rent in both public and private sectors. George Osborne is essentially subsidising one sector of the housing market over all others, in an area that already benefits from significant Government funding. Although the announcement is on the face of it encouraging for certain sectors, the devil will be in the detail. Anyone got any spare metallic paint? George Osborne has just left the Treasury (no, not permanently), and hopped into his limo for the short journey to parliament: Fingers crossed that we avoid a second prang. Lord Porter, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association, has told the Guardian in an interview that some councils could effectively go bust if the cuts in the spending review are as deep as expected. Britain’s barristers are worried that the justice system could be imperilled if the chancellor swings the axe in its direction today. Chairman of the Bar Council, Alistair MacDonald QC says: “It is because citizens have access to justice that big businesses pay their small firm suppliers in good time, that parents can get the right pay and leave from their employers, and that elderly people get the care to which they are entitled. “The idea that people who need to use the courts are being subsidised by the tax-payer is completely wrong. When people use the courts and other legal avenues to enforce the law, it helps to ensure that we all play by the rules. Without access to justice, everyone will suffer because the rules will cease to matter.” Our colleague Martin Kettle has written a piece this morning saying we would be better off just abolishing autumn statements and spending reviews. Here’s an extract. There is a very strong case for saying that both rituals are largely unnecessary and that, in particular, they allow the Treasury and the chancellor to get far too tough a grip on the government’s strategy and approach. While accepting that today’s speech and announcements are indisputably important as framing exercises, it is also important to stress that they don’t need to be treated as respectfully as they are. In short, we might be better off without either of them. But surely we have to have them? No we don’t. Unlike the annual budget, the autumn statement and the spending review are recent inventions: the autumn statement dates from 1976; the spending review only from 1998. Neither of them is an ordained or ancient part of the way UK government works. The autumn statement is a purely political confection. It has no economic purpose. It exists primarily to allow the chancellor to command a second big parliamentary event of the year (indeed this is the third of 2015, in which Osborne has already delivered two budgets, one of them only four months ago). In essence the same applies to the spending review, which was invented by Gordon Brown ostensibly to give the appearance of having a sensible long-term economic strategy. It succeeded in that political aim, though the strategy didn’t turn out as cleverly as Brown claimed and most observers accepted at the time. In reality, the spending review was conjured up to enable Brown to bind all his rival departmental ministers into decisions from which they could not escape. The spending review is about the assertion of political power — the chancellor’s power — not economic strategy. Here is Patrick Wintour’s full story on how the government is planning to breach its welfare cap. There was a slight prang in Downing Street earlier. Bad omen? If George Osborne does breach the welfare cap it will be all the more remarkable because even Jeremy Corbyn said he accepted it; he said so in an interview to the New Statesman in September. Here are some pictures of ministers arriving and leaving Number 10 for today’s autumn statement cabinet meeting. Theresa May, the home secretary, is braced for cuts - and did not look overly cheerful. Health is getting more money, which may be why Jeremy Hunt looked more upbeat. The Department for Business is expecting cuts. Here’s Sajid Javid, the business secretary, and Priti Patel, the employment minister. God knows what’s happening to the small business budget, but Anna Soubry, the small business minister, looks like she’s had a shock. Unlike David Cameron who looks, well, as smug as ever ... Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabians, has blogged about how breaching the welfare cap would ‘liberate’ the chancellor: it was Osborne’s pre-election promise of £12 billion of cuts to welfare that really did the damage and led inexorably to the tax credit reforms. First Osborne made the welfare pledge, then he protected pensioners and the severely disabled, and finally he realised that a Tory-only Treasury could not impose cash cuts on the very worst off who are not in work. There was no choice left but to hit the working poor. It is sometimes said that George Osborne never expected to implement the £12bn promise. It was designed only as a negotiating position in advance of post-election coalition talks. Whatever the truth in that, now the chancellor must let it go and cancel the cuts planned for existing tax credit claimants. And that also means increasing the value of the ‘welfare cap’, Osborne’s self-imposed straightjacket which he tightened at the last Budget and he can now loosen again. Ditching the welfare pledge would be liberating, because if Osborne scraps that one promise he will suddenly have lots of options before him. More here: The welfare pledge: Osborne is a prisoner of his own imagination Does every u-turn have a silver lining? Nick Clegg’s former special advisor, Polly Mackenzie, reckons it might: . Rupert Harrison used to be George Osborne’s chief of staff. He is working in the City now, and using Twitter to advise people not to be taken in by Treasury “expectation management” ahead of the autumn statement. Jonathan Portes also hopes that the welfare cap might be dropped altogether: The Welfare Cap shows the dangers of ‘soundbite’ driven fiscal policy, argues economist Jonathan Portes, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research: One of the criticisms of George Osborne as chancellor is that he can be too clever by half, that some of his political schemes are so devious that they can backfire. For anyone advancing this theory, the welfare cap now looks like an ideal example. Osborne announced a welfare cap, a cap on the overall amount the government can spend on certain welfare payments, in the budget of 2014. It is not the same as the benefits cap, the cap on the amount of benefits that an out-of-work family can receive (originally £26,000, but now being cut to £20,000 for families outside London.) The benefits cap proved remarkably popular with voters, and so Osborne decided to apply the same principle to overall welfare spending. At the time it was perceived primarily as a trap for Labour; Osborne was hoping that the opposition would vote against, thus allowing him to depict them as profligate with welfare spending. In the event this ploy failed, because Ed Miliband and Ed Balls decided their party should vote in favour of the welfare cap, and the issue quickly dropped out of the political headlines. As a restraint on government the welfare cap was always relatively ineffective because, under Osborne’s proposal, any government could break i and spend more if it wanted to. But it would have to go to the Commons to win approval in a vote. Osborne argued that this would prove embarrassing, and that the unappetising prospect of having to ask MPs to vote for extra welfare spending would act as a deterrent. In the debate on the welfare cap in March 2014 he said that breaching the welfare cap would be “a failure of public expenditure control”. Any chancellor taking this step would have to admit that what they really want is “higher welfare bills”, he said. The charter makes clear what will happen if the welfare cap is breached. The chancellor must come to parliament, account for the failure of public expenditure control, and set out the action that will be taken to address the breach ... The welfare cap brings responsibility, accountability and fairness. Those who want to undo our welfare reforms will now have to tell us about the other cuts that they will make, or else come clean and admit to the public that what they really want are higher welfare bills .. From now on, any government who want to spend more on welfare will have to be honest with the public—honest about the costs—and secure the approval of parliament in order to breach the cap. Expect those words to be flung back at Osborne this afternoon. Now it seems that he is going to have to go to parliament himself and admit that he’s the one asking for “higher welfare bills” because he’s failed to meet his own spending targets. The news that George Osborne is planning to breach his own welfare cap is causing a stir on Twitter: Financial Times political correspondent John McDermott says Osborne still has a little ‘wiggle room’, though: Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MPs for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, predicts two u-turns from the chancellor, on the welfare cap and on the 2020 budget surplus. George Osborne has set in train plans to breach the Treasury’s welfare cap after deciding it cannot find enough welfare savings to compensate for the decision to slow the pace of cuts to tax credits. The chancellor has held discussions with the Department of Work and Pensions to arrange a Commons vote that would give the government permission to breach the cap. The vote will be passed by MPs but the decision is likely to be seen as a political embarrassment for Osborne since he largely invented the self imposed cap in the last parliament as a trap to show Labour is lax on welfare spending. In the end the shadow chancellor Ed Balls embraced the cap. The request to the DWP suggests that cuts to housing benefit likely to be found in Wednesday’s Autumn Statement will fall short of the £4.4 bn that would have been saved by changing the threshold of tax credit payments. Osborne has many options to mitigate the impact of the tax credits and some would not require him to bust his plan to have the budget in overall annual surplus by the end of the parliament, probably the single biggest target he has set himself. Osborne, speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme on Sunday referred to the need to go back to parliament if we was to breach the welfare cap, but he was not pressed on whether he intended to do so. Overnight it emerged that housing will be a big focus in the autumn statement. As the Guardian splash reveals, George Osborne will commit himself to “the biggest affordable housebuilding programme since the 1970s – with over 400,000 new homes built across England”. Labour has dismissed this as hot air. This is from John Healey, the shadow housing minister. If hot air built homes, then Conservative ministers would have our housing crisis sorted. A matter of weeks ago the housing minister promised a million more homes, now George Osborne is saying they’ll build 400,000 more. George Osborne’s first act as chancellor in 2010 was to slash housing investment by 60%, and his plans today could still mean 40% less to build the homes we need compared to the investment programme he inherited from Labour. The Tories’ housing record speaks for itself. The lowest peacetime level of housebuilding since David Lloyd George was prime minister in the 1920s, home ownership fallen year-on-year to the lowest level in a generation, and alongside the lowest number of genuinely affordable homes built in two decades, the number of affordable homes to buy halved since 2010. The Centre for Economics and Business Research believes George Osborne could be facing a £30bn ‘black hole’ in his budget forecasts. Like many economists, the CEBR believes this year’s deficit will be higher than the £69.5bn forecast. But it also reckons that economic growth will be weaker than expected - leaving the UK with a deficit of almost £20bn in 2020, not the £10bn surplus currently pencilled in. The Cebr explains: “Because the Chancellor’s forecasts rely on an implausibly high rate of growth we think that the Government’s fiscal position is much less favourable than was set out in the July Budget. “The deficit will not be eliminated in the current Parliament.” That chimes with the IFS’s warning early this morning, although it doesn’t expect major revisions to growth forecasts today. Shares in Britain’s house builders are rallying this morning, on the back of reports that the chancellor will pledge an extra £7bn of fresh investment in housing. Trader have pushed Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard: Osborne is expected to promise 400,000 new homes, to “turn generation rent into generation buy”. The trick to successful trap-laying is to make damn sure that you lure your quarry, rather than falling into it. But Sky’s Faisal Islam believes that George Osborne may have snared himself with his decision to cap Britain’s welfare bill. He’s doesn’t appear to have left himself any margin to change course on tax credits, without pushing up the bill. Faisal explains: The problem arises because Mr Osborne, in addition to making sharp welfare cuts, chose to push down the welfare cap to the levels of welfare spending forecast in July by the Office for Budget Responsibility - £115bn in the 2016/17 financial year. This means there is no wriggle room for a significantly more generous phasing of tax credits in the coming year without busting the cap. The OBR assesses compliance with the welfare cap under the Charter for Budget Responsibility at every Autumn Statement. The policy was designed as a trap for Labour, but the Chancellor would appear to have been caught in it himself. “It’ll be breached ... he’s not going to get it for next year,” said one Westminster source. Under Osborne’s original plans to cut tax credits by £4.4bn, the Resolution Foundation said that 3.3m families would lose on average £1,300 a year. According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, under the revised plans families earning around £20,000 a year could now lose “only” around £300 a year. The inverted commas around that “only” are important; the problem for Osborne is that the sums involved in the original cuts were so enormous that, even if he takes substantial steps to lessen their impact, they will probably still hammer the blue-collar, inwork “strivers” that the Tories claim to represent. You can also get up to speed on today’s events with our Q&amp;A on the spending review, explaining which departments could be hit hardest: Katie Allen has pulled together the most important charts to explain today’s autumn statement: It shows how Britain has rarely achieved a budget surplus. The last one was back in 2001: The most influential commentator on the autumn statement, by a mile, is the director of the tax and spending thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies. As all chancellors have discovered in recent years, if you can persuade the IFS that your numbers stack up, in the court of informed opinion you’ve won, regardless of what the opposition or anyone else has to say. But if the IFS is critical, you’re in trouble. The current head of the IFS is Paul Johnson and he was on the Today programme this morning. He made two key points. Johnson said that Osborne’s goal of running a surplus of £10bn by 2019-20 would be “close to impossible” to achieve if the economy underperformed. [Osborne] set himself a really tough target to get to this surplus in 2019, and the problem with this target is it’s very much unlike the targets he set himself in the last parliament; it is fixed and inflexible. So if it turns out that the economy does even a little worse than he’s expecting over the next few years, I think it will be close to impossible to meet unless he’s going to put some tax increases in place. If the economy pans out as he currently expects, and tax revenues come in as he expects, it might be just about reachable but only at the cost of really big cuts in things like the Home Office, local government and other departments. He said that in economic terms it would not matter much if Osborne missed the 2019-20 deadline for running a budget surplus. There is a reasonable case to be made for getting into surplus at some point because that increases the rate at which we pay down the debt we have, which is currently around 80% of national income which is quite a high level. But whether he meets that target in 2019 or 2020 or 2021 doesn’t matter terribly much from an economic point of view. From an economic point of view, even if you want to get into surplus and stay there, the speed in which you do it doesn’t matter that much, as much as getting there within some period. The latest borrowing forecasts are unlikely to bring much cheer. The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to revise UP its forecast for the deficit this financial year, from £69.5bn to perhaps £74bn. That’s because last month’s public finance figures were alarmingly poor, with Britain borrowing more than at any time since 2009 to cover weak tax revenues. So while this year’s deficit (the black line above) will still be lower than last year (the blue line), it might be several billion pounds higher than we were promised in the budget. That’s a blow to a chancellor who has welded his reputation to the cause of deficit reduction. It also gives George Osborne less wriggle room to soften austerity, if he remains committed to balancing the books his parliament. And crucially, the OBR (Britain’s fiscal watchdog) might conclude that borrowing will be higher in future years too. That would put Osborne’s goal of a £10bn surplus in 2019-20 in doubt. Although tax credits could dominate the headlines, economists are looking for some other measures to stimulate growth. We already know that the chancellor is planning to boost housebuilding, to address Britain’s affordable housing crisis. Businesses will be crossing their fingers that the government shakes up business rates; many are paying rates based on property values before the 2008 crash. Infrastructure spending - a perennial favourite. The chancellor will surely bang the drum for the Northern Powerhouse, while Labour’s John McDonnell will rebut that the UK is still spending less than the 3.5% of GDP which the OECD recommends Drivers have benefitted from a freeze on fuel duty. But prices at the pump are lower, now oil is trading below $50 per barrel, so Osborne might decide that the nation’s wallets and purses can handle a higher fuel levy. Today’s autumn statement from George Osborne was supposed to be the big political event of last quarter of the year. In the event, because of the Paris attacks, it does not quite feel like that, but nonetheless this is one of the landmark political moments of the year - and of the parliament too. This is what we’re getting. 1) An autumn statement - a mini budget in itself. 2) A spending review, covering government spending until 2019-20. Osborne wants to eliminate the deficit by the end of the decade and so his spending review is going to involve very, very deep cuts to departments that are not protected. It will change the shape of the state, and alter long-term what it does. 3) A solution to the tax credits crisis. The House of Lords rejected Osborne’s plan to save £4.4bn by cutting tax credits, and today Osborne will offer an alternative approach. In some respects this will amount to a U-turn. But will the new welfare-saving measures he proposes as an alternative prove just as unpopular? Gordon Brown faced a similar problem when his abolition of the 10p starting rate of tax backfired, and that episode damaged his reputation almost beyond repair. 4) A settlement for the police. The Home Office is an unprotected department, and the police have been braced for significant cuts. But, since Paris, this has become much more problematic and even Tory MPs have been lobbying Osborne to protect police forces. Today we will find out to what extend he has been listening. I’m Andrew Sparrow and I will be covering the statement with my colleague Graeme Wearden, bringing you all the best reaction and analysis.

Musk's SpaceX company made history last month when it launched its craft, Dragon, on a successful mission to carry cargo to the ISS, orbiting 200 miles above the earth. The success of the launch has doubled the value of the company's shares from $10 to $20, according to private company analyst PrivCo. It values SpaceX at $2.4bn and Musk's stake in the firm at $1.6bn. SpaceX executive Kirstin Brost Grantham has told PrivCo that the privately-held company has entered into $4bn worth of contracts for commercial and government launches through 2017. The company's next major milestone is a Nasa contract to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station with a target date of 2015. President Barack Obama called Musk to congratulate him on SpaceX's success, and the company is now in line for a $1.6bn contract with Nasa for 12 flights using Falcon 9 and Dragon to resupply the International Space Station through 2015. Each flight costs $133m. Grantham said the latest mission was \"an important step in the right direction\" but \"there is a lot more work to be done.\" She told PrivCo that Musk \"is asking us not to be held by what has been done before but instead by what is possible.\" Musk, one of the founders of PayPal, has increasingly focused his energy on technology issues outside the internet. He is also the major backer of Tesla, the electric car company, he is also the chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. The company had major setbacks in its early days. The first three launches of its Falcon 1 rocket failed, and Musk has said one more failure would have killed the venture. Musk has said his ultimate aim is to ferry people to Mars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/video/2012/mar/20/china-wind-farms-renewable-energy-video","type":"video","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-20T09:01:00Z","webTitle":"China builds windfarms in renewable energy boom - video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/mar/20/china-wind-farms-renewable-energy-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/video/2012/mar/20/china-wind-farms-renewable-energy-video","fields":{"headline":"China builds windfarms in renewable energy boom - video","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/blog/2012/dec/05/sexier-electric-vehicles-range-anxiety","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-05T15:24:17Z","webTitle":"Sexier electric vehicles – without the range anxiety | Corrinne Burns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/dec/05/sexier-electric-vehicles-range-anxiety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2012/dec/05/sexier-electric-vehicles-range-anxiety","fields":{"headline":"Sexier electric vehicles – without the range anxiety","bodyText":"Electric cars still have something of an image problem. Aside from questions about whether they are as green as their manufacturers claim, for many motorists there is a more basic problem - they're just not cool. The SRZero is one of several initiatives designed to improve electric vehicles' image. It's an all-electric, 400bhp \"supercar\" with a top speed of 200kph, a range of 400km, and can accelerate from 0 to 100kph in seven seconds. The SRZero is, in essence, a modified version of Radical Sportscars' SR8. It retains that vehicle's chassis and bodywork, but instead of a combustion engine it has two Evo Electrics motors – and some serious battery power. It also looks pretty eye-catching. Designed and built over nine months by a team of engineering students at Imperial College London who call themselves Racing Green Endurance, the stated aim was to prove that electric cars could be sexy, while competing with combustion engines on their own turf (or should that be \"tarmac\"?). During road-testing in South Kensington, the team say they liked nothing better than pulling away from Ferraris at traffic lights. Not ones to do things by halves, the team at Imperial decided to prove their point by taking the SRZero on the ultimate road trip - 26,000 kilometres down the Pan-American Highway, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. At the Institution of Engineering and Technology Christmas Lecture at the University of Surrey on Wednesday night, team leader Alexander Schey will talk about some of the engineering challenges involved in taking an electric vehicle on such an epic journey. Range was the major issue. At present, even the best electric cars must recharge their batteries on average every 150km. Given that the Pan-American Highway traverses 400km of the Atacama Desert, running out of juice was not an option. As a result, much of SRZero's weight was given over to a 550kg battery pack, with a capacity of 54kWh - more than twice the capacity of the Nissan Leaf or the Ford Focus Electric. \"We chose lithium-ion phosphate batteries because of their energy density and safety,\" says Clemens Lorf, another member of the Racing Green Endurance team. Safety, of course, being an important consideration when you're driving through the rain in an open-top car, sitting on 550V. A great deal of time was spent ensuring the pack was well sealed. In 2010 the car safely completed the trek in 140 days, despite being stopped 70 times by police demanding to know whether it had insurance (it had). Lorf believes that the project has improved the image of electric cars: \"Adventures like this excite people, and give them a real feel for electric vehicles. It's not about talk, it's about action and showing what technology is actually capable of doing.\" SRZero isn't the only electric car to challenge the internal combustion engine, though. This year's Pikes Peak International Hill Race in Colorado saw an all-electric car, Toyota's P002, take fourth place overall, beating off several internal combustion engines. Like SRZero, P002 is based on a Radical chassis with two Evo Electric motors, but rather than lithium ion phosphate batteries it uses lithium ceramic ones, which can survive temperatures of up to 700C. And back in September the Nemesis broke the electric car land speed record, with an average speed of 244kph. The next big showcase for electric vehicles will be the Formula E series championship announced earlier this year, which is due to kick off in 2014. Battery technology is still a bottleneck for development, though. \"One of the key things which Zytek is concerned about with Formula E was that it should try to counter, rather than compound, concerns about range anxiety,\" says Pete May, senior engineer in hybrid systems at Zytek Group Ltd. \"The worst possible thing would be if the Formula E races are forced to be very short due to lack of available battery energy.\" May hopes that Formula E sporting regulations will be \"written in such a way as encourage development of batteries and control systems which enable extended ranges within a particular mass: 300kg was the FE battery weight limit.\" He also suggests that Formula E should drive the development of quick charging by setting challenge time periods between racing sessions. So will the development of electric racing cars improve not only the image of electrical vehicles, but also the technological and environmental reality? There may be a long way to go - and it's not just about the cars themselves. A recent report claimed that when the manufacturing process and battery disposal is taken into account, electric vehicles are not as green as is commonly believed. In the UK, charging infrastructure is still poor. Racing Green Endurance was able to charge its vehicle in six hours at caravan parks in the US – and, further south, from a variety of renewable sources such as geothermal and solar energy, and even hydroelectric power from the Panama Canal. Which brings us to another issue. In the UK, much of our electricity still comes from coal-fired power stations, so aren't we just swapping one carbon source for another? \"Fossil fuels will run out one day, so we must look for alternatives,\" says Lorf. \"There needs to be an economic incentive to switch to sustainable energy generation. Otherwise, again, it's about talking, and no action.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/dec/06/lightweight-solar-house-riba-silver-medal","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-06T12:56:00Z","webTitle":"SunBloc: the lightweight solar-powered house that fits on a rooftop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/dec/06/lightweight-solar-house-riba-silver-medal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/dec/06/lightweight-solar-house-riba-silver-medal","fields":{"headline":"SunBloc: the lightweight solar-powered house that fits on a rooftop","bodyText":"It has celebrated everything from a crying coastal defence system to a seaweed-fuelled power plant, a dreamy perceptual observatory to an animated film about robots. But this year, the RIBA's Silver Medal award – the highest honour for an architecture graduate student – has done the most radical thing of all: it has been awarded to a house. And a real one at that. SunBloc is the work of 10 students from the architecture department of London Metropolitan University (recently reformed as the Cass School of Art) who spent the last year developing a prototype lightweight dwelling, designed to occupy inner-city rooftops and other leftover urban sites. As a response to the urgent housing crisis and the wealth of underused spaces, it's a timely topic to be tackling. But does the project hold up? The scheme came out of a technically driven premise, looking at how best to construct a cheap, light, flexible house for the lowest cost and least environmental impact. Working in the diploma school's Unit 4, HelioMet – taught by Jonas Lundberg, Nate Kolbe, Eva Diu and Toby Burgess – the students developed a construction system using polystyrene blocks that could be easily transported and cut by two people with a hot-wire cutter. \"The idea was to make it as easy as possible,\" says tutor Jonas Lundberg. \"The blocks can fit in a lift and be cut with a template, with both parts used to avoid wastage, and assembled with unskilled labour.\" Once stacked into place, these highly-insulating blocks are post-tensioned with steel cables and covered with an acrylic render to form a durable, waterproof shell. With its swooping geometries and prefab logic, there is something decidedly retro about the final product. \"There were some experiments with making foam houses in the 1970s,\" says Lundberg, acknowledging this ancestry. \"But, being highly insulated with a low thermal mass, the indoor climate was always very humid.\" The students have countered this by developing an interior coating that combines a natural clay render, which absorbs moisture in the air, with phase change wax granules that help to maintain the internal temperature. Fully constructed, the house weighs less then 100kg/sq m – and it costs only £12,000 to build a 100 sq m dwelling. Could this be the bold answer to Grant Shapps's lacklustre call for a self-build revolution? The project was started in response to an open call for the Solar Decathlon, a global competition established by the US Department of Energy that challenges universities to design, build and operate a fully sustainable house using just solar energy. The SunBloc house is currently being developed in collaboration with students from the Guangzhou Academy of Fina Arts in China, to be exhibited at next year's Decathlon, held in Datong, near Beijing. The plan is to bring all of the Cass departments together to work on the project, from architects and interior designers to textiles and ceramics students. It is one of the first times the Silver Medal has been awarded to a group project, particularly one that has resulted in a built structure. It is a welcome departure from the recent trend of introspective theoretical schemes that often win the gong, which are conjured in the safe realms of academic posturing and neglect to tackle real-world issues. \"We are trying to rethink the idea of the single student with their individual design portfolio, which is a very strange version of the world of practice,\" says Lundberg. As the project developed, students worked with structural and environmental engineers, with each taking responsibility for a different part of the building, from the technical design to interior and exterior treatments. \"We want to create the right circumstances for innovation and experimentation, which involves working in a multidisciplinary context with other consultants.\" The SunBloc house is part of an ongoing trend for live projects in architectural education, which have become more common as students shop around for experiences they perceive to be more valuable to them in practice – as tuition fees rise and job prospects continue to fall. The Architectural Association has been running a Design and Make studio for the past few years, which regularly sees experimental timber structures built in the school's Hooke Park campus in Dorset. The Royal College of Art's architecture department, under the new leadership of Alex de Rijke and Charles Walker, has also joined in – this year, the entire first year is working together to produce a structure for a site in Wembley. But with the rest of your life facing the prosaic realities of construction in practice, isn't architecture school the one time to dream? \"It is important that live projects are not just about training or emulating practice,\" says Lundberg. \"We are trying to set up circumstances for innovation in a way you could never afford to do in practice, because it is too expensive or takes too much time. The academy should remain different – a place to do all of those things you will never have time to do again.\" The Silver Medal was jointly awarded to the following students who worked on the SunBloc project: Gustavo Balague, Lucas Dowsett, Nkesi Nduka, Georgia Neesham, Anna Nenaseva, Stephen Osborn, Chris Perry, Alex Potter, David Rieser and Anca Trestian."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-karnataka-india","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-15T09:23:06Z","webTitle":"Rio+20: A voice from Karnataka, India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-karnataka-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-karnataka-india","fields":{"headline":"Rio+20: A voice from Karnataka, India","bodyText":"It's very easy for cynicism to creep in about Rio. We set development goal after goal and nothing seems to be working out. But the interesting thing is that the heads of states and civil society are generally concerned about these things, and that's an important part of having the conference in Rio. When we look at the main issues of Rio, they are issues that we want to squarely face. That's what is giving us hope. But with issues like energy and the environment, at government level they will talk about it, but at grassroots level, poverty is the real issue. Access to education and healthcare, these continue to be the issues. You have to tackle poverty as it adds to emissions, increases population and insecurity. Poverty makes people cut down the forests, so degradation occurs faster. Women in poor families use harmful fuels to cook, which is not good for the environment or their health. Two million women and children are killed a year because of respiratory illness, especially in poorer households. Using cattle dung in a different way to produce biogas for fuel reduces the amount of methane, and this means other harmful things, such as degrading forests, are averted. My country has a large number of cattle. We can have many more biogas plants, which can be used for green energy. My organisation offers affordable micro-loans to people for renewable energy initiatives, such as biogas plants. Our government spends millions subsidising fossil fuels. It must stop all subsidies for fossil fuels and increase subsidies for clean energy. The government makes it so difficult to get subsidies for solar energy in India. Loans by banks are subsidised, but not from microfinance [organisations]. And who do the banks lend to? Rich people. What I expect from Rio is more governments taking decisions, and having the willpower to make them count. I hope something concrete will come out of Rio. We're almost at the end of the road now. It's now or never. I don't think Rio is about targets, but about commitment to act. The millennium development goals created an awareness of issues.

It's a daunting job. Arnold, 51, joined the company in autumn 2011 as head of the office of environmental affairs because, he says, of the sheer scale of the opportunity; last year, the bank booked $99.9bn (£64bn) in revenue and $21.3bn (£14bn) in profits, providing credit and raising capital of more than $1.8tn, for everything from home mortgages to credit cards to corporate bonds and IPOs. The bank manages another $1.4tn in assets (as of September 2012) for clients. If Arnold can help steer even a slice of that towards more sustainable ventures – for example, towards wind and solar energy and away from coal – he will be doing his part to make Wall Street a friend of the earth. But can he? \"The position I'm in now has the greatest potential for impact of anything I've done,\" Arnold says. \"Yet there's no manual for this. There's not a clear roadmap.\" True enough. All the big US financial services firms – Citi, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo – have environmental or sustainability executives, but their power and purview is limited. When activist groups, led by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), first brought pressure on Wall Street in the early 2000s, the companies would respond by citing their commitment to purchasing recycled paper or installing energy-efficient lighting. \"They'd always start off with operations,\" recalls Amanda Starbuck, who directs RAN's energy and finance programs. \"Let's get as many LED branches as we can out there.\" That was nice, but RAN is now challenging the banks to stop financing the world's most destructive industries – a much taller order. These days, Starbuck talks to sustainability executives at all the banks and says they range from \"naively optimistic\" to \"incredibly defensive.\" Arnold counts himself among the optimists, though he's not naive, he says. He came to the bank after a decade working with the financial industry, first as a consultant with Sustainable Finance, a firm he co-founded in 2003, and then as the leader of the climate change and sustainability practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which acquired his consultancy. Before that, he'd worked at EPA (where he stood out because of his Harvard MBA), started his own NGO and served as chief operating officer of the World Resources Institute. As well as his private sector experience, his environmental bona fides are impeccable. Arnold, who co-leads an environmental team, has spent much of the past year getting to know JPMorgan and its senior executives, so he can't point to major accomplishments just yet. (Because much of his work unfolds behind the scenes, he yet may not be able to in the future either.) His biggest project, he tells me, has been creating a framework to assess risk around hydraulic fracturing of shale gas; about 100 clients of the bank use the technology known as fracking. \"We are number one or number two in any given year in the oil and gas industry worldwide,\" Arnold says. After consulting with industry experts and NGOs, JPMorgan Chase surveyed its clients, seeking to identify environmental and social risks around fracking, including water use, waste water treatment and fugitive air emissions. \"We need to get smart about what best practices look like, and what unacceptable practices look like,\" Arnold says. Some clients wondered why the bank was asking so many questions. \"There were a few uncomfortable moments, to be sure,\" he says. But most were supportive. \"We're acting not as a regulator or cop, but as a concerned business partner,\" Arnold explains. By working with industry and NGOs, including the Environmental Defence Fund in the US and The Nature Conservancy, Arnold hopes to develop a consensus around how to minimise the environmental and business risks of fracking. That will serve the bank's interests as well as those of its clients and the planet. On a more modest scale, Arnold's team wants to make sure that financing is available for green ventures that make business sense. Chase Bank, the firm's consumer bank, promotes home equity loans to enable borrowers to make energy-saving, money-saving improvements to their property. In New York, the bank recently launched an initiative to help building owners cover the upfront costs of converting old boilers to burn cleaner natural gas. Banks and credit card customers are regularly urged to go paperless. What's harder is curbing the bank's financing of fossil fuel companies that generate greenhouse gases. \"We have a very strong constituency centred around Houston [Texas] and Tulsa [Oklahoma],\" Arnold says. \"And, by the way, they produce the products that make modern society what it is.\" JPMorgan Chase also does lots of business with the power sector, but electric utilities decide for themselves whether to burn coal or natural gas or invest in cleaner forms of energy. \"As bankers, we have zero influence on that,\" Arnold says. Oil, gas and power generation are, of course, huge businesses, accounting for about $6tn of the market value of the FTSE All World Index (as of January 2013). By contrast, alternative energy companies are valued at just $10bn. The result is that investment bankers, who are compensated for their deal flow and dollar volume, have little financial incentive to take environmental issues into account. The same holds true for asset managers, who have a fiduciary obligation to maximise returns for institutions and individuals who entrust their money to the bank. One sign of how hard it is for JPMorgan to turn away business is the fact that the bank last year provided financing for Alpha Natural Resources, which engages in the controversial practice of mountain removal mining of coal. JPMorgan had said that it would reduce its financing for moutaintop removal mining and, in fact, it has. But rival banks, notably Wells Fargo, have gone further, saying they will no longer finance mountaintop removal mining. Of course, coal companies will be able to borrow money from regional banks even if all the big banks exit from the mountaintop business. It may be that critics like RAN are asking for the impossible when they urge Wall Street to turn away from fossil fuels. What non-financial criteria should banks use when deciding whether to finance businesses and industries? Should they turn away from guns and tobacco, along with coal? Arnold muses: \"If it's a legally sanctioned product sold in a legal manner, on what basis do you say no?\" Then again, why have an environmental office if all it can do is nibble around the margins? Arnold believes that his team can identify opportunities for the bank to make money by financing sustainability programs, and by recognising, ahead of the crowd, the reputational and financial risks that can arise from doing business as usual. What's more, at a bank where business is measured in billions and trillions, working around the margins could have some impact. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

But the estimate comes on the back of a cut in the subsidies available for solar energy generation, to take effect from April, which will greatly reduce the amount of money households with solar panels will receive. Ministers said the cut was needed because the costs of solar panels have plummeted in recent months, and the new rules follow an unsuccessful attempt to impose cuts last year that was judged unlawful in the courts. Households fitting solar panels will receive 21p for every kilowatt/hour of energy they generate. This is down from 43p originally. Greg Barker, energy minister, pointed to new research that showed the cost of solar panels had dropped by 45% since 2009, far faster than had been predicted. He said: \"This is a scheme for the many, and not the few.\" The government also announced extra money for the feed-in tariffs, which could amount to £2.2bn by 2015. The money has been taken from unspent funds earmarked for the subsidies to other forms of renewable energy, particularly wind. Although renewable energy subsidies are not paid by the government – they come out of a levy on energy bills – the Treasury has set strict limits on how much can be spent on them. Howard Johns, a solar industry spokesman, said: \"The government's initial cut to the tariff was brutal, and this further cut will be utterly devastating for the UK solar sector. The hard facts are that a cut on this scale will leave the solar industry dead in a ditch, destroying tens of thousands of jobs and cutting off a green, hi-tech British industry just as it starts to flourish. In their rhetoric, ministers claim to want a renewable future, but they are destroying the very businesses that can make that future happen. This whole proposal has been rushed and chaotic, and while ministers try to force it through arbitrarily, hard-working people are losing their livelihoods. What was a real British success story is on the verge of being consigned to the dustbin.\" But Barker's message to the solar industry was \"get real\". Electricity consumers could not be expected to foot the bill for some households to enjoy large returns on their capital for investing in solar panels, he said. The initial tariff rates were set by Ed Miliband, then energy secretary, in 2010 based on the cost of solar installations at that time. But Barker said that the dramatic price falls since then meant that solar companies were making bumper profits and the small number of households that could afford the panels and had installed them were benefiting disproportionately, while the cost was passed on to all consumers through higher energy bills. The new mechanisms for cutting the tariffs regularly would prevent this happening in future, he said. \"Never again should we have fixed-rate tariffs that allow a bubble to grow,\" he said. By cutting tariffs in a predictable fashion in future, he said solar power developers could be more certain of making a sufficient profit margin, and households could expect a return on their investments in panels of about 5%. The government predicts that, despite the tariff cuts, because of price falls in the cost of components and installation, at least 625,000 households will install solar panels by 2015, compared with about 100,000 that have installed them under the more generous tariff. By 2020, the amount of solar power installed in the UK will amount to 22GW by government estimates – as much energy as is produced by more than 10 large modern power stations. Officials said this estimate was in the middle of their range of predictions, not the higher end. Under the government's new plans, now subject to consultation, in future the feed-in tariff rate will be cut twice a year as the cost of solar panels falls. Further cuts can also be brought in if the price falls faster than expected. The government said it would also be easier to install solar power on larger buildings such as schools or hospitals, and that a new \"multi-installation\" tariff set at 80% of the normal tariff would cover larger schemes with more than 25 installations. Officials said this was set because such large installations benefit from economies of scale. Households wishing to receive solar subsidies will also have to improve their homes under the new rules, so that they meet at least the D standard for energy efficiency. About half of homes already meet this standard, up from the around 10% that met the C standard that the government had previously proposed. David Symons, director at the consultancy WSP Environment &amp; Energy, said the new rules could be confusing for households. \"The introduction of regular reductions in support, coupled with potential additional ad hoc drops in subsidy levels, will provide more certainty for government, but less clarity to homeowners,\" he said. \"It's important to remember that the ultimate purpose of feed-in tariff support is to grow renewable generation in the UK. Some may read that the main priority of today's consultation paper is not to grow renewables but rather just 'maintaining a tight grip on spending'. It's important that homeowners have a clear view on the help they will get from the government if they invest in a solar panel. Today's consultation will make this harder to understand, so the government will need to work hard to provide up to date information on uptake if it adopts these proposals.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/the-northerner/2012/apr/03/solar-power-feed-in-tariff-old-trafford-roof-panels-st-john-s-church-community","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-03T11:00:00Z","webTitle":"Judicial review signals green light for community solar project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/apr/03/solar-power-feed-in-tariff-old-trafford-roof-panels-st-john-s-church-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/apr/03/solar-power-feed-in-tariff-old-trafford-roof-panels-st-john-s-church-community","fields":{"headline":"Judicial review signals green light for community solar project","bodyText":"An innovative community enterprise in Old Trafford has welcomed the Supreme Court's ruling last month over government plans to impose cuts on solar projects. The current Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) of 43p per kilowatt-hour, paid to people in Britain for generating electricity through solar panels, was originally due to be cut to 21p from 1 April 2012. However, last October the government announced the new tariff would come into effect for all solar panels installed after 12 December 2011, causing anger and confusion within the solar industry. In March the Supreme Court's ruling that the cuts were unlawful was welcomed by solar companies, many of which had already invested in solar energy with the original tariff dates in mind. And they were not the only ones celebrating. On Sunday a group of activists convened in St John's Centre, Old Trafford, for the official launch of St John's Sunshine (SJS). Comprised of Rev. John Hughes and three other founding members, SJS is an unusual collaborative project which aims to harness the sun's energy for the benefit of the community. The idea behind the scheme was the product of a chance meeting between Hughes and activist Fiona Nicholls in spring 2011. Hughes had long considered the possibility of installing solar panels on the roof of his church but was unsure how to proceed. Together with local campaigner Pete Abel and business consultant Gavin Wood, they concocted a plan to create the ultimate solar energy community scheme – run by the community for the benefit of the community. They would install solar panels on the roof of St John's church and use the money generated from the Feed-in-Tariff to fund local projects. The scheme would be run as an enterprise with all the profits going towards a 'Sunshine Grant' from which local schemes would be funded - from environmental ventures to youth projects. Crucially, members of the community would be invited to invest in the enterprise giving them a democratic say in choosing which proposals the grant would pay for. With the 43p/KWH tariff fixed for 25 years for projects beginning before April 2012, the team estimated they would receive a minimum annual income of £1350. Installation costs were estimated at £15,000 so in the long run it appeared to make perfect financial sense. But in October the government suddenly announced the FiT would soon be slashed by half from December, throwing their plan into uncertainty. Gavin Wood says: The announcement was disastrous for us. One of the main problems was that it would have meant a massive cut – about 55% of our income stream would just disappear. For any organisation to try and recover from such a huge cut is almost impossible. A long legal battle ensued after Friends of the Earth and two solar companies applied for a judicial review. Several appeals later, the Supreme Court's ruling in favour of the solar industry represented the green light SJS had been hoping for. Fiona Nicholls says: It was a huge relief. Despite the government's announcement we planned to go ahead with the project anyway but the ruling means we will have twice as much money to give back to the community in grants. Local Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, Kate Green praised SJS: It's a great scheme which brings together a very strong community project with a strong environmental project. I hope lots of people will get involved as investors and volunteers and will benefit from the way the community grants are decided and spent. SJS are now concentrating on attracting investors to buy shares in the enterprise and help pay for the installation costs. With no further legal obstacles anticipated, the future is looking sunny for St John's Sunshine and the Old Trafford community. Would you like to invest?

On Sumatra there is an extinct volcano. On that extinct volcano, there is a small lake, Lake Toba. In the middle of Lake Toba, there is a tiny island. This tiny island in a volcanic lake is, however, the same size as Singapore. David Bellamy, the famous British environmentalist, has said that tiny Singapore has more tree species than the continental 48 states of the US. Amitav Ghosh, a famous Indian novelist, echoed this observation: \"What is remarkable about Singapore is, despite all the buildings and developments, it remains so green.\" This is not a result of accident or good fortune. It is the result of a comprehensive matrix of environmental policies that reinforce each other, providing a model of environmental management that is worth studying in detail. The world also needs to study it urgently. In 2008, for the first time in human history, more people lived in cities than in rural areas. Urbanisation is accelerating. By 2050, it is estimated that nearly 70% of the world will be urban residents. Of the 25 most densely populated cities in the world, 17 are in Asia, and by 2025, 21 of the world's 37 megacities will be in Asia. Sadly, few of these cities are managing their environments well. The lessons from Singapore are clearly relevant to Asian megacities. Ghosh says: \"A lot of people I interviewed [in 1997] told me, 30 years ago, Singapore was just like Calcutta or Karachi. The transformation of this city in such a short time is a truly stunning thing.\" Just look at the water dimension. Projections from the 2030 Water Resources Group suggest that the global gap between water demand and supply could be as large as 40% by 2030. While the world is running out water, Singapore – which is one of the most densely populated countries in the world – is moving towards water self-sufficiency. Good public policies – including those that preserve water catchment areas, and develop advanced desalination plants as well as plants that utilise modern membrane technology – have led to this success story. This is why the Singapore Public Utilities Board (PUB) won the Stockholm Industry Water Award in 2007. Private sector dynamism meets public needs Significantly, many of these projects are provided through public-private partnerships between the PUB and private Singaporean companies, such as Keppel Engineering and SingSpring. The dynamism and innovation of the private sector has been harnessed to help meet public needs. Singapore's success in environmental management is also influencing its neighbors in Southeast Asia. Kuala Lumpur also began a greening program after watching Singapore's success. The late distinguished former Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, once told me privately that Jakarta's urban planners used to despair about improving their city. However, after studying how Singapore went from third world to first world in one lifetime, they began to believe that they too could succeed. And there are other remarkable Southeast Asian success stories. Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world, and has experienced the worst genocide of recent times. Yet its capital city, Phnom Penh, has a water authority that expanded the city's water output by 600% in just 10 years. It also manages its water supply better than most British water authorities. Given Singapore's environmental track record, it is appropriate that it plays host to two global, and increasingly influential, conferences that bring together major stakeholders from the public, private and non-profit sectors: the biennial Singapore International Water Week and World Cities Summit. These two conferences signify the international community's recognition that Singapore's successes in managing the scarcity of space and resources will help many other cities which will experience similar challenges in coming decades, if they are not already experiencing them now. Eco-city for the future Singapore is also sharing its experience directly with other cities. The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city, due for completion in 2020, is one such example. Together, the Singapore and Chinese governments are trying to build a sustainable city for the future, which will serve as a laboratory for the green technologies and public policies that we will need in the 21st century and beyond. Already, more than 600 companies have moved to the Tianjin Eco-city and 4,000 homes have been purchased. Singapore has also discovered that good environmental policies are good for business. As a result, Singapore is rapidly becoming a hub for the development and manufacturing of sustainable energy sources. Large international firms that specialise in renewable energy – such as Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems and Norway's Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) – have set up shop here. The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) is home to 160 leading researchers from across the globe, thanks in large part to a S$130m (£66.1m) government grant, and it collaborates directly with multinational solar companies such as Trina Solar and REC in research and development, as well as personnel training. These industries are becoming increasingly important to Singapore's economy: by 2015, the cleantech sector is expected to contribute S$3.4bn (£1.7bn) to Singapore's GDP and employ 18,000 people. In a world that is devoid of good news on the environmental front, Singapore's success provides a lot of hope to many. There is one critical statistic that explains the metaphysical significance of Singapore's success. If the world's seven billion people were to live in a single city as densely populated as Singapore, the entire world would only need an area the combined size of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana to live in.

Are you listening Bill Gates? Gates last month dismissed solar power as a \"cute\" niche technology. That was clearly rankling two leading industry executives, Thomas Dinwoodie and Daniel Shugar, who were touring Washington and New York this week to argue that the cost of solar power had come down enough to make it competitive with nuclear power, new natural gas plants, even new coal plants. \"It has already happened. Solar is competitive,\" Dinwoodie, the founder of SunPower, the second largest US solar company, told a discussion hosted by the New America Foundation. Solar costs have fallen sharply in the last few years, because of increased production and technological advances. \"Solar is ramping down in cost where it is competitive with all these other forms of energy,\" Dinwoodie said. He said the cost of solar power, currently 13.9 cents a kilowatt hour, would fall to 7 cents a kilowatt hour by 2020, according to the department of energy. That would put solar prices in the range, or even cheaper, than conventional energy sources, he said. That's encouraging news for an industry that has struggled to establish itself in the US, where solar power technology was developed half a century ago. Even after the Fukushima disaster, the industry is still fighting for space against nuclear power, which has strong support from the Obama Administration. It is also competing against a natural gas boom. Not that solar power has been entirely forgotten in the Obama Administration's clean energy push. Federal government subsidies cover up to 30% of the cost of new projects. California, meanwhile, is aiming to get a third of its electricity from renewable power. Those incentives have helped spread solar panels across the rooftops of the south-west and beyond, to north-eastern states like New Jersey. Big box retailers like Wal-Mart have also put solar panels on their rooftops. But there is growing opposition to the idea of solar super projects, especially in fragile desert landscapes. In one of the most contentious cases, BrightSource Energy has been forced to hire up to 100 biologists to protect a rare species of desert tortoise from its enormous project in the Mojave Desert. Solar power might be coming of age, but there are still plenty of growing pains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2012/sep/09/china-green-energy-industry-west","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-08T23:06:19Z","webTitle":"China's green industry expands in the west to offset slowing profits at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/09/china-green-energy-industry-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2012/sep/09/china-green-energy-industry-west","fields":{"headline":"China's green industry expands in the west to offset slowing profits at home","bodyText":"China's green energy industry has long been seen as a world-beater. But domestic pressures are mounting on its renewables firms as growth slows; and analysts are warning that Chinese companies could respond by accelerating their expansion overseas, stoking a rising east-west tension in the race towards a low-carbon economy. The European commission has just followed up US trade action against China by announcing its own investigation into allegations that Bejing firms are \"dumping\" cheap solar panels in European markets. But Chinese green companies are being hit at home by logjams on the power grid, the wider national economic downturn and increased competition of their own. Longyuan, China's biggest wind farm operator, has cut its projected new power installations from 2 gigawatts (GW) in 2011 to 1.6GW this year and says it now wants to expand in the US, South Africa and Hungary. It has just pushed rival Iberdrola of Spain off the global top slot, according to a new report from Make Consulting. Meanwhile, the grid problems and other issues have led Chinese wind-turbine maker Sinovel to report a 96% dive in first-half profits, while sales income was down by almost half. Sinovel is the second largest of its kind in the world behind Vestas of Denmark, while Goldwind (third biggest) recently reported an 83% plunge in first-half profits on the back of a 42% slump in sales. These setbacks may be temporary and are expected to increase Chinese activity overseas, rather than reduce it, according to Robert Clover, research director of Make Consulting. He says: \"China has seen 50% compound growth [in wind energy] since 2005 but is now taking a pause … There is no doubt that manufacturers of turbines and asset owners [wind-farm operators] are now looking at international markets for growth.\" And there are already signs that Chinese and other Asian firms are buying European rivals that have been hit by the credit crunch, the running-down of local subsidies and low-cost competition from abroad. One high-profile example of this has been revelations that Mitsubishi of Japan has been talking about buying a stake in Vestas, whose share price has been hit by a series of problems. The Danish wind-turbine maker, which has issued a series of profit warnings and has been through a major board and management team upheaval, has already sold off a wind turbine tower factory at Varde in Denmark to China's Titan Wind Energy. And this comes at the same time as the financially stricken German solar business Q-Cells, once a world leader, has been rescued from the liquidators by Hanwha Chemical of South Korea. Another major German solar business, Solon, which has also in been in financial trouble, was bought earlier this year by the Indian firm, Microsol. Meanwhile, China's Guangdong Aiko Solar Energy this summer bought collapsed Dutch business Scheuten Solar, while Ascent Solar – maker of solar-powered iPhone chargers – has fallen under the majority control of Chinese-Singaporean joint venture TFG Radiant. But while these takeovers are creating controversy, there is also considerable relief that hundreds of jobs are potentially being saved by Asian-backed rescue missions. The insolvency administrator handling the Q-Cells collapse, Henning Schorisch, said: \"I am very happy Q-Cells has found a strong partner in Hanwha, which has the means to provide company, brand and staff with long-term perspectives again.\" And state-owned Chinese energy company Three Gorges Corporation helped the Portuguese government by buying a major stake in the local utility, EDP, which is now a backer of plans to construct the world's largest wind complex – 1.5GW – off Caithness in northern Scotland. Britain itself has made no secret of its desire to allow state-owned Chinese companies to become involved in a range of new atomic power stations as well as buy North Sea oil fields. Clover says: \"Companies such as Three Gorges not only bring their own fresh capital but Chinese lines of credit at a time when lending from many western banks is constrained.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/may/24/kim-jong-il-son-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-24T11:30:29Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-il puts son and sun on agenda during China mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/24/kim-jong-il-son-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/may/24/kim-jong-il-son-china","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-il puts son and sun on agenda during China mission","bodyText":"The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, is exploring the potential of solar energy amid a debilitating dispute over his country's nuclear power programme. On a visit this week to China, North Korea's main ally and aid donor, Kim requested a tour of a solar photovoltaic manufacturing plant in Yangzhou between meetings with senior Communist officials and a trip to a shopping mall. Workers at JA Solar Holdings were told to stay at home while Kim looked around their factory. \"Apart from those involved in the visit, everyone was given the day off,\" an employee said. \"I can't tell you any more about it due to company regulations.\" The trip is shrouded in semi-secrecy. Kim's arrival in China at the weekend was reported around the world, but the two governments are unlikely to reveal details of the schedule until he returns to Pyongyang. This is his third visit in a year, prompting speculation that Kim is either lobbying for more food aid or trying to cement the succession of his son Kim Jong-un. His hosts, however, insist this is a study tour aimed at teaching the benefits of economic development. For much of the past two decades, North Korea has been a reluctant low-carbon economy due to a shortage of coal, oil and gas. China – the world's leading manufacturer of solar panels and solar water heaters – claims to set a more positive example and it is keen to persuade its neighbour to give up its ambitions for nuclear power. Kim's 40-vehicle cavalcade was seen at the photovoltaic plant in Yangzhou on Monday morning. South Korean media said this is a sign of his growing interest in solar power, but Chinese academics remain sceptical. \"North Korea is short of energy resources so Kim wants to learn from China and develop everything,\" said Liu Bo, an international relations expert at Peking University. \"But it will be difficult. Solar power requires high technology and great expense.\" Kim is also said to have visited a car plant, a lighting factory and a shopping mall, where he reportedly asked a clerk, \"Where can I find salad oil?'' Along with such titbits, regional media have focused on the weightier political and humanitarian implications of the trip. It is believed that Kim met the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin and the favourite to be the next leader Xi Jingping to try to secure their support for his chosen heir. Security and food concerns are also likely to be high on the agenda. Six-party talks aimed at easing nuclear tensions on the peninsula have been gridlocked for two years and North Korea has sunk a South Korean naval vessel and fired rockets across the disputed border. The humanitarian situation is also deteriorating, according to the World Food Programme, which has recently warned of food shortages. A US delegation was due to arrive in Pyongyang on Tuesday to assess the country's needs. The visit of Robert King – special envoy for North Korean human rights - and the deputy assistant administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Jon Brause – comes ahead of a meeting later this month of officials from the US, Japan and South Korea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/aug/16/belo-monte-dam-construction-suspended","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-16T04:39:00Z","webTitle":"Belo Monte dam construction halted by Brazilian court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/belo-monte-dam-construction-suspended","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/aug/16/belo-monte-dam-construction-suspended","fields":{"headline":"Belo Monte dam construction halted by Brazilian court","bodyText":"Opponents of the world's biggest new hydroelectric project - the Belo Monte dam in Brazil - notched up a rare victory this week, when a federal appeals court ordered construction to be suspended until indigenous groups are properly consulted about the project. The judgment on Tuesday may prove only a temporary reprieve but it is seen as a scathing verdict on the government's efforts to rush forward with the Xingu River project in the Amazon, which - despite controversy - is one of the pillars of Brazil's efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. It is also a setback for developers, led by Electrobras, which now face expensive delays or daily fines of up to R$500,000 (£166,00) if they do not comply with the court order. About 12,000 construction workers are due to work on the dam this year, which is eventually expected to produce 11,000 megawatts of electricity - the third biggest hydro-electric generating capacity in the world after China's Three Gorges and Brazil's Itaipu dams. But the project has faced strong legal challenges and protests by conservationists and local tribes. The project - initially conceived during the years of Brazil's dictatorship - was supposed to have gone through an extensive environmental impact assessment before the start of construction, but judges from Brazil's regional federal tribunal have accepted a lower court ruling that Congress acted illegally in authorising the dam without due consultation with the indigenous groups that might be affected. \"The court's decision highlights the urgent need for the Brazilian government and Congress to respect the federal constitution and international agreements on prior consultations with indigenous peoples regarding projects that put their livelihoods and territories at risk. Human rights and environmental protection cannot be subordinated to narrow business interests\" said the author of the ruling, federal judge Souza Prudente. Belo Monte will flood an area of 500 square kilometres along the Xingu and force the relocation of 16,000 people, according to the government. NGOs says the number of displaced may rise as high as 40,000. Opponents - including representatives of the Juruna, Arara and Xikrin tribes, as well as international conservation groups and celebrities such as Avatar director James Cameron and actress Sigourney Weaver - have welcomed the ruling. \"It's a historic decision for the country and for the native communities,\" Antonia Melo, coordinator of the Xingu Vivo indigenous movement, told reporters. \"It's a great victory which shows that Belo Monte is not a done deal. We are very happy and satisfied.\" But the battle is far from over. The Norte Energia consortium, which is building the dam, will have an opportunity to appeal, which they have done successfully in the past. Environmental and human rights groups are calling on the government to accept the judgement. \"This latest court ruling vindicates what indigenous people, human rights activists and the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office have been demanding all along. We hope that president Dilma's attorney general and the head judge of the federal court will not try to subvert this important decision, as they have done in similar situations in the past,\" said Brent Millikan of International Rivers. Slowing the momentum of a $16bn project is bound to run up against many powerful interests and the Brazilian government - which has made the expansion of hydro-power one of it priorities - is unlikely to back away from this flagship dam. But one of its main justifications - the production of non-fossil fuel energy to reduce the impact of global warming - may be undercut by other trends. In a new report, the National Institute for Space Research has revealed that carbon emissions from deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 57% between 2004 and 2011 as a result of improved measures to tackle illegal land clearances. If such gains could be built upon and more effort put into wind and solar energy, the pressure to harness Brazil's river might ease."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-07T10:21:35Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama swipes at Mitt Romney over climate change jibe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama swipes at Mitt Romney over climate change jibe","bodyText":"Barack Obama chose the biggest night of his re-election campaign to acknowledge the dangers of climate change – and to take a swipe at Mitt Romney for turning global warming into a laugh line in his convention speech. Obama thrilled Democrats when he accepted his party's presidential nomination on Thursday with a blunt rebuttal to the climate change contrarians who now dominate the Republican party. The president said he would continue to invest in wind and solar energy if he wins a second term, because the threat of climate change was real. \"And yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They're a threat to our children's future. And in this election, you can do something about it,\" Obama said, to a roar of approval from the hall. The remarks were a pointed and deliberate contrast to Romney. The Republican contender got the biggest laughs of his speech by making fun of candidate Obama's concern on climate change when he first ran in 2008. \"President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet,\" Romney said. \"My promise is to help you and your family.\" He got a standing ovation. The strong reaction in the hall – and the outrage from Democrats and others after a summer of heat waves, drought, wildfires and now hurricanes – all but ensured climate change a mention in Obama's own convention speech a week later. Obama said nothing about taking comprehensive action to limit the emissions that cause climate change. The Democrats' party platform, adopted this week, makes no mention of cap and trade, which Obama supported in 2008. The speech also touted the increase in domestic oil production under the Obama presidency, part of the president's \"all of the above\" energy policy. Even so, the remarks on climate change were Obama's most visible identification with the issue since December 2009 when he flew to Copenhagen and jumped in to all-night negotiation sessions to try to extract a deal at the UN climate change summit. Other Democratic leaders used Romney's remarks to draw a contrast with Republican positions on the environment. Earlier on Thursday night, John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 presidential candidate, said: \"An exceptional country does care about the rise of the oceans and the health of the planet.\" Bill Clinton in his speech on Wednesday night also made a passing reference to climate change. The rhetoric, evidently co-ordinated, suggests there will be a lot more talk about climate change from Obama and other Democrats during the election season than during the last four years. Over the past two years, Obama and other administration officials grew noticeably more reluctant to even utter the words climate change, as Republicans adopted attacks on climate science and environmental regulations as one of their core beliefs. Instead, Obama and administration officials shifted their focus to \"clean energy jobs\". On Thursday night, he used the term \"carbon pollution\". Obama made just a single mention of climate change in his state of the union address this year – but that was still better than 2011 when climate change did not rate a mention at all. One analysis found Obama devoted even less time to the issue in his annual address to Congress than George Bush. Romney's own views have also shifted since his time as Massachusetts governor when he saw climate change as a matter of urgent concern. And they do not appear to align with the derision in his convention speech, or fellow Republicans who do not accept the existence of climate change. Andrea Saul, his press secretary, said: \"Romney's view on climate change is he believes it's occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn't know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.\" Storify by Guardian partner Climate Desk on Romney and Obama's climate change comments ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2012/oct/29/teaching-climate-chage-recycling-natural-resources","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-29T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Teaching climate change, recycling and natural resources: ideas and activities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/oct/29/teaching-climate-chage-recycling-natural-resources","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2012/oct/29/teaching-climate-chage-recycling-natural-resources","fields":{"headline":"Teaching climate change, recycling and natural resources: ideas and activities","bodyText":"Coming back after the half-term break attentions will soon start to focus on the inevitable excesses of Christmas - parties, presents and food. So it's an ideal time to look at how, as individuals, schools and communities we can take small steps locally to try and solve global environmental problems such as growing and buying local foods and fashions, conserving and protecting precious resources and looking at ways we can generate power through cleaner, renewable sources. To help we have trawled through the resources on the Guardian Teacher Network and come up with our top pick of lessons and activities. There are ideas for discussion, debate and fun ways to get your pupils really thinking hard about waste (of all kinds), resources, food, climate change and recycling. Take a look and please do consider adding to our ever-growing collection of resources by uploading some of your own activities. Looking after our valuable resources: A comprehensive series of lesson plans, image banks and resources looking at global water issues, in particular tourism destinations where water scarcity is a growing problem. Ideal for KS3/4 pupils. An activity designed to discuss needs and wants with pupils - with an eye on sustainability and global resources. Can be adapted to suit a number of subjects and pupils. Thinking of making your own wind turbine to help with the school's fuel bills? Well maybe this plan will help. Suitable for secondary pupils. Windpower model making CAT. Making good food choices: This resource encourages pupils to think about where they buy their food and the impact it has on their environment. It offers an excellent background to sustainability and helps to inform sessions on the issues, challenges and possibilities related to the way we produce and consume food. This geography pack for 11 to 14 year olds covers the issues of over-fishing and the problems it causes and also takes a look at farmed fish and the need for sustainability in fish production. Forage for a free meal, make plant pots from rubbish and more inspirational eco ideas are available in this fun and engaging resource. Could easily be adapted for pupils of all ages but would mostly appeal to KS2/KS3 pupils. This is one of a series of similar projects - the others cover harvest, cooking, eating, soil and this fabulous one on waste. Looking at food rights this PowerPoint focuses on the UN conference on sustainable development Rio+20 and has case studies illustrating why people are going hungry around the world and looks at different approaches to solving the problem of hunger. It also addresses the issue of how climate change is affecting food supplies. This would be perfect for science and geography teachers at KS3. Talking about climate change: Worksheets are available here to allow younger pupils to think about diet and climate change. The resources help pupils to learn, think and take action as global citizens to help them understand the importance of food from a global perspective. Older pupils wanting to explore the complex arguments surrounding climate change could take a look at this resource - it explores the role that scepticism plays in the ongoing debate about the existence of climate change. An interesting one for debate. This report takes a detailed look at the impact of climate change on the Russian Arctic and also ways to find a solution to the problems. Best suited to students aged 14 to 18 years-old. Another resource focusing on the issue of melting ice, this time in Greenland, is this downloadable pack based on recent news stories which also includes activities and discussion points for use in class or as homework. Stimulating stuff for secondary pupils. Staying with the journalism focus on weather conditions this PowerPoint offers a look at the extreme weather of the past year including flash floods and torrential rain using photojournalism to stimulate the discussion. Some amazing pictures included in this resource. These cross-curricular lesson plans are broken down into six units that can be used with KS2 classes, clubs or with the whole school during an eco week. They can be used individually or all together to create a whole term' s topic and focus on climate change, energy, carbon footprints and solar energy around the world. Getting to grips with recycling: So is household recycling a waste of time? This topical guide looks at whether household recycling can reasonably be said to be a waste of time and offers lots of further reading too. Ingenious ways with plastic bottles is the focus of this resource for pupils of all ages. Lorna shows how the bottles are reused on her farm in Uganda - what could your pupils use them for? Take a look at how important it is to recycle household objects - a good intro to the subject for younger pupils who are coming to grips with different materials and what can be recycled and what can't. A perfect activity to send out for homework for KS2 pupils. An activity to help children learn what their carbon footprint is and how they can reduce it - tips on recycling and saving energy too.

But the Committee on Climate Change found that bills would only be £100 higher than today's average dual fuel bill of about £1,300, if the country concentrated on renewable power generation, such as wind power. The committee's findings rebuff the government's argument that gas will in future provide a cheap source of electricity and heating – and the findings are based on the government's own research. The report comes as ministers prepare to give the go-ahead on Thursday to a resumption of \"fracking\" – the controversial process of blasting apart dense rocks to release tiny bubbles of natural gas within. Fracking exploration was halted in Lancashire last year, and two small earthquakes were linked to the operations, but subsequent scientific advice has suggested the activity is safe. David Kennedy, the chief executive of the committee, told the Guardian: \"You hear a lot about the costs of moving to low-carbon power systems [such as wind and solar energy] but not much about the benefits. What we are showing is that a key benefit is the insurance you get against potentially very high gas prices and rising carbon prices.\" He said paying £100 more by 2020 for renewables was \"a sensible insurance\" against paying potentially £600 more for a reliance on gas. But he added: \"We don't think the policies are in place [to take up this insurance by encouraging renewables].\" Citing government research, the CCC found that the primary causes of energy bill increases since 2004 have been an increase in the international price of gas – accounting for nearly two-thirds of the increase in an average household energy bill – and the cost of ongoing investments in electricity and gas networks, which made up about 16% of the average bill. Meanwhile, policies to encourage low-carbon investment and energy efficiency improvements added only about 10% each to bills from 2004 to 2011. Gas is the new battlefield on energy and climate, and claims and counter-claims over the relative costs of relying on gas or opting for renewables have ignited a political conflagration. George Osborne, the chancellor, in his autumn statement, championed a new \"dash for gas\" that would result in as many as 40 new gas-fired power stations coming into operation in the next decade or so. But climate experts have said building so many new fossil fuel power stations would put the UK's carbon-cutting targets out of reach. A gas-fired power station built today will still be operating in 25 years' time. Prime Minister David Cameron backed his chancellor strongly during liaison committee questions on Tuesday evening. He said: \"It may be this gas revolution is really quite transformative: it may be there will be quite a lot of gas and the price will not be as [high]. This might be a revolution we should be involved in and, if we ignored it completely, we could be giving your economy much higher energy policies than are necessary.\" But his projections that the UK could massively increase investment in gas while meeting government-set carbon targets would require gas-fired power stations within a decade to be using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which despite nearly a decade of research and development has yet to be used on any major power station around the world. The development of CCS in the UK has been hampered by the government's refusal to put up the funds necessary to attract matching finance from the EU. Some experts and newspapers have suggested that shale gas could provide an abundant source of cheap gas for the UK. The CCC also found that energy bills were likely to be higher for commercial and industrial users, because their energy costs are more tightly linked to electricity than to gas for heating. Business energy bills are likely to rise by about 20-25% from 2011 to 2020 due to low-carbon policies. But the committee pointed out that, while for most households rising energy bills are a substantial part of household budgets and a major concern, energy costs represent only a very small share of the total costs to business, at less than 0.5% of costs in the commercial sector and about 3% of costs in the industrial sector. That means the impact of higher energy prices on businesses is relatively limited, and the knock-on effect on the price of goods and services to consumers will be even smaller – the CCC estimated it as about one penny to every £10 spent in the commercial sector, and six pence to every £10 spent on manufactured goods. Companies also have scope to minimise the impact through energy efficiency, which is still not widely practised. Greenpeace policy director, Doug Parr, said: \"This report confirms that George Osborne's dash for gas could cripple households with bills up to £600 more in coming decades than if we invest in low-carbon energy. The chancellor's gas gamble is risking people's wallets as well as the planet. Clean energy will not only insulate bill payers from volatile gas prices and ensure the UK meets its climate targets, but it will mean new green jobs and industries.\" Andrew Raingold, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, said: \"The implication of the committee's report is absolutely clear: investment in a portfolio of low carbon technologies provides a vital hedge against the prospect of high gas prices in the future. By contrast, the option for a large-scale shift towards unabated gas-generation in the government's recent gas strategy poses a massive risk to the UK's future growth. Businesses have repeatedly warned about the economic cost of locking the UK into high imported fossil fuel dependency: rising and volatile energy prices, serious concerns about security of supply, and a missed opportunity to build up UK supply chains.\" Prof Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said:\"The CCC's latest report puts a well-placed boot in the popular view that low-carbon electricity is bad for the pockets of householders and UK Plc. • This article was amended to correct a reference to £600 a year increase 'by the end of the decade' to 'in coming decades'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/grundfos-lifelink-sustainable-water-access","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-08T12:37:00Z","webTitle":"A new model for sustainable water supply in the developing world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/grundfos-lifelink-sustainable-water-access","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/grundfos-lifelink-sustainable-water-access","fields":{"headline":"A new model for sustainable water supply in the developing world","bodyText":"More than 1 billion people around the world have no access to clean drinking water. In spite of many years of humanitarian aid and development, it remains a major challenge to ensure access to water for all people. The sustainability rate on water projects in developing countries is alarmingly low, due to a lack of resources, capabilities and spare parts for service and maintenance. With the Grundfos LIFELINK solution the Danish pump manufacturer Grundfos is applying its core competencies in solving the challenge of providing sustainable access to water for rural and peri-urban communities in the developing world. The company has developed a solution for sustainable water projects that not only includes modern pump technology driven by solar energy, but also a sustainable model for ongoing financial management and technical service. Through an innovative payment system based on mobile banking the water revenue is automatically collected and finances the ongoing service and maintenance, which is carried out by a local team of professional service technicians. Thereby, Grundfos LIFELINK is providing a self-sustaining model for water projects in rural and peri-urban areas of the developing world. It might sound simple, but in reality it is a new paradigm in delivering sustainable water supply to the people who need it the most, and it shows the potential of business in providing innovative solutions for sustainable development. Through partnerships with the Kenyan government, the UN, Danida and other development organisations, 50,000 people in rural and peri-urban areas of Kenya now have reliable access to safe water from a LIFELINK system. This means a radical improvement in quality of life for the community members, and furthermore, it has brought about new livelihood opportunities in the communities where people start small businesses with water distribution, growing crops, or investing in livestock. Based on the experiences in Kenya since 2009, Grundfos LIFELINK is now expanding to other countries across Africa and looking towards Asia and Latin America in the coming years.

An Iraqi, born in Beirut, she trained as an architect in Britain and is committed to renovating dwellings built from mud bricks, a construction technique still used by half the world's population. In 2005, assisted by the artisans of Daw'an, she rebuilt walls, sealed roofs with quicklime, and trained Yemeni and foreign students. The aim is not to produce replicas, but to enable local people to stay in these semi-abandoned villages. Damluji provides modern working conditions, with a dining room, a bathroom and so on. Damluji is one of the five winners of the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture presented in Paris last month. The award, launched six years ago by Jana Revedin and the Cité de l'Architecture et du Patrimoine, advocates sustainable, ethical architecture, in the north and south. All the winners abide by this approach. Anne Feenstra gave up the comfort of the Netherlands eight years ago and moved to Kabul. He decided to give up \"star architecture\" and explore ways of making \"slow, sustainable architecture\". He concentrated on small projects, such as building maternity hospitals in various parts of the country, and establishing a reception centre for visitors to Band-e-Amir, Afghanistan's first national park. This location at the foot of the Hindu Kush, which shelters six crystal-clear lakes bordered by travertine rock formations, had had no infrastructure. Local people were in the habit of washing their cars in the lakes, and dumping engine oil and other forms of household waste. At almost 3,000 metres above sea level, with only limited resources – apart from earth, bricks and lots of imagination – Feenstra invented a style of sustainable architecture related to indigenous know-how, using solar energy to heat the quake-proof buildings. In Indonesia, on Sumatra, two young Norwegians, Andreas G Gjertsen and Yashar Hanstad, assisted by other architects, joined forces with the local community to build a cooperative cinnamon production unit, which doubles up as a training centre for the workforce. The award also distinguished the almost mystical work of Suriya Umpansiriratana, a Thai painter and convert to Buddhism, who is building a monastic centre at the heart of the jungle, in perfect harmony with its surroundings.

Now there is a third category – \"education widows\", a term that captures growing recognition that even those with an education are not always better off. \"Education widows have been failed by the education system,\" says Dolores Dickson, executive director of girls' education organisation Camfed in Ghana. \"These are young people who have been to school, but the quality of their education was so poor, they can't get a job. The family has invested in their education and they are expected to go out and earn an income. So they can't go home, they can't go to the farm, but they can't get a job either.\" Like many low- and lower-middle income countries, Ghana is coming to terms with the increasing complexity of its education problem. The Unesco report, Putting education to work, launched on Tuesday, found that more than half of women and more than one-third of men in Ghana aged 15 to 29 who had completed six years of school could not read a single sentence. Camfed – which has provided funding for more than 66,000 children to attend primary and secondary school in Ghana since 1998 – believes it has found a way to supplement the poor quality education on offer in state-run schools. In 2002 it created a Ghana \"Cama network\" of Camfed alumni, which brings together young women who have graduated with its support. Cama members are able to access skills training on financial literacy, business, leadership and life skills through the network's twice-monthly meetings. And since last year, those who complete training are eligible for \"innovation bursaries\" – a Camfed/Mastercard Foundation collaboration that offers small grants to female entrepreneurs to kickstart their businesses, together with work experience in relevant industries. Since the first nine bursaries were awarded in Ghana last September, six women have launched businesses, and all are turning a profit, says Camfed. In Fuo, a rural suburb of Tamale, the capital of Ghana's northern region and one of the poorest parts of the country, 31-year-old Balchesu Iddrisu has turned her husband's family compound into a small food processing hub. Outside are mounds of rice, which she has employed a local elderly woman to sift, removing stones. A room inside the building contains piles of wheat, soya and maize, which Iddrisu blends with milk creamer and groundnuts to make her own recipe for \"weenie mix\" – breakfast porridge. Iddrisu sells more than 1,200 units of weenie mix a month – at about £1 a bag – and she has begun approaching large supermarket chains and hospitals to buy in bulk. By buying her ingredients directly from local farmers, she says she has cut out middle men and is able to influence the quality of producers' crops. \"I am very happy with the way my business is going,\" Iddrisu says. \"It helps me and my family a lot. I didn't even know I could reach this level, with people working under me and creating jobs in my community. In 10 years' time I believe that I will have my own factory, and I will be training many people to become entrepreneurs.\" In Tamale, Cama member Sohua Alhassan, 31, says school alone did not give her the skills she needed to start a business selling a range of solar energy products. Alhassan, who grew up in a poor home with parents who were subsistence farmers, says she was inspired to set up her business by the lack of access to electricity in the region and the danger posed by traditional kerosene lamps, known as \"wanbongasi\". \"I went into solar because in northern regions most of the houses don't have access to electricity. In the villages, children can't study, or they use wanbongasi which are hazardous – they produce smoke and dim light which creates a lot of eye problems for young people.\" Alhassan is living off the profits she makes from selling the lamps – around £3 from a small desk lamp, and around £17 from a \"powerpack\" – a four-bulb home lighting system. But her personal story speaks volumes about the challenges of starting small businesses in northern Ghana. The youngest of six children, with both her parents now deceased, Alhassan is the only one of her siblings to attend school, thanks to a Camfed bursary. She is married, and has no children of her own, but one of her brothers, who has two wives and 10 children, is sick and now relies on her to help support his family. Alhassan has adopted one of his daughters, and is sending her to school. The pressure on Cama graduates to support their extended families makes it difficult for them to reinvest profits in their businesses. In spite of her obvious enthusiasm for her new business, Alhassan breaks down when speaking of her brother's illness and the burden of caring for his large family. \"It is very hard for me,\" she says. \"It's not an easy burden to be the only person that is educated in your family,\" says Dickson. \"They also feel that if they don't help their family members, they will be in the same situation they have just escaped. But the other side of the coin is that they grasp their opportunity to have an education themselves with both hands. The moment they get into school and see what they can become, we see them gaining confidence and becoming more articulate about what they want in life.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/nov/28/durban-climate-talks-plan-b","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-28T10:06:00Z","webTitle":"Durban climate talks: there is a feasible plan B to combat climate change | Simon Zadek","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/28/durban-climate-talks-plan-b","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/28/durban-climate-talks-plan-b","fields":{"headline":"Durban climate talks: there is a feasible plan B to combat climate change","bodyText":"History may vindicate the view that the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks were the most successful failure of modern times. Plan A was a top-down deal involving global institutions, massive cross-border public resource transfers and national commitments to which sovereign states could be held to account. The problem with plan A was not that the deal could not be closed, or even that the table stakes of $100bn a year could not be raised. The real problem is that plan A would absorb our attention and resources for years to come, while evoking the fury of the five institutional horses of apocalypse: political leakage, gaming, rent-seeking, bureaucratisation and corruption. Plan A, in a nutshell, simply would not work. By contrast, the alternative, plan B, is a messy, thoroughly human affair. National, regional and city initiatives developed with their citizens' narrow interests in mind, jobs, income and security. Such initiatives would be amplified and accelerated through international co-operation. Such co-operative arrangements might be evoked by richer folks' sense of public responsibility. But in the main, they would be driven by self-interest and fear, and perhaps some residual guilt. Plan B may be the only option, but it's still a high-risk gamble, as the UN's environmental chief, Achim Steiner, scathingly argues: \"The world has no option but to reach a binding agreement. If we don't have a global agreement, we become captive to the narrow self-interest of countries who only see the competitive advantage rationale in whether to act [on emissions] or not.\" And he has a point, with the UN's latest Emissions Gap report highlighting the gulf between emissions reduction commitments and what needs to be achieved, and McKinsey's blistering analysis in Resource Revolution of the massive resource productivity gap we face by 2030 as our planet struggles to satisfy the consuming demands of 3 billion middle-class folks. Two years on from Copenhagen, how is plan B playing out? Renewables is a case in point. China plans to develop a staggering 500GW of renewable energy generation by 2020, and with more than $1tn allocated in its 12th five-year plan to 2015 for renewables and smart grids. This mega-bet is catapulting China into becoming the world's leading provider of renewables infrastructure. But most developing countries cannot afford the additional costs of renewables, which is where the plurilateral bit comes into play. Morocco is advancing plans to build at least 5GW of renewables by 2020, with its plans to sell its desert energy to Europe attracting both private and public investors such as the European Investment Bank. India's flagship programme, the India Solar Mission, intends to attract $50bn in new investment. To kick-start the process, it is seeking support from international public institutions such as the International Finance Corporation. South Africa is advancing a game-changing increase in renewables, with plans for 17.8GW by 2030. The South African Renewables Initiative, to be launched in Durban on 7 December, is a South African government platform designed to attract other countries and public institutions as partners in financing the scaling up of renewables, including the UK government. The extra costs of delivering current plans for renewables are estimated to be up to $9bn. Were South Africa to raise its ambitions even further, to a technically feasible 24GW by 2025, the extra costs would rise to up to $14bn. Not surprisingly, South Africa has made the point loud and clear that it needs help in paying this bill. Such lighthouse initiatives show how in practice blending international public finance with private capital can reduce costs, and thereby raise ambition. For South Africa, low cost debt in sufficient volume, combined with insurance instruments that reduce commercial risks, could reduce the incremental costs of current plans by about one third. What remains is still a number to be reckoned with, but one that is much easier to digest domestically in return for the economic benefits that will flow along with additional tax receipts and foreign exchange earnings. Plan B has to work, and the evidence is that it has legs. But there is a long way to go in addressing Steiner's challenge of delivering the big numbers. The International Energy Agency estimates that $5.7tn must be invested in renewables alone by 2035 to avoid catastrophic climate change. Meeting this need requires a stepwise shift in mindset and practice. Current international public financing for renewables, principally debt not grant, is not of the right order of magnitude. Piecemeal international support and uncertain domestic plans create a vicious circle of low ambition and opportunity, weak leadership and distrustful investors who will as a result charge more for doing less. Turning the vicious into a virtuous circle that delivers ambitious renewables development, accelerated climate mitigation and upside economic benefits will require the international community to make larger-scale, longer-term, more credible commitments, and likewise domestically. Durban must move beyond demands for a drip-fed plan A. It must embrace an ambitious plan B rooted in communities' interests in having jobs, income and food on the table. With this in mind, new financing mechanisms must be close to the ground, and focus on mobilising lighthouse initiatives with mutual interest driving international co-operation such as in the cases of Morocco, India and South Africa. Banking on such initiatives could inspire the climate talks to advance actions that have a sporting chance of building on Copenhagen's successful failure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/dec/18/david-cameron-takes-pmqs-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-18T16:03:18Z","webTitle":"David Cameron at PMQs: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/dec/18/david-cameron-takes-pmqs-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/dec/18/david-cameron-takes-pmqs-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron at PMQs: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem MP, has been made a justice minister in a mini reshuffle. According to a blog by Channel 4 News's Gary Gibbon, Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, was \"taken aback\" by the appointment. • A cross-party committee of MPs and peers has said that the government's immigration bill could cause homelessness and discrimination. As the Press Association reports, the government has proposed a requirement for private landlords to check tenants' immigration status in the forthcoming bill. The joint committee on human rights has warned that creating a \"hostile environment\" for illegal immigrants could in turn lead to unjustified discrimination. Landlords, employers, bankers and DVLA staff are all expected to take part in checks for illegal immigrants under the bill. Hywel Francis MP, the committee chair said: Effective immigration control is recognised by human rights law as a legitimate aim which governments are entitled to pursue, and my committee accepts that the measures in this bill are intended to pursue that aim. However, creating a 'hostile environment' for illegal immigrants carries risks that the measures will have unintended consequences and lead to breaches of human rights and unjustified discrimination in practice. My committee is especially concerned about the restrictions on accessing residential tenancies according to immigration status, as these may expose children, and other migrants who have no right to be in the UK but face genuine obstacles to leaving, to the risk of homelessness, and could be applied in a way which is racially discriminatory. • The Local Government Association has said that the next two years will be \"the toughest yet for people who use and rely on the vital everyday local services that councils provide\". This is from Sir Merrick Cockell, chair of the LGA, commenting on today's local government settlement. Today’s settlement confirms that councils will continue to be at the sharp end of public sector spending cuts up to 2016, but that government has started to listen to local authorities and made some important concessions without which local services would have suffered ... The next two years will be the toughest yet for people who use and rely on the vital everyday local services that councils provide. By the end of this Parliament local government will have to have made £20 billion worth of savings. Councils have so far largely restricted the impact of the cuts on their residents. They have worked hard to save those services that people most value and have protected spending on social care for children and the elderly, but even these areas are now facing reductions. That impact will only increase over the next two years. The current public sector model, with its highly centralised control of budgets and spending priorities, is inefficient and will struggle to function in the context of long-term reductions to public spending. It needs to be replaced with a better and fairer way of funding local authorities which delivers adequate money, distributes it fairly and provides the long-term certainty councils need to plan for future demands. It is unacceptable that for a second consecutive year, councils have had to wait until the week before Christmas to find out how much money we will have to budget with next year. This prevents local authorities from being able to properly consult with residents and deprives local areas of the long-term certainty needed to run important local services to a high standard. No business would be run in this way. We look forward to the Chancellor delivering on his commitment to provide a longer-term funding settlement for local authorities. • Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has accused Labour of presenting \"a grossly inaccurate picture\" of a supposed NHS crisis. In a Commons debate, Hunt said shadow health secretary Andy Burnham should stop trying to whip up a crisis with claims the emergency services could not cope with the demand for ambulances. As the Press Association reports, Hunt said the chief of South Western Ambulance Service, Ken Wenman, was so appalled by Burnham's claims that his operators sent taxis instead of ambulances to call-outs that he had written to complain. A Freedom of Information request by Labour last month found 158 taxis attended 999 calls in the South Western Ambulance Service area in 2012/13, up from 35 occasions in 2009/10. But in his letter to the shadow health secretary, Wenman said Labour had never sought to clarify the taxis had only been used for non-urgent call-outs when a patient had suffered a minor injury such as a sprained ankle. Hunt told Burnham: When it comes to ambulance performance, frankly you should be ashamed because your whipping up of the problem so appalled the ambulance service that you received a letter from the chief executive of South Western Ambulance Service. Now this is what the chief executive of South Western Ambulance Service said about your comments in the House of Commons. He said 'It is both disappointing and concerning that the information provided to the shadow health secretary's office has been misinterpreted and misreported in order to present a grossly inaccurate picture for the purposes of apparent political gain'. I am astonished that someone would present such misleading information to the House of Commons. Burnham said the government needed to bring back the guarantee that patients could make an appointment with their GP within 48 hours of ringing up. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A Lib Dem source says that Tim Farron is not expected to stand for the deputy leadership, as he did last time. (See 3.26pm.) He is party president until January 2015 (which in some ways is a more important Lib Dem post, because the president is elected by all party members), and it is thought he will stick with that. So who will stand? Jeremy Browne, the former Home Office minister, Julian Huppert, the MP for Cambridge, and Lorely Burt, the Solihull MP, are three names being mentioned ... More on the Lib Dems' deputy leadership election. Simon Hughes has had to stand down because, when the coalition was formed in 2010, the Lib Dem parliamentary party agreed that the deputy leader should be someone outside government. The election will be in the new year. Technically the deputy leader is just deputy leader of the parliamentary party (not leader of the party at large), and so just MPs get to vote. At the last such election, held when Vince Cable stood down as deputy leader in 2010, Hughes beat Tim Farron by 38 votes to 18. Simon Hughes is going to stand down as Lib Dem deputy leader following his appointment as a justice minister, Lib Dem officials have confirmed. There will be an election to replace him. Here is some Twitter comment on the Hughes appointment. And here is Lord McNally on leaving office. It has been an enormous privilege to serve as minister of state at the Ministry of Justice over the last three and a half years. I believe we have demonstrated that the coalition can work effectively in taking the tough decisions imposed by economic circumstances while pursuing a radical reform agenda. I look forward to the opportunity to build on a decade of success tackling the causes of youth offending. It is a challenge I look forward to with real enthusiasm. And here is Simon Hughes on his appointment. It is a privilege and a huge responsibility to be appointed to this important job in Government. Issues of justice and civil liberties have been my passions since I was a teenager. Justice and civil liberties are also core issues for every Liberal Democrat in the country. Lord McNally will be a hard act to follow, but I will try and build on his significant achievements and wish him the very best in his important new role. I look forward to working in the Ministry of Justice and to contributing energetically to progressive and successful decisions and policies for the fairer and safer society which every Liberal Democrat wants to achieve. Here's Nick Clegg on the reshuffle. Tom McNally has been a fantastic minister who has pushed through a Liberal agenda in the Ministry of Justice. He will now bring the same wisdom, experience and effectiveness to his new role helping young offenders to turn their lives around. I am delighted to welcome Simon to the Liberal Democrat government team. He has been a passionate voice for the party's principles and values throughout the Liberal Democrats' journey from party of opposition to party of government. Simon will now be able to use his talents inside the coalition, helping the Liberal Democrats to anchor the Government in the centre ground and helping us to build a stronger economy and a fairer society, enabling everyone to get on in life. Two instant thoughts on Simon Hughes' appointment. • Nick Clegg seems to be firming up the Lib Dems' civil liberties credentials. Taking Hughes's appointment alongside Norman Baker's to the Home Office in the autumn reshuffle, Clegg has now got two prominent Lib Dems in ministries where they will be able to promote a liberal, civil rights agenda. (Or, if they cannot promote these measures, they will at least be able to pick fights with more authoritarian secretaries of state, Theresa May at the Home Office and Chris Grayling at Justice.) Presumably Clegg has decided that this is important for the party as the general election approaches and as the party tries to retain the votes of libertarians. • But it is also another example of Clegg \"give everyone a chance\" approach to ministerial office. He has spoken openly about wanting to ensure that a reasonable number of Lib Dems get the chance to serve in government. This explains why some competent Lib Dem ministers have been sacked. On the plus side, you could see this as an attempt to widen the pool of experience in the party. But a cynic might interpret this as Clegg doing his best to ensure that as many people as possible get the chance to collect a red box before the party gets consigned to electoral oblivion. There has been a mini reshuffle. • Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, has been made a minster of state at the Ministry of Justice. He replaces Lord McNally, who has been appointed chair of the Youth Justice Board. • Jenny Willott, a Lib Dem whip, will become a business minister, standing in for Jo Swinson while she is on maternity leave. Willott will remain a whip. • Lord Faulks QC, a Conservative, will become an unpaid minister of state at the Ministry of Justice • David Cameron has welcomed figures showing that unemployment has fallen to 7.4%, a four-and-a-half year low. At PMQs he said this showed the government's economic strategy was working. Today, for the first time in our history, there are 30 million people in our country in work. The fact is, at the end of this year we have a recovery they can't explain, growth they said would never come, jobs they said would never happen, and meanwhile they are stuck with an economic policy that doesn't add up and a shadow chancellor they can't defend. That's why the British people will never trust Labour with the economy again. But Ed Miliband said that people were not benefiting because of the cost of living crisis and that Cameron's policies favoured the rich. We all know what your long-term plan is - to cut taxes for your Christmas card list and make everyone else sink or swim. That's your long-term plan. I've got to say, the more you read out lists of statistics, the more out of touch you seem to the country. This was the year the cost-of-living crisis hit families hardest. This was the year you introduced the bedroom tax while cutting taxes for millionaires. This was the year you proved beyond doubt you are the prime minister for the few, not the many. • Labour has demanded the immediate publication of an internal Downing Street report into allegations against Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers. As the Press Association reports, Cameron confirmed at PMQs that he has seen the results of an inquiry conducted by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood into claims that Villiers held an undeclared meeting while a transport minister with a lobbyist working for a company seeking to build a railway depot in the green belt. The Conservative MP for St Albans, Anne Main, lodged a formal complaint earlier this year accusing Villiers of a potential breach of the ministerial code. Asked about this, Cameron said: \"I have seen a copy of the cabinet secretary's response and I am confident that it will be sent in the next few days.\" • Cameron has branded Ed Balls a \"turkey\". Speaking at PMQs, he taunted the shadow chancellor over a report in today's Sun, quoting a \"Labour insider\", saying Balls will be sacked if Labour's standing on the economy does not improve by next autumn. Cameron said: Ah! We have a new hand gesture from the shadow chancellor. I would have thought after today's briefing in the papers the hand gesture for the shadow chancellor should be 'bye bye'. You don't need it to be Christmas to know when you're sitting next to a turkey. • The European Commission has criticised Britain for accelerating regulations to cut stop EU migrants claiming benefits in their first three months in the UK. Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor, said it was \"too early to say\" whether the rules were complaint with EU law. Besides, the new regulations were unnecessary, he suggested. There is no evidence that EU nationals go to other EU countries in order to claim benefits or that there is any widespread or systematic abuse by EU nationals of other countries' welfare systems. On the contrary, numerous studies show that the vast majority of EU nationals go to other member states to work and that they usually pay more in tax and social security contributions than they receive in benefits because more of them tend to be of working age compared with the population of the host country. Earlier Iain Duncan Smith said that immigrants should remain the responsibility of their home country until they start paying taxes, and that the government will go \"much further\" in its efforts to keep out those without jobs. • Brandon Lewis, the local government minister, has announced that England's councils will face an average spending power cut of 2.9% in the year 2014-15. There are more details in his written statement (pdf). • Michael Gove, the education secretary, has announced that a further £2.35bn has been allocated to create more school places in England as schools struggle to keep up with pressure from a rising population. • Gove has told MP he will continue to resist pressure by the information commissioner to release details of unsuccessful applicants to join the Government's controversial free school programme. Giving evidence to the Commons education committee, he said that he wanted to protect those who had submitted applications in confidence from possible vilification and intimidation. I have nothing to hide but I do believe that it is important that we protect those people who put forward applications which may have been rejected because we know that free school promoters and others have endured vilification and attacks. I don't think that people who made applications on the basis that those applications would be treated in confidence and who may if they have been unsuccessful expose themselves to the risk of intimidation should be exposed to that risk by my actions. I will do everything possible to keep and protect the confidentiality of those people. I hope that we will prevail. If at the end of this process I have no option but to publish, then I will have no option but to publish. • The Electoral Commission has warned that more work needs to be done to make sure the government's IT systems are ready to transfer around 35 million voters to a new voting register next year. • Two peers have been suspended from the House of Lords after they were filmed by undercover reporters offering to set up influential all-party parliamentary groups for payment. As the Press Association reveals, the House agreed, without a vote, a recommendation from the Privileges and Conduct Committee to suspend Labour peer Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate for six months and Ulster Unionist Lord Laird for four months. The decision followed an investigation by the Sunday Times, which recorded the peers discussing the creation of an all-party group on solar energy with reporters posing as consultants acting for a South Korean solar energy firm. In a separate investigation by the BBC Panorama programme and the Sunday Telegraph, Lord Laird was covertly filmed discussing prospects for setting up an all-party group on Fiji. • The stalled official inquiry into the UK's involvement in rendition and torture in the years after 9/11 is to be handed to the controversial intelligence and security committee (ISC), the government will announce on Thursday. • The government has published a draft Wales bill, with measures to give the Welsh government powers to borrow money and to spend stamp duty revenues. • The Culture Department has announced that Dame Patricia Hodgson has been appointed the new Ofcom chair. • The Foreign Office has said Britain is withdrawing some embassy staff and dependants from South Sudan amid continuing violence in the newly formed East African state. PMQs Verdict: There's is a lazy assumption that economic recovery must be good electorally for the Tories. In fact there are some grounds for thinking that the opposite is true - read, for example, the three reasons cited in Patrick Diamond's Policy Network paper why \"recovery could actually strengthen Labour’s appeal\", or this Channel 4 News Factcheck blog - but it is hard to make those arguments in the light of today's exchanges, which saw a confident (or perhaps hubristic) David Cameron push back a competent \"cost of living\" attack from Ed Miliband. Christmas is the season for repeats, and the exchanges largely consisted of the two leaders swapping attack lines that they have used many times before. In rhetorical terms, about the only thing that was new was Cameron's (second rate) turkey joke about Ed Balls, which Miliband tried, with limited success, to turn on Cameron. At one point Miliband complained the Cameron was just reading out \"lists of statistics\". Miliband had his own statistics too, on gas bills and childcare costs. Generally this autumn Labour has been winning on cost of living issues, and the points that Miliband was making were all sound ones. He had a good line about Cameron cutting taxes for his \"Christmas card list\", and he posed questions, on rising living costs, that Cameron did not want to answer. All of this seemed to go down well with his own side, but at no point did he seem to seriously discomfort Cameron. Why? Partly, I think, it all sounded too familiar. And partly because although forcing Cameron to sidestep a question can make him look evasive (for example, if it were about whether he was still ruling out a Heathrow third runway), this tactic doesn't work so well when Miliband is just asking him to confirm an embarrassing statistic. (When judging PMQs, I try to imagine what a fair-minded observer might think. On this, I imagine, s/he would conclude that Cameron did not really need to answer, because it didn't count as a proper question anyway.) For Cameron, it was a fairly standard Flashman performance. His attack on Balls was not particularly witty, but Tory MPs liked it. The main thing, though, was that Cameron had some good news to trumpet (the unemployment figures). This seemed to lift his morale visibly and gave him the edge. Rory Stewart, a Conservative, asks Cameron to keep up a focus on the need for humanitarian assistance in Syria. Cameron says he is glad Stewart raised this. Britain is donating £500m, making it the second largest international donor, he says. And that's it. I will post a verdict shortly. Cameron says disposable income is higher this year than in any year between 1997 and 2010. The IFS said recently we had had the biggest recession for 100 years. Labour should apologise for that. Phillip Davies, a Conservative, says the only way Britain can keep EU migrants out is by leaving the EU. Cameron says he is not advocating that. But he does want to tighten the rules about EU migrants claiming benefits. Labour's Luciana Berger also asks about the allegations about Theresa Villiers. Will Cameron ensure the cabinet secretary responds before the Commons rises for Christmas? Cameron says he has seen a copy of the cabinet secretary's response. It will be send in the next few days. Cameron says MPs should look at what he said in Afghanistan about the mission being accomplished. Soldiers about to serve, serving or returning from Afghanistan are not being made redundant. Harriett Baldwin, a Conservative, says auto-enrolment shows the government is taking the right long-term decisions. Cameron says she is right to raise this. Anne Main, the Conservative MP, asks about the allegations about Theresa Villiers (a fellow Conservative) allegedly breaking the ministerial code. Cameron says he knows Main has written a letter about this. She will get a reply in due course. Labour's Iain Wright asks Cameron if he is concerned that real wages levels will be 5.8% lower at this end of this parliament. Cameron says real disposable income is rising. Labour's proposals have not helped. Guy Opperman, a Conservative, asks Cameron if he agrees on the need for better skills and apprenticeships. He does. Labour's John McDonnell says many of his constituents believed Cameron at the last election when he said there would be no third runway at Heathrow. Now they do not believe he keeps his word. Cameron says he does not accept that. There has been no third runway. People should read the Davies report, he says. Labour's Derek Twigg asks why cancer patients are suffering under the Atos assessment system. Cameron says he will look at this case. Atos started operating under Labour, he says. Henry Bellingham, the Conservative MP, asks Cameron to congratulate the emergency services who dealt with the floods in Norfolk. Cameron says they made an emergency contribution. And the local newspapers played an important role highlighting these problems. Labour's Gordon Marsden says DWP benefits sanctions are incompetent. One constituent has lost money for doing voluntary work in one local charity office, not another. Cameron says the government will stick to its plan. The benefits system should work for the people who need it. Ian Swales, a Lib Dem MP, says experts said Labour's energy price freeze announcement would raise prices in the short term. John Bercow says this has nothing to do with Cameron's responsibilities. Labour's Clive Betts says she visited a school where she was told about a girl coming to school on Monday who had not eaten over the weekend. Cameron says the child tax credit is up, protecting the incomes of the poorest. Therese Coffey, a Conservative, asks Cameron if he agrees that Labour's economic plan would be disastrous. You can probably guess the answer .... Labour's Nick Raynsford says the archbishop of Canterbury has reminded us of the need to care for the poor. Does Cameron regret his retreat from compassionate Conservatism? Cameron says he does not agree. The best way to get people out of poverty is to get them into work. And he does not agree with what the archbishop of Westminster said about immigration. Snap PMQs Verdict: Very little original in exchanges that sounded like a \"greatest hits\" Christmas special. Ed Miliband put it a creditable performance, but, buoyed by today's job figures, David Cameron probably had the upper hand. More later ... Mililband says that was a turkey of an answer. Childcare costs have gone up. There is one group Cameron has helped out, his Christmas card list. For someone earning £1m, how much less are they paying in tax? Cameron says the top rate of tax is higher than it was under Labour. And the highest earners are paying more in tax. The government froze council tax and fuel duty. The government has a long-term economic plan. Labour has no credibility. Miliband says Cameron's long-term plan is to cut taxes for his Christmas card list, and let everyone else sink or swim. The more Cameron reads out statistics, the more he sounds out of touch. This was the year Cameron proved he was the prime minister was for the few, not the many. Cameron says Miliband might not like the facts, but he can't ignore them. For the first time there are 30m in work. We have got a recovery Labour can't explain, and jobs they said would never happen. And, in Ed Balls, they have got a shadow chancellor they can't defend. Miliband says Cameron promised to get rid of the deficit in five years. He's failed. They don't want to talk about the cost of living crisis. That's because families are worse off? How much more is the average energy bill compared to last year. Cameron says Labour said 1m jobs would be lost. Miliband should apologise. Labour doubled council tax, put out council tax, put up fuel duty. He says Ed Balls is using a new hand gesture. Balls' gesture should be bye, bye. You don't need it to be Christmas to know you are sitting next to a turkey. Miliband says energy bills are £70 higher than a year ago. What about childcare? How much has that gone up each year? Cameron says the government is providing 15 hours of childcare. Labour never did that. The government can do that because it took tough decisions. Exports are up, the economy is getting stronger, and Labour is getting weaker. Ed Miliband says today's figure show a welcome fall in unemployment. For every person who gets a job, their family benefit. But does Cameron agree part-time work is a worry? Cameron says these figures paint an encouraging picture. Unemployment is down 99,000. The claimant count is down 36,000 this month alone. The government has now seen 1.2m people get job. The plan is working. Miliband says Cameron did not answer the question. It is good the economy is creating more job. But too many are part-time or insecure. Is it a worry that average wages are £364 lower than last year? Cameron says 70% of new jobs are full-time jobs. But there is more to do. It is all very well standing up at the despatch box, but Miliband said there would be 1m fewer jobs. We are waiting for him to correct the record. The only way to get more money in people's pockets is to keep on with the economic plan. What's his? John Whittingdale, a Conservative, invites Cameron to congratulate those campaigning in Ukraine for closer links with the EU. Should those responsible for harassing them be held responsible? Cameron says we should stand with the people of Ukraine. The world is watching, he says. Labour's David Anderson also offers his thanks to soldiers, and to public sector workers. He asks about the the victims of asbestos at work. Cameron says he respects Anderson's record on this issue. The government's bill offering compensation is a step forward, after a long delay. David Cameron starts sending Christmas wishes to soldiers in Afghanistan. We owe them a huge amount, he says. Here's Labour's Jonathan Ashworth on the heckling Tory MPs. (Labour MPs heckle too, of course.) Here's Sky's Joey Jones on Ed Miliband's options. Only about 15 minutes until PMQs. As I explained earlier (see 8.57am), today's session is likely to be a bit rowdier than usual. And I was making that prediction before the unemployment figures came out. As you can see (see 10.13am), they seem to have done wonders for Tory morale. If the shouting starts to get extreme, don't assume it's spontaneous. According to Isabel Hardman in the Telegraph last week, David Cameron has a special team of backbenchers primed to yell at Ed Miliband on his behalf. I’ve discovered that the Prime Minister now also has his own group waging ... verbal warfare on his behalf. David Cameron has hired the political version of the A-Team. This is a smaller group of what one of Mr Cameron’s coterie describes as “berserkers”: a Barmy Army known as the “Q-Team” of around 25 MPs keen to roar in support of their leader at Prime Minister’s Questions and whip their colleagues into a frenzy. The Q-Team is an old concept: older, in fact than the A-Team itself. Mr Osborne can remember photocopying documents for the original Q-Team at the start of his own political career. The Chancellor, Greg Hands, the deputy chief whip, and Gavin Williamson, Mr Cameron’s parliamentary private secretary, decided to resurrect the Q-Team in October having watched Mr Cameron struggle after Sir John Major’s none-too-helpful intervention on energy bills, with Tory backbenchers remaining po-faced and unsupportive. Afterwards, the three men resolved that this would be the last week the PM looked so lonely at the Dispatch Box. They assembled some of the best back-bench sledgers, including Alun Cairns, Robert Buckland, Therese Coffey, Mark Garnier, Stephen Mosley and Marcus Jones. This Q-Team meets at 10.30 on a Wednesday morning before PMQs to agree lines. This week the word to hurl across the Commons at Ed Miliband was “weak”. They are confident their heckling makes the Prime Minister appear more authoritative, both to those sitting in the Chamber and to the public catching clips of the exchanges on the evening news. You can tell the government is excited about the unemployment figures, because we've even had a comment from Nick Clegg. I can't remember him issuing a statement about unemployment figures before. I posted some reaction to the figures earlier. (See 10.41am.) Here's some more. From David Cameron From Nick Clegg These figures send out a clear message that we have built the foundations for healthy UK growth and a stronger economy. We’re seeing record levels of employment, with more women in the labour market and long-term unemployment at its lowest level in four-and-a-half years. This government has worked hard to repair and rebalance the economy, helping to create 1.6 million new private sector jobs since the election, strengthening Britain’s economy and building a fairer society. From Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary These are undoubtedly positive figures, but we should not forget how far we still have to go to restore pre-crash living standards through better pay and jobs. The real test for the Government is whether everyone will share in the recovery, not just a favoured few. Nor should we forget today that, as more people find work, nearly 400,000 people across Britain are set to spend their second successive Christmas on the dole and desperate for work. There are still hundreds of employment blackspots across Britain, with more than 15,000 long-term dole claimants in Birmingham alone. Ministers cannot ignore these areas just because the picture in other parts of the country is looking rosier. From Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary Unemployment falling will be welcome relief to many, but the underlying trends point to a growing part-time, low wage economy where the recovery is passing ordinary people by ... Unemployment may be falling, but Cameron and Osborne’s cost of living crisis is deepening and forcing working people to food banks this Christmas. The government needs to boost the minimum wage and invest to create a high skilled economy where people are paid a decent wage for a decent day’s work. From Matthew Whittaker, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank Today’s jobs statistics are resounding good news – it is encouraging to see the employment rate increasing, unemployment falling, and inactivity at its lowest level since 1991. Once again, however, the positive story on jobs is not matched by good news on pay. This week’s announcement of a fall in inflation will ease the pressure on pay packets to a degree, but wage growth itself still remains historically weak. Until that picks up, analysts are right to worry about the sustainability of the recovery—with pressure on household incomes from other sources, consumer spending rests heavily on a return to solid wage growth. From David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, These are very strong labour market figures, which back our recent forecast of increased growth in the fourth quarter of this year. From Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation The increase in manufacturing employment in the third quarter is consistent with the upbeat picture we've seen in several surveys and we are on track for a third consecutive year of increased jobs in manufacturing for the first time since 1997/98. From John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses Positive trends in unemployment figures reflect what FSB members tell us. Our quarterly business index finds that small firms are optimistic about staffing levels, with many expecting to increase headcounts over the next three months. From Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, It is interesting to note that total hours worked in the economy have grown slightly faster than total (headcount) employment. This reverses the pattern seen in recent quarters, and suggests that the trend towards shorter-hours working and under-employment may be turning at last, as the economy picks up. Despite this, however, it’s worth stressing that the number of people working part-time because they can’t find a full-time job still remains at an all-time high (just below 1.5 million). If this figure also begins to dip in the coming months it will be further confirmation that the recovery is a solid one. Also out today, the figures for public sector jobs show that the ongoing fall in public sector employment seems to have flattened out in the quarter to September 2013, although this may well be temporary given the further spending cuts in the pipeline, and meanwhile the strong growth in private sector jobs continues (up a quarter of a million between June and September 2013). The seemingly inexorable squeeze on ordinary workers’ living standards has also continued with yet another quarter in which average earnings growth at 0.9% is greatly outpaced by price increases at 2.2%. Michael Gove, the education secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons education committee. Here are some highlights from Twitter. Here are the regional unemployment figures. I've taken the chart from the Press Association. Region - unemployment between August and October - change on previous quarter - rate as percentage North East - 133,000 - minus 3,000 - 10.1% North West - 257,000 - minus 29,000 - 7.5% Yorkshire/Humber - 239,000 - minus 6,000 - 8.6% East Midlands - 162,000 - minus 6,000 - 6.9% West Midlands - 240,000 - minus 26,000 - 8.8% East of England - 176,000 - minus 35,000 - 5.6% London - 368,000 - plus 8,000 - 8.5% South East - 266,000 - minus 2,000 - 5.8% South West - 175,000 - plus 8,000 - 6.4% Wales - 112,000 - minus 7,000 - 7.4% Scotland - 196,000 - minus 7,000 - 7.1% Northern Ireland - 65,000 - plus 5,000 - 7.5% Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has dismissed David Cameron's announcement about accelerating regulations to stop EU migrants claiming benefits for their first three months in the UK. He said it was no more than \"smoke and mirrors spin to convince the public he is listening to their concerns\" because EU migrants are already entitled to have benefits transferred from their home country to tide them over during the first three months in the UK. Three months' curbs on welfare is just gesture politics. It's like sticking a plaster over an arterial bleed. With EU documents designed to provide parity among all EU citizens, wherever they choose to live and work, it will take more than a press statement and a chat in Brussels to change the principles of free movement of people. In an interview this morning Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, said that he wanted to go \"much further\" in curbing benefits for EU migrants. Here's the Guardian story about the unemployment figures. And here's how it starts. Britain's unemployment rate has slipped to a four-and-a-half year low of 7.4%, edging closer to the \"threshold\" at which the Bank of England has said it will consider raising interest rates. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that unemployment in the three months to October was 2.39 million, or 7.4% of the working age population, down from 7.6% in the three months to September. Under the Bank's policy of forward guidance, governor Mark Carney promised not to consider raising interest rates until unemployment has fallen below 7%. When the policy was announced, the Bank's monetary policy committee expected that to take three years; but their latest prediction is that it could be as soon as 2015. And here is some reaction. From Esther McVey, the Conservative employment minister It is really encouraging news that the number of people in jobs has increased by a quarter of a million in the last three months, bringing the total number of people in work to a record-breaking 30 million. Together with a big fall in unemployment, this shows that the government's long-term economic plan to get people off benefits and into work is proving successful. It's also thanks to British businesses up and down the country who are feeling increasingly confident about taking on workers. This is a great sign that the economy is growing. From Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury Thirty million people in work is another landmark on the long road to recovery. It's only been possible because we're sticking to a sound economic plan and because of the hard work of the British people and of British business. From Rachel Reeves, the shadow work and pensions secretary Today's fall in unemployment is welcome, but families are facing a cost-of-living crisis and on average working people are now £1,600 a year worse off under this out-of-touch government. Today's figures show prices have now risen much faster than wages for 41 of the 42 months since David Cameron became prime minister. Youth unemployment is still unacceptably high at over 900,000 and the number of people in part time jobs who want to work full time has risen again, to a record high of 1.5 million. From Paul Kenny, GMB general secretary These figures show that there are 2.4 million people seeking decent paid work upon which they can build a life. It is the responsibility of all political leaders to give a vision of hope for 2014. That means better quality jobs and full employment for 2014. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's papers, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories and here's the New Statesman's list of top 10 comment articles. And here are two articles I found particularly interesting. • Daniel Finkelstein in the Times (paywall) argues against further state funding of political parties. If a private donor was the only source of a party’s funds, the suspicion arises that he or she would exert excessive influence on the shape of that campaign. Exactly the same goes for the State. How long would the gap be between the state financing a party and a state quango deciding that certain communications should be disallowed? Disallowed because, say, the quango decides that public money shouldn’t finance negative campaigning or that a claim on a poster is tendentious or that a particular promise is unrealistic or vaguely formulated. Instead of causing dismay by this censorship, the quango might enjoy a wave of public support. Free political speech gradually becomes licensed speech. Once the Tory campaign chief Lynton Crosby is financed by the State, isn’t it reasonable for the State to regulate what he says, what he does and what he is paid ... We’re not far from completing the nationalisation of politics. Within the next few years, we could live in a country with state-financed political parties, state-regulated lobbyists and state-regulated pressure groups, a dominant state-owned broadcaster and a state-regulated press. I don’t want to get things out of proportion, but how comfortable are you with this? I know I am not. • Max Hastings in the Daily Mail says that David Cameron is wrong, and that Britain has failed in Afghanistan. To assent to the proposition that Britain and the other combatant Nato nations can congratulate themselves on a job completed is like Charles Saatchi announcing that his last marriage was a success. The U.S., Britain and other nations sent small contingents into Afghanistan in 2001 to achieve a limited purpose. They sought to secure the eviction of Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, by assisting local warlords to topple the Taliban host government. In this, they were swiftly successful. Unfortunately, however, the very ease of the achievement led Bush and Tony Blair to suppose that they could go much further. In 2006, they committed reinforcements in a crusade to change the very nature of the country — install a viable democracy, modernise the country and destroy the opium industry. In all this, of course, the West has failed. The expenditure of hundreds of billions of pounds, the loss of hundreds of American and British lives and tens of thousands of Afghan ones have merely transformed the country into one of the most corrupt on earth. Here is some Twitter comment on the unemployment figures. Tories figures are very upbeat. Some commentators agree. But there is a sting in the tail. Here are the headline unemployment figures. • Unemployment fell by 99,000 between August and October to 2.39m (7.4%). • The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance last month fell by 36,700 to 1.27m. Here is the Office for National Statistics news release. And here is the statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf). The Sun is saying that gaining the power to halt EU migration should be a red line in David Cameron's EU renegotiation. Its splash (see 8.57am) is an editorial, not a story, but story on the inside says that YouGov polling figures show that this is what the electorate wants. Here's a Press Association summary of the findings. A poll for The Sun found that 42% of those taking part viewed limiting immigration from EU countries as a priority of the \"utmost importance\" for the prime minister, while a further 20% said it should be a \"major aim\" and 10% regarded it as \"good but not essential\". Just 14% were opposed to changing the current situation. Some 43% said they would vote now for Britain to leave the EU, against 37% who would support staying in. But, in a significant vote of confidence in Cameron's policy of holding a referendum in 2017 after a renegotiation of UK membership, more than half (52%) said they would vote to stay in the EU if the PM secured \"major\" changes, against 23% who would still want to quit. The poll found that 29% saw it as \"vital\" that Britain should be able to decide what benefits it offers EU migrants, while 25% said it should be a \"major aim\" and 13% said it would be \"good\" - a total of 67% in favour. For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 41% (up 3 points from YouGov yesterday) Conservatives: 33% (down 3) Ukip: 13% (up 2) Lib Dems: 8% (no change) Labour lead: 8 points (up 6) Government approval: -28 (down 2) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 102. It's the last PMQs of the year, and that means there's a danger that MPs will be even more excitable than usual. Partly that's because, like most people faced with the prospect of a temporary release from the workplace, they tend to display \"end of term\" high spirits. And partly that's because the stakes are a bit higher than usual. David Cameron and Ed Miliband will both be particularly keen for \"a win\" so that their backbenchers don't spent all Christmas mulling over how poor their leader has been. Cameron has done his best to cheer his troops with an announcement overnight about accelerating regulations to stop new EU migrants claiming benefits. Here's the Guardian's story, and here's the Number 10 news release. But on the Today programme the former government economist Jonathan Portes has dismissed it as a \"phantom\" solution to a \"phantom\" problem. And it is not impressed the Sun, which today says Cameron must demand the power to halt immigration from the EU. I'll post more on this issue through the day. Here's the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Michael Gove, the education secretary, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. 9.45am: Unemployment figures are published. 10.30am: Administrators publish a report on the future of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. 12pm: David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs. 2.30pm: Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the joint committee on human rights. 3pm: Maria Miler, the cuture secretary, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee. 3.15pm: Vince Cable, the business secretary, gives evidence to the Commons committee on arms export controls. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon.

With the EU heading for a greater degree of fiscal and political union, many Tory MPs want David Cameron to promise some form of referendum on the terms of Britain's future membership of the EU. They argue that the community will be fundamentally different to the one the UK joined in 1973. Clegg's party is resisting a referendum, and the Lib Dems have also made clear they will oppose any moves by Cameron to repatriate powers from Brussels in forthcoming treaty negotiations – another key demand of the eurosceptic Tory right. The Lib Dems have toughened their stance at the very time that foreign secretary William Hague is preparing an audit of EU powers over the UK in preparation for possible talks on repatriating power. Coalition bust-up rating: 10/10 The green agenda The Lib Dems are desperate to hold the Tories to their pre-election claim to be green converts, but the omens are not good. At the Treasury, the chancellor, George Osborne, is busy apparently sabotaging the environmental policy agenda at every turn. This week ministers are expected to announce huge cuts to subsidies for wind farms, having already done the same for the solar energy sector. Eurosceptic Tories like Osborne argue that green policies and subsidies are a luxury that cannot be afforded at a time of recession. The Lib Dems reply that green industries will create huge numbers of jobs as well as helping to clean up the environment. Perhaps most divisive of all is the issue of airport expansion in the south-east of England: Osborne has put himself at the head of efforts to expand capacity, but the Lib Dems are opposed to this on environmental grounds. Coalition bust-up rating: 8/10 The constitution House of Lords reform, despite last week's row, is not dead in the water yet. Efforts will be made to offer Nick Clegg a watered-down package of changes to the upper house. But if the Lib Dems are not satisfied and feel that the Tories have reneged on part of the coalition agreement, they say they could vote down separate plans – backed particularly strongly by the Conservatives – to change constituency boundaries at the next election. The plans, which also involve cutting the number of MPs from 650 to 600, would benefit the Tories more than any other party. They are vital to Cameron, who hopes they will help him secure the Commons majority that eluded him in May 2010. If the Lib Dems do take their revenge by blocking boundary changes, with Labour's help, the coalition will effectively be at war, and it is difficult to see how it could survive. Coalition bust-up rating: 10/10 Welfare The Tories believe their plans to cut welfare benefits are very popular with voters: as a result they have been floating more and more radical proposals over recent weeks to slash them further for old and young alike. Cameron has suggested ending housing benefit payments to people under 25, while one of his close allies on the back benches, Nicholas Boles, has called for a debate on whether the country can afford to continue funding bus passes and winter fuel allowances for well-off pensioners. Many Lib Dems say the more radical ideas – particularly those that would slash benefits for the young – go too far. Coalition bust-up rating: 7/10 Education On some education issues, such as establishing a \"pupil premium\" for poorer schoolchildren, there has been agreement between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. But future clashes are looming as Tory education secretary Michael Gove looks to make his mark with radical reform, including to the examinations system. The Lib Dems have already put their foot down on this point and said they will not back Gove's idea of a return to the old two-tier division between O-levels and CSEs. Gove also wants to allow state schools to be run for profit – something he looks likely to press for increasingly, opening the way for major arguments with the Lib Dems.

The saturation coverage of the trip in state media had previously concentrated on its other first: Liu Yang, the youngest of the three astronauts, is the first Chinese woman to go into space. The trio entered the Tiangong 1 laboratory module around three hours after it linked up with their spacecraft, the Shenzhou 9, led by their commander, Jing Haipeng. The docking was shown live on television. The Tiangong 1 is a prototype, rather than a component, of the space station that China hopes to build in the next 10 years. But the rendezvous and docking practice is an important step towards constructing a full space laboratory. Although China is technically still far behind the United States and Russia, it is progressing fast, while the US has pulled back on its space programme. The astronauts will spend around 10 days working and sleeping on board Tiangong 1. Liu has a separate toilet and bedroom, Chinese space experts have said. The module includes an exercise bike and the astronauts will be able to recharge their laptops using solar energy, allowing them to listen to music and play games, state media has said. They will also be able to hold live video chats with their family. Liu's inclusion has created a new burst of interest in the space programme. \"Arranging for women astronauts to fly is not only a must for the development of human spaceflight, but also the expectation of the public,\" the space programme spokeswoman Wu Ping said before the launch. Chen Shanguang, director of the Astronaut Research and Training Centre of China, said: \"Space exploration activities would be incomplete without participation of female astronauts.\" But while many celebrated the news as a stereotype-busting step forward for Chinese women, not everyone seemed to have got the memo. The first sentence of one report by the state news agency Xinhua read simply: \"She is a wife.\" It went on to point out that she was also a good cook and \"proficient homemaker\". Pang Zhihao, a researcher with the China Academy of Space Technology, said Liu was even allowed to take cosmetics into space, although it is not clear if she availed herself of the opportunity. Although she is far less experienced than her colleagues – starting her training as an astronaut only two years ago – they have said she quickly caught up. \"Despite starting her training late, she is now on the same page as us, which exceeded our expectations,\" said the Jing in an interview before the launch. As a child, the 33-year-old wanted to become a bus conductor. But instead she joined the air force, where she became known for her patriotic speeches – winning a military speaking competition in 2010 – as well as calmness in crises. She also showed a steely resolve and independent streak, reportedly once writing to her parents: \"Under the protection of the family, baby eagles can never fly high.\" Chinese officials had previously said they would only send mothers into space, in case the experience might affect fertility, but state media reported that Liu does not have a child. Around 50 women have gone into space, but only eight nations have produced female astronauts and China is only the third to send a woman into space, having first put an astronaut into space in 2003. The first woman into space was the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova in 1963. Nasa did not put a woman into space until Sally Ride's mission in 1983 – more than 20 years after Alan Shepard became the first American man. •Additional research by Cecily Huang"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-22T23:06:13Z","webTitle":"Tory 'Tea Party tendency' putting green energy jobs at risk, warns Ed Davey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs","fields":{"headline":"Tory 'Tea Party tendency' putting green energy jobs at risk, warns Ed Davey","bodyText":"Tens of billions of pounds of investment in low-carbon, job-creating energy infrastructure projects that are \"ready to go\" could be lost to Britain because of an anti-green movement that is sweeping through the Tory party, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary warns today. In an interview with the Observer, Ed Davey describes a \"Tea Party tendency\" among Conservative MPs who question climate change and green investment as \"perverse\", and says it is creating deep uncertainty for an industry that could do much to help lift the country out of the economic doldrums. Davey is careful not to take aim at George Osborne, who is increasingly sceptical about the green agenda, but makes it clear that the \"noise\" created by some of the chancellor's \"friends\" on the anti-green Tory right risks putting off investors for good. \"Noises off at the margins are undermining investors' confidence and that is undermining green growth, and that is undermining the central purpose of the government, which is deficit reduction,\" Davey says. He says he has confidence in Osborne to continue backing the green agenda, even if some of those around him are urging him to take a different course: \"Of course some of these people are his [Osborne's] friends – some of these people on the margins – but he is going to be judged by growth. The Conservative party is going to be judged by growth. The Liberal Democrats are going to be judged by growth.\" Over recent months the Tory party, including David Cameron and Osborne, has appeared to dilute its enthusiasm for green policies that defined its supposed \"modernisation\" drive in the runup to the 2010 general election. Osborne is said to have formed the view that green policies such as investment in windfarms and solar power are too costly at a time of recession. He is understood to have been swayed by arguments put forward by the former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson, a climate change sceptic. Davey says, however, that there are huge opportunities for the British economy from investment in low-carbon energy infrastructure projects, including wind and solar energy, carbon capture storage and new nuclear power, all of which make up a large part of projected spending of £118bn in the sector over the next decade. Last year alone £12.7bn was invested in this country by the renewable energy industry, creating 20,000 jobs. Davey says he fears these opportunities will be lost if the pre-election consensus on climate change and green policies continues to be questioned. \"If there is not seen to be that consensus investors are going to balk. When you hear all that noise on the right of politics that worries investors. They think, 'Well if I am going to put all this money in – it is a 30-year investment – I need to know that if the government changes we are not going to have some rightwing Tea Party tendency taking over.' \" Last week the head of the Swedish firm Vattenfall, which opened its third British offshore windfarm on Wednesday, said the UK would fail to tempt wind turbine manufacturers to set up in the country because of the uncertainties about future government policy. \"If you look at the UK, not one supplier has established itself yet because of uncertainty in the future,\" said Oystein Loseth. Describing the arguments of the Tory right as perverse, Davey said he could not believe so many Conservatives failed to see the economic benefits of investment in green infrastructure, much of which would be from the private sector and so off the government's books. \"Energy infrastructure is going to drive growth and what is even more significant is that a lot of the energy projects are shovel-ready – they are ready go tomorrow.\" He went on: \"We have to win this argument for the future: it is almost like we have to re-win it. I am confident that if I was the chancellor I would want growth.\" As the Lib Dem conference opened in Brighton, Tory hostility to the green agenda was top of the agenda. Among those taking on Osborne will be his deputy Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, who has proposed a motion condemning \"the refusal of the Conservatives to acknowledge that investing in carbon-reducing technologies has the potential to make an important contribution to long-term growth\". Davey also made it clear that he was in favour of introducing a legal goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2030 – something also opposed by Osborne – although he said he believed this could be done through secondary legislation and with less stringent conditions than were being proposed by many of the green groups. He described the former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry, who was enthusiastic about renewable energy but sacked in the recent reshuffle, as a \"brilliant minister\" and said he had no idea why he had been dismissed from the post. \"I genuinely don't know [why he was sacked] because I have not had a conversation with the prime minister. I do know that Charles Hendry was a brilliant minister,\" said Davey. While Osborne is known to be enthusiastic about a new \"dash for gas\" – which he sees as crucial to the country's future energy needs – Davey was sceptical about over-reliance on gas. In particular he questioned whether exploration of shale gas in the UK would change the need for a balanced energy policy. \"As far as the British shale gas story is concerned I don't think it is a game changer at all, as we would still be dependent on imports.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/sustainable-water-access-grundfos-lifelink","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-07T16:29:00Z","webTitle":"A new model for sustainable water supply in the developing world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-water-access-grundfos-lifelink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-water-access-grundfos-lifelink","fields":{"headline":"A new model for sustainable water supply in the developing world","bodyText":"More than 1 billion people around the world have no access to clean drinking water. In spite of many years of humanitarian aid and development, it remains a major challenge to ensure access to water for all people. The sustainability rate on water projects in developing countries is alarmingly low, due to a lack of resources, capabilities and spare parts for service and maintenance. With the Grundfos LIFELINK solution, the Danish pump manufacturer Grundfos is applying its core competencies in solving the challenge of providing sustainable access to water for rural and peri-urban communities in the developing world. The company has developed a solution for sustainable water projects that not only includes modern pump technology driven by solar energy, but also a sustainable model for ongoing financial management and technical service. Through an innovative payment system based on mobile banking the water revenue is automatically collected and finances the ongoing service and maintenance, which is carried out by a local team of professional service technicians. Thereby, Grundfos LIFELINK is providing a self-sustaining model for water projects in rural and peri-urban areas of the developing world. It might sound simple, but in reality it is a new paradigm in delivering sustainable water supply to the people who need it the most, and it shows the potential of business in providing innovative solutions for sustainable development. Through partnerships with the government of Kenya, the UN, Danida and other development organisations, 50,000 people in rural and peri-urban areas of Kenya now have reliable access to safe water from a LIFELINK system. This means a radical improvement in quality of life for the community members, and furthermore, it has brought about new livelihood opportunities in the communities where people start small businesses with water distribution, growing crops, or investing in livestock. Based on the experiences in Kenya since 2009, Grundfos LIFELINK is now expanding to other countries across Africa and looking towards Asia and Latin America in the coming years.

Speaking to the Guardian, LH Manjunath, from Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP) in southern India, which provides consumer loans for energy projects, said: \"Most fossil fuels are subsidised. The [Indian] government is spending millions on subsidies. It must stop all subsidies for fossil fuels and increase the number for clean energy.\" His comments came as his organisation received a gold Ashden award at a ceremony in London on Wednesday evening. Five organisations received a total of £120,000 from Ashden, which each year acknowledges the work of \"green energy champions\" who are using local sustainable energy ideas to address climate change and tackle poverty. The prize money is used to help scale up the winners' work. SKDRDP, which has provided nearly 20,000 loans for renewable energy projects in Karnataka state, was this year's overall winner, winning a £40,000 prize. SKDRDP usually lends $300-400 (£190-250), which has a payback time of around three years. This can increase to 10 years depending on what the loan is used for. Typical weekly repayments are $3. Before taking out loans for energy projects – which could, for example, involve setting up a biogas plant that uses cattle dung to provide energy with reduced methane emissions – people have to show they have an income and are members of a \"self-help\" group. The organisation lends money to these groups, which then offer loans to members. Each member has to present a five-year plan of how they are going to spend the money. Interest rates are 18%. So far, the organisation has a 100% repayment record on energy loans. But although local solutions are important, Manjunath believes dramatic changes are needed on a national and global level to protect the environment and improve the lives of poor people. \"It needs the willpower of governments to make it count,\" he said. \"The government makes it so difficult to get subsidies for solar energy in India. Loans by banks are subsidised, not from microfinance [organisations]. And who do the banks lend to? Rich people,\" added Manjunath. Another Ashden award recipient, Tri Mumpuni, the executive director of the not-for-profit People-Centred Economic and Business Institute (IBEKA) in Indonesia, which works with communities to develop micro-hydro programmes that provide electricity, agreed that fossil fuel subsidies need to be cut. This year, Indonesia is spending $16.6bn on fossil fuel subsidies, she said. \"We definitely have to reduce subsidies on fossil fuels. The money spent for renewable energy and fossil fuels is unbalanced.\" Mumpuni added that she would like to see energy supplies decentralised to allow local resources to be better used. Mumpuni's organisation has helped install 61 hydro schemes in Indonesia, which has provided electricity for 54,000 people and saves 7,400 tonnes of CO2 a year. However, Richenda Van Leeuwen, executive director of the UN Foundation's energy and climate energy access initiative, who is spearheading the UN's sustainable energy for all initiative, and was also in London this week, said she was \"agnostic\" about subsidies, recognising that some countries still need them. She said the Cook Islands can only use diesel to deliver energy, so the government needed to continue offering subsidies until it can move towards renewable sources. \"We need to work with each country on specific issues. We need to ask: what are a community's issues and needs? Rather than thinking one size fits all, we need to look at the local context,\" she said, adding that both public and private sector investments need to be explored. All three agreed that June's Rio+20 conference on sustainable development will offer a chance to explore new ideas, but Mumpuni and Manjunath stressed the need for politicians to take firm action. \"If we are not all on the road towards sustainable development, we will face catastrophe,\" said Mumpuni."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/15/google-solar-mojave-ivanpah","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-15T12:44:33Z","webTitle":"Google invests $168m in world's largest solar power tower plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/15/google-solar-mojave-ivanpah","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/15/google-solar-mojave-ivanpah","fields":{"headline":"Google invests $168m in world's largest solar power tower plant","bodyText":"Google's product portfolio has now expanded from search engine power to solar power. The company has invested $168 million in a Mojave Desert facility that will become the world's largest solar power tower plant. The site is located on 3,600 acres of land in the Mojave Desert in southeastern California. According to gizmag, \"the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (ISEGS) will boast 173,000 heliostats that will concentrate the sun's rays onto a solar tower standing approximately 450 feet (137 m) tall.\" Construction on this plant started in October 2010. When finished in 2013, the facility is expected to generate 392 MW of solar energy. Solar power tower development, while less advanced than the more common trough systems, may offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capabilities. Parabolic trough systems consist of parabolic mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto a Dewar tube running the length of the mirror through which a heat transfer fluid runs that is then used to heat steam in a standard turbine. Solar power tower systems such as the ISEGS on the other hand focus a large area of sunlight into a single solar receiver on top of a tower to produce steam at high pressure and temperatures of up to 550 ° C (over 1,000° F) to drive a standard turbine and generator. The ISEGS also uses a dry-cooling technology that reduces water consumption by 90 percent and uses 95 percent less water than competing solar thermal technologies. Water is also recirculated during energy before being reused to clean the plant's mirrors. According to BrightSource Energy, the plant developer, this will be the first large-scale solar power tower plant built in the U.S. in nearly two decades and will single-handedly almost double the amount of commercial solar thermal electricity produced in the U.S. today and nearly equal the amount of total solar installed in the U.S. in 2009 alone. The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System • A 370-megawatt nominal (392 megawatt gross) solar complex using mirrors to focus the power of the sun on solar receivers atop power towers. • The electricity generated by all three plants is enough to serve more than 140,000 homes in California during the peak hours of the day. • The complex will reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by more than 400,000 tons per year. • Located in Ivanpah, approximately 50 miles northwest of Needles, California (about five miles from the California-Nevada border) on federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. • The complex is comprised of three separate plants to be built in phases between 2010 and 2013, and will use BrightSource Energy's LPT 550 technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/blog/2014/mar/12/european-stock-markets-open-lower-on-china-fears-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-12T17:14:36Z","webTitle":"George Soros: Europe 'may not survive' 25 years of stagnation - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/mar/12/european-stock-markets-open-lower-on-china-fears-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/blog/2014/mar/12/european-stock-markets-open-lower-on-china-fears-live","fields":{"headline":"George Soros: Europe 'may not survive' 25 years of stagnation - as it happened","bodyText":"The continuing worries about the Chinese economy, not to mention the tensions in Ukraine, have hit global markets again, and even a slight revival in the price of copper has not really helped to soothe the concerns.

Over in Italy, the lower house earlier approved a new electoral law, aimed at ensuring more stable governments and giving a boost to prime minister Matteo Renzi. Lizzy Davies in Rome writes: The lower house of the Italian parliament has approved the prime minister’s flagship electoral reform law as the country edges towards a new voting system aimed at avoiding the political gridlock that paralysed it last year. Renzi 39, who ousted his predecessor and party rival Enrico Letta last month, is pursuing an ambitious series of constitutional changes. If passed, these would also see Italy’s upper house of parliament transformed, and an entire layer of local government abolished. After a stormy passage through the chamber of deputies that exposed the deep divisions within his own centre-left Democratic party (PD), the electoral reform bill was approved by 365 votes to 165 after a deal between Renzi and the centre-right leader, Silvio Berlusconi. In a show of protest, MPs in Beppe Grillo’s opposition Five Star movement held up pictures of Renzi and Berlusconi united by a red heart alongside the words “condemned to love”. The deal also caused outrage among many in the PD. Renzi is also due to unveil a separate package of economic measures and tax cuts. The champagne, however, will be kept on ice. Despite having been given the green light in one chamber, the bill now has to go to the senate for another lengthy, and probably even stormier, debate. That in itself is a clear indication, says Renzi, of the need for radical institutional reform. Our full report is here: Italian PM Matteo Renzi’s electoral reform law clears first hurdle European Central Bank Executive Board member Yves Mersch has said it would be close to suicide not to agree on a mechanism to close down non-viable banks. Reuters reports: The resolution mechanism - still not finalised - is the second pillar of the banking union, which complements the unified banking supervision under the auspices of the ECB, together marking the most ambitious step towards closer European integration since the launch of the euro. Mersch said he was confident an agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) could be reached, though “whether the outcome will then be satisfactory from every point of view, that’s again a new discussion”. “I do not know of anyone who would have a plan B for a suicide. And not having an SRM would be very close to suicide,” Mersch said, when asked whether there was a plan B in case no agreement was reached before European elections in May. After two days spent trying to finalise the plan to tackle non-viable banks. European ministers said they disbanded on Tuesday with broad agreement, but officials said key questions remained open. Fitch has confirmed the European Union’s and the European Atomic Energy Community’s long term ratings at AAA with a stable outlook. Fitch said: The affirmation and stable outlook reflect Fitch’s assessment that contributions to the EU budget provided by member states rated AAA/stable, associated with multiple sources of protection to bondholders and limited debt service requirements in coming years, support EU’s ability to repay its debt. The EU incurs debt solely to provide emergency loans to sovereigns, whether they are neighbouring states (the macro-financial assistance (MFA) programme), EU non-eurozone sovereigns (balance of payment (BoP) programme), or EU MS (European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)). Total EU loans outstanding were €55.8bn at end-2013, mostly comprising EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal. The EU also guarantees European Investment Bank (AAA/Negative) loans to non-EU countries. Fitch expects debt outstanding to decline from 2015 as no new loans can be approved under EFSM. EU’s credit risk is significant as it lends to sovereigns experiencing financial difficulties. Ireland and Portugal now account for 78% of total loans. As with other supranational institutions, Fitch, however, expects the EU and Euratom to benefit from preferred creditor status compared with private creditors in a default scenario. Fitch deems that political support for the EU remains strong despite the long negotiations around the approval of the new multiannual financial framework in 2013; the EU has not experienced material delays in budget contributions by member states since the start of the global financial crisis. Fitch currently does not factor in its rating assessment the risk of the UK exiting the EU. The full statement is here: Fitch Affirms European Union &amp; Euratom at ‘AAA’ The session ends with a question about what constitutes an electoral pledge. Chote says there are two models. The first, as in the Netherlands, would allow the OBR to give a view on proposals submitted by the parties, but for any other commitments, the electorate would effectively have to make up its own mind. If the OBR had to look at all commitments, there was the danger that some off the cuff remarks made during the course of the campaign would be put to the OBR for them to cost. Chote says he would not want to be bombarded with letters saying “so and so said this” at some party meeting and isn’t this an electoral pledge that needs costing. He said: You have to have some sort of agreed dividing line. As Robert Chote continues, here’s an extract from his letter ahead of the committee meeting, addressing some of the issues with the OBR costing all party proposals: First and foremost, it would be essential to establish clear ‘rules ofthe game’ for all involved, well before the election, and to ensure that adequate resources were in place to do the job properly. To embark on this exercise in a rush, or with insufficient resources, could be very disruptive for the parties and very damaging to the OBR. Putting it bluntly, if Parliament wished us to play this role in the 2015 election, we would need a clear steer in the very near future to have any hope of putting the necessary practical arrangements in place in time to deliver a smooth process. Indeed advocates of the reform may now feel that it would be better to consider these issues at the beginning of the next parliament- with a view to being fully prepared before the subsequent election- rather than rush into it for 2015 and risk undermining support for the idea in the longer term. As you are aware, the OBR’s current remit only allows us to comment on the current policies of the current government - a restriction that had cross-party support when our legislation was passed in 2011. Changing the remit to allow us to look at other policies would require primary legislation. More fundamentally, any significant change in our remit - especially in a highly politically sensitive area such as this - would again require clear cross-party support if it was not to risk calling the legitimacy and independence of the OBR into question. The reform also implies potentially significant changes for the civil service and civil servants, particularly in relation to contact with opposition parties. The Treasury tells us that requiring civil servants to do work prior to an election being called that could not be shared with the Government of the day would represent a significant constitutional development and that this would be a matter for the Head of the Civil Service and the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, and ultimately the Prime Minister. I’m handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Thankyou for all your comments, and good-bye. Pressed on whether the costing of pre-election policy proposals shouldn’t be postponed until after the next election, in time for the subsequent election, Chote replied: Whenever you did it for the first time it would be difficult and challenging. My main concern is whether there can be sufficient agreement on the rules of the game and the nature of the job… My greater concern is can you actually get everyone to agree on what it is you want us to do. Chote said he has spoken to people across the political spectrum about this. He would “need the willingness of all the parties to get on with it” and time to get the resources together – i.e. extra staff. If parliament wants us to do this we will do it to the best of our ability. By the early summer we need to know the task we’ve been given. We would need over the summer to be putting in place the additional staff. You wouldn’t want to wrap that up in a matter of a few weeks. Robert Chote, who chairs the Office for Budget Responsibility, is being quizzed by the House of Commons’ Treasury Committee on the costing of pre-election policy proposals. You can watch it live on Parliament TV here. Back from a lunchtime meeting. A top London-based commercial lawyer has been appointed to lead the investigation into the role played by Bank of England officials in the possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates. Anthony Grabiner, a commercial lawyer who has been involved in high-profile cases, will lead the probe into whether staff turned a blind eye. He previously chaired a committee to oversee compliance, ethics and government procedures at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp’s British newspapers at the centre of the phone hacking scandal. BOE governor Mark Carner and others were grilled over the forex scandal by the Treasury Committee on Tuesday in a mammoth session – see yesterday’s live blog. In Ireland, bond yields have hit record lows – a day before the country returns to market with its first regular bond auction since exiting its bailout programme in December. Ireland hopes to raise €1bn in an auction of 10-year bonds on Thursday, three months after it became the first eurozone country to exit an EU/IMF bailout. Irish 10-year yields dropped 4 basis points to 3.01%, an all-time low. The bonds are in demand again after ratings agency Moody’s upgraded Ireland’s debt to investment grade from junk in January. Thursday’s auction is expected to give well. Time for a lunchtime round-up. Financier George Soros has warned that Europe “may not survive” 25 years of Japanese-style stagnation, and urged Scotland to join the euro if it becomes independent. Stock markets are sliding after reaching new highs in recent weeks. Main worries? Chinese growth and the Ukraine crisis. The FTSE 100 index in London is down 1.2%, nearly 80 points, at 6607.6. Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC have both lost 1.3%. Copper has tanked. Poundland and Pets at Home have made their stock market debuts. Poundland is doing much better – up nearly a pound from the 300p float price at 398p. Pets at Home traded below the issue price of 345p for most of the morning but has now risen above it, to 245.25p. More comments from Soros. He has blamed Germany for much of Europe’s woes because it has failed to take on a leadership role. Talking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, he said: My hope is that Germany is going to change and realise that the policy of austerity is counter-productive. Their memory is inflation, so they continue fighting inflation when the threat is deflation. The only people who can change it are the Germans, because they are in charge. They don’t want to be in charge, in fact they are determined not to be in charge. And that’s the tragedy. Turning to the EU as a whole, he said: There are many nations that go through long periods of stagnation, but they survive. Japan has just had 25 years of it and is desperately trying to get out of exactly the situation that Europe is moving into. But the European Union is not a nation. It is just an association of sovereign states, a very incomplete association, and it may not survive. This euro crisis has converted what was meant to be a voluntary association of equal sovereign states that sacrificed part of their sovereignty for a common benefit into a relationship between debtors and creditors. The debtors can’t pay their debts and are dependent on their creditors’ mercy, and that creates a two-class system. It’s not voluntary and it’s not equal. In his book, The Tragedy of the European Union, published in the UK on Tuesday, Soros writes that the banking sector is a “parasite” holding back the economic recovery and that little has been done to resolve the issues behind the 2008 financial crisis. He told the Today programme: Their first task is self-preservation, not servicing the economy, so small and medium enterprises, which are the lifeline of the economy, are not being served. Italy is the worst case - so these enterprises are going bust. The UK’s national minimum wage is to rise to £6.50 in October - up 3% - business secretary Vince Cable has announced. He said the government would accept the Low Pay Commission’s recommendation for an above-inflation increase of 19p. More here. Speaking at an event in London, Soros told ITV News that Scotland would have a “very difficult relationship” with the rest of the UK if it tried to keep the pound and it “would not be practical” for Scotland to remain with the Bank of England. However, the financier also warned it would be “inefficient and potentially dangerous” for Scotland to create its own currency, because currencies can be attacked and speculated against. And when you have a weak currency, positions can be taken. (Soros, of course, is famous for speculating against the pound in 1992, contributing to its exit from the EU exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the euro.) Instead, he said Scotland should “seek membership of the European Central Bank [ie the euro]”. George Soros has also opined on Scotland. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, the 83-year-old billionaire investor warned that Europe faces 25 years of Japanese-style stagnation unless politicians get their act together. He said Europe may not survive 25 years of stagnation. You have to go further with the integration. You have to solve the banking problem, because Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world in sorting out its banks. He reckons because European bank shares are “very depressed,” they are a good bet. Returning to China, Joe Weisenthal, executive editor of Business Insider, has spotted this Reuters investigation: How China’s Official Bank Card Is Being Used To Smuggle Billions Of Dollars Into Macau Some central banker comments this morning. The Bank of England’s chief economist Charlie Bean said in a newspaper interview that the Bank is in no rush to raise interest rates – which is good news for mortgage holders but bad news for savers. Inevitably there’s a lot of focus on what date the Bank Rate will go up. That depends on how the economy unfolds. But one thing we want to stress is, we don’t think there should be any urgency in raising it. When the time does come to raise rates, hikes are likely to be gradual and to a level that is “materially lower than before the crisis,” Bean told the Evening Gazette in Middlesborough. Meanwhile French economist Benoît Cœuré, who sits on the ECB’s executive board, said there’s no deflation in the eurozone at the moment but it it is a risk and the central bank stands ready to act if necessary. He said in a speech at a conference: We don’t see deflation in the eurozone. We see it as a risk. Britain’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has appointed Julia Hoggett to head supervision of investment banks. Hoggett is currently managing director for debt capital markets products at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and will start her new job in early May. A reader, Spike501, has helpfully pointed out that we haven’t reported the Scottish government accounts for 2012-13. They show that Scotland ran a bigger government deficit than the UK as whole - even when its share of North Sea oil and gas revenues is included. Scotland posted a net fiscal deficit of £12.1bn – equivalent to 8.3% of GDP in 2012-13, compared with 7.3% for the UK. In the previous year, Scotland’s deficit was 5% of GDP and the UK’s was 7.9%. Click here for more details. Spike501 says: I expect this will be the final nail in the independence coffin. Eurozone industrial production was down 0.2% month-month in January but this was due to a 2.5% drop in energy and the underlying trend points to growth. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, believes the currency bloc’s manufacturers are on a “modest recovery path”: On the face of it a 0.2% month-on-month dip in eurozone industrial production in January following a drop of 0.4% in December marks a disappointing start to 2014 for the manufacturing sector. However, the underlying data is more reassuring and essentially points to an expanding manufacturing sector. Overall eurozone industrial production in January was dragged down by a 2.5% drop in energy output. Furthermore, the drops in eurozone industrial production in January/December followed a 1.6% month-on-month spike in November with the result that output was up by 0.8% in the three months to January compared to the three months to October and was also up by 2.1%in January itself. With latest survey evidence from the purchasing managers reasonable, the overall impression is that the eurozone manufacturing sector is currently on a modest recovery path. Among individual countries, eurozone industrial production was constrained in January by Dutch output plunging 6.4% month-on-month while there was also a decline of 0.7% month-on-month in France. However, there were month-on-month increases in Germany (0.4%), Italy (1.0%) and Spain (0.2%). In a sign that the Greek recession may have bottomed out, the country’s industrial output rose for a second month in January. Production was up 1.1% year-on-year, led by chemicals, electronic equipment and computers, after a 0.5% increase in December. Drugmaker AstraZeneca has sold Alderley Park in Cheshire to Manchester Science Parks for an unspecified sum. All its 1,500 scientists on the site will move down to a new research and development centre in Cambridge by 2016. The company is also moving its global headquarters from Paddington in London to Cambridge, and will eventually have 2,000 people working there (including scientists). Manchester Science Parks, a public-private partnership, will keep the life science and biotechnology campus on the 400 acre Alderley Park site, including a cluster of 24 business start-ups. Some 700 people at Alderley Park who are working in communications, IT, legal &amp; finance for AstraZeneca will stay there beyond 2016 as sitting tenants. Up north, AstraZeneca also has a big factory in Macclesfield and a vaccine facility in Speke. Outspoken as ever, George Soros has claimed that the European Union “may not survive” the “long-lasting” economic stagnation it faces because of the euro. The billionaire investor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that eurozone countries are set to face “political crises” over the euro and Britain’s membership in the EU. A quick look at the markets reveals that the Footsie is down 0.84%, some 56 points, at 6629.37. Germany’s Dax has lost 1.1%, trading down some 106 points at 9201.32 while France’s CAC is off 1.3%, or 56 points, at 4293.6. Fears over Chinese growth and ongoing tensions in Ukraine are weighing on markets. Bad Chinese export numbers for February two days ago stoked fears of a slowdown. Neil Shearing, head of emerging market research at Capital Economics, told Reuters: There are concerns over the health of the Chinese economy, with signs that export growth is slowing sharply. And there are signs that the tensions over Crimea are continuing and showing no signs of abating. Christ Weston, chief market strategist at IG, has looked at what’s going on in Asia in detail - in particular the credit default fears in China. Asia is seeing greater volatility than other markets right now and many of the bears will be looking at this as a potentially defining moment for the Tiger economy and the commodity trade in general. Many of the key inputs for a trade which so many within China have profited from seem to be unravelling fairly quickly right before our eyes. Spot iron ore saw much calmer price action yesterday, but futures re-opened 1.7% lower today. Shanghai copper opened up limit down (-5%), taking LME 3-month and CME copper down too. However, buyers have come into markets as the afternoon rolls on... Clearly the other major issue is around the concern about heightened default in China and while many (including myself) saw last week’s corporate bond default by Chaori Solar Energy as a longer-term positive, the fact that we saw another Chinese solar firm having its bonds suspended from trading yesterday (due to its back-to-back annual losses) suggests this is actually having much larger ramifications on markets.This is true in the role of using commodities as collateral for sourcing financing from the shadow banking committee, and it has been speculated that anywhere between 60% and 80% of China’s copper imports of late have been used for financing. If correct, it effectively throws into dispute the role of Dr Copper as a barometer of the Chinese economy. The Pru has shrugged off any Asian volatility to report good results [see 8.42am]. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: Prudential has delivered a sparkling set of numbers which belie Asian economic concerns and are in sharp contrast to an otherwise lacklustre market. Overall operating profit, the cash generation surplus, new business profit and the capital cushion all showed significant improvement. It would appear that even the negatives, which are difficult to find, are offset – the present, relatively anaemic dividend yield of 1.8% has been boosted by a 15% increase to the full year payment. Elsewhere, the flat operating profit in the UK has been more than adequately covered by strong performances in Prudential’s other key geographies, namely Asia and the US. Further out, the prospects remain bright, with the group’s key demographics playing into Prudential’s hands – an emerging middle class in Asia, the US baby boomers requiring servicing, and an ageing population in the UK paying closer attention to its retirement needs. Today’s share price hike adds to the 33% jump over the last year, during which period the wider FTSE100 has risen 3%. Prudential’s ability to capitalise on its financial strength and geographical diversity is self evident and the market is equally buoyed by its prospects – the consensus has recently strengthened further and now comes in at a strong buy. Back to copper [see 8.11am]. China’s first domestic bond default last Friday has sent shockwaves through the copper market, fuelling fears that financing deals that have locked up huge quantities of copper could fall apart. This has prompted three days of heavy selling in copper. The Shanghai Futures Exchange’s most-traded copper contract fell to its lowest level in more than four years on Tuesday, while the London copper benchmark hit its lowest level in more than three years. Copper is used as collateral for borrowing and if company loans are not renewed, the fear is that investors could unload their metal supplies onto the market. Zinc and iron ore are also used for financing deals but copper is the preferred choice for China’s finance community. More on the Poundland and Pets at Home stock market debuts. Conditional trading has got under way, as reported earlier. Ishaq Siddiq, market strategist at ETX Capital, says: Poundland’s stock going better than the issue price of 300p which is the top end of the range. 12million shares have already traded; Poundland shares are currently at around 347p, an instant 14% premium to the issue price – the pop at the open for Poundland shares certainly reflects the popularity of IPOs in the London market. We listed Poundland in our grey market– it received high levels of demand from retail clients, more so than Pets at Home given the wider popularity of Poundland on the UK high street. Pets at Home, who we also listed in our grey-market, also received healthy demand but certainly not as rampant as investors’ appetite for Poundland. Pets at Home’s is trading below its issue price of 245p, currently trading around 232p but still in the indicative price range set out by the company. Taken together, both IPO debuts will be seen as a success, as retail investors were given the opportunity to be involved in the IPOs. Both these companies are consumer facing, so highly popular in the UK. Despite the controversy, last year’s IPOs of Royal Mail boosted investor confidence over IPOs with media hype and attention bringing stock floatations back into attention after the IPO dried up during the financial crisis. Rounding off our early morning round-up of corporate news, the Pru has delighted the market with a 17% rise in operating profits to £2.95bn for 2013, with double-digit growth in Asian markets. Sales climbed 5% to £4.4bn. The insurer lifted its full-year dividend to 33.57 a share. Its shares rose 3.3%, or 45p, to £14.06, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index. Turning to this morning’s corporate news, discount retailer Poundland and Pets at Home have made their debuts on the London stock market. Conditional dealing has just started. Poundland - which sells everything in its stores for a pound (but not its shares) - priced its shares at £3 apiece, the top of its initial price range. This will raise £375m and value the company at £750m. Private equity firm Warburg Pincus will own 37.9% of the company while Poundland’s directors and management will hold 10.2% between them. Pets at Home, which is mainly owned by US private equity group KKR, said it would float shares at 245p apiece, in the middle of its initial price range, giving the company a market value of £1.2bn. The market is seeing a flurry of retail flotations – AO World made its debut in February and Boohoo.com, B&amp;M and House of Fraser are also planning to list. In other retail news, online grocer Ocado is on track for its first annual pretax profit this year, after posting an 18% rise in first-quarter retail sales. Its shares have surged in the past year after it struck a deal with Morrisons to provide its online grocery operation. Ocado hopes to do similar deals overseas. And highstreet chain French Connection is still in the red, but underlying losses have shrunk to £4.4m for 2013 from £7.2m. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, eurozone and business. The FTSE 100 index in London and other major European stock markets have opened 0.6% lower - tracking losses in Asia and on Wall Street on Tuesday - after fears of another credit default in China and poor earnings prospects from some European companies. Italy’s biggest utility Enel warned this morning that its core earnings would fall from last year, while Germany’s biggest utility company E.ON cut its dividend and said it expected core 2014 profit to fall for the third year in a row. Chinese firm Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric reported a second year of losses on Tuesday, leading to the suspension of its stock and bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This fuelled fears that it could become the second Chinese company to default on its bonds after Chaori Solar last week. The solar panel maker failed to repay the bulk of an interest repayment that was due on Friday, as we reported. This, along with general concerns over China’s growth outlook, has hit copper prices, as copper imports are used in China as collateral to raise funds. London copper hit a 44-month low. Credit Agricole said: The outlook today is not a positive one. Copper prices continue to be hit by China growth worries... Ukraine tensions have intensified, with diplomatic efforts yielding no success and Russia stating that it would recognise the results of the referendum in Crimea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/11/green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-11T11:29:56Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Uranium mining, badger baiting and pandas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/11/green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/11/green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Uranium mining, badger baiting and pandas","bodyText":"Environment news • Oil sands pipeline battle turns ugly • Grand Canyon uranium mining to be banned for 20 years • China to release six giant pandas into wild • Fracking company chief to face critics in south-east England • 'Barbaric' gang jailed for badger baiting • Japan to release Australian activists who boarded whaling ship On the blogs • Biofuels become a victim of own success - but not for long • The Eco Audit with Leo Hickman: Are wind turbines increasing carbon emissions? • George Monbiot: Why libertarians must deny climate change, in one short take • Damian Carrington: Words matter but Zac Goldsmith is wrong to castigate green critics • Share your photos of 'signs of winter' Multimedia • Satellite eye on Earth: December 2011 • In pictures: Week in wildlife • Winter wetlands: your Green Shoots photographs • Panda cubs take first steps to independence in China - video Features • Free book: The Rough Guide to Community Energy • The waste mountain engulfing Mexico City • Greg Barker MP: Solar energy industry may be on threshold of an exciting era • A challenge to Christopher Booker: try Decc's future energy calculator properly Best of the web • EurActiv: Airlines could net £1.6bn windfall from EU carbon trading scheme, report says • ChinaDialogue: How children in China's urban jungle are reconnecting with nature • Yale Environment 360: Fukushima nuclear cleanup could create its own environmental disaster • BusinessGreen: Electric cars step up a gear for 2012 For more of the best environment comment and news from around the web, visit the Guardian Environment Network. ...And finally • Marks &amp; Spencer breaks mould with packaging for 'longer-living' fruit Supermarket vows age-defying fruit thanks to new packaging that will also help cut food waste"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/small-medium-cities-sustianability-milwaukee-columbus","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-28T12:22:13Z","webTitle":"Tale of two cities: sustainability trailblazers in America's heartland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/small-medium-cities-sustianability-milwaukee-columbus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/small-medium-cities-sustianability-milwaukee-columbus","fields":{"headline":"Tale of two cities: sustainability trailblazers in America's heartland","bodyText":"Discussions about sustainable cities and green business in the US often focus on New York, San Francisco and Seattle. It is easy to see why: Seattle and San Francisco have enjoyed their green reputations for decades and have entrepreneurs who combine hi-tech with green tech. New York's ambitious mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has focused on green initiatives that have inspired a wide range of green businesses and projects. But medium-sized and small cities in North America certainly hold their own and many host a thriving green business culture. One advantage such cities have over the titans on America's coasts is a lower cost of doing business, thanks to far more affordable housing and commercial space. Local governments that are not afraid to experiment and reach out to businesses such as green builders or clean energy startups are also a boost towards the development of a sustainable business culture. Ample low-cost factory space left behind by manufacturing companies that closed operations, or moved offshore, can also lead to new opportunities. Two cities in America's midwest offer examples of where businesses committed to sustainability are taking off. Milwaukee, Wisconsin is a leading example of a city that has transformed in recent years. Once a large manufacturing hub, Milwaukee has seen its manufacturing sector, and its beloved brewing industry, decline. But even during its industrial heyday, the city had developed sustainable practices. For 90 years the city's public works department churned organic fertiliser out of the city's sewage. Now entrepreneurs are turning abandoned factory space and brownfield sites into urban farms such as Growing Power. Beer companies committed to sustainability, such as Lakefront Brewery, have revitalised neighbourhoods, source more local and organic ingredients and provide economic growth as they expand their businesses. And green business is not limited to the city's gastronomical scene; Milwaukee also has a public-private scheme to boost solar energy installation in this city of 600,000. Green building and design are taking root in the city's old Pabst brewery. Even one of its most iconic companies, Harley-Davidson, is slowly increasing its green efforts, including the recycling initiatives that benefit other local businesses. Columbus may be in the middle of America's rust belt but the change underway in Ohio's capital ranks it at least a greenbelt on the sustainability index. The city has worked with businesses to build new green developments on old industrial sites. In a state that is still highly reliant on coal energy, entrepreneurs have opportunities to retrofit both government and privately-owned buildings to make them more energy efficient. The city has a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2% annually and, to that end, a pilot programme is in place between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and local manufacturers to reduce their factories' emissions. The E3 program has since expanded and is saving businesses millions of dollars a year in energy costs while creating new jobs. Columbus businesses can also share best practices about sustainability through the city's Green Spot programme. Any firm interested, with a membership of over 4000, must follow guidelines on waste and energy audits, monitoring monthly waste amounts and hold a commitment to purchasing supplies made out of recycled materials. The same companies are also required to encourage their employees to commute to work twice a month by means other than their private cars. Both Milwaukee and Columbus benefit from local universities that have a focus on sustainability, as well as attracting local entrepreneurs who want a big city lifestyle without the high price tag. Also, the green movement is not just relegated to cities that are state capitals or old industrial centres. Smaller cities are also involved: Wisconsin towns of Middleton and River Falls are bringing together local stakeholders to find a way to meld economic growth and environmental stewardship.

As children, they would play together while their parents hunted monkeys and tapir with blowpipes and spears. After they married, they regularly met to drink chicha and keep up with the latest gossip as western modernity crept ever closer to their indigenous Kichwa community. Today, however, the sisters are at loggerheads, divided by an offer from the country's biggest oil company, Petroamazonas, to start seismic surveys in their homeland of Sani Isla. Blanca declares she is willing to die to stop its advances. Innes passionately counters at community meetings that petrodollars are vital for the future prosperity of the community. \"It makes me very sad,\" says Blanca. \"We never fought before. We used to be so close. But now we barely talk.\" This is no simple sibling spat, but a difference of views on how to respond to an existential threat. The sisters, like their community and many others in the Amazon, are being driven apart by some of the world's most powerful macroeconomic forces. Their long-ignored corner of the Amazon – one of the most biodiverse places on Earth – is now at the centre of a battle between conservationists and miners, shifting Ecuadorean political priorities, and a planned trade route between Brazil, the world's biggest commodity supplier, and China, the greatest manufacturer. Sani Isla is only just coming to terms with the developmental tsunami heading its way, the first waves of which are already churning up the local political waters. In the last census, there were only 422 residents in this area of 43,000 hectares. Many have to paddle along the Napo river or hike through the forest to attend meetings but, in the past six months, this tiny community has been riven by accusations of bribery, interference by outsiders and even preparations for armed resistance against what they expect to be a vastly bigger and better armed invading force. The tumult has shaken a community that as recently as two generations ago numbered just half a dozen families, who had only recently made contact with the outside world – first with missionaries, then the state, then loggers, oil companies and tourists. Despite the increase in river traffic, particularly of boats carrying oil trucks and construction equipment, Sani remains home to some of the most ecologically precious habitats on Earth. Their land – an area of forest, swamps, creeks and lagoons just south of the equator – overlaps with the Yasuni national park. A single hectare in this part of the Amazon contains more plant and insect species than all of Europe. Outsiders now come in many forms. The main source of income and employment is the tourists who visit the Sani Ecolodge, which was built with money from the Occidental oil company during a previous failed attempt to prospect in the area. The community has received satellite dishes, computers and solar energy from the European Union. International NGOs, such as the Rainforest Partnership, have helped to build a women's centre and foster commerce in artisanal crafts. At least two of Sani's men have foreign wives. One of them is Mari Muench, a British businesswoman, who married the Sani Isla shaman and former president, Patricio Jipa. He says he saw her in a vision when he was 15. The couple run the community's ecolodge and are spearheading the fight to halt the oil firm. \"You can't have an ecolodge and oil. It's one or the other,\" says Jipa. \"We need to protect the forest, not just for ourselves but for future generations – for the world.\" He is opposed by his uncle, Pablo Licuy – another former president – who signed an agreement with Petroamazonas last year to allow seismic studies in return for $40 (£26.60) a hectare and a verbal promise to build a new school, communal kitchen, better toilets, a new football pitch and houses. Opponents say he signed without the approval of the community. Some speculate that this is because he has a nephew in Petroamazonas, others that he has been bribed (there are rumours that some community members have been offered motorboats if they accept). Pablo denies these accusations and insists he was working in the interests of the community because the oil company can provide more than the ecolodge. \"The lodge was supposed to help us, but it only benefits some people. For the rest of us, it means we can't hunt or fish,\" he said. \"Families are divided over this. I don't want to see that. But the opponents are making things very tense.\" In some ways, the community is a microcosm of the conservation debate taking place across the world. On one side are short-term economic pragmatists. On the other are eco-idealists concerned about long-term sustainability. Advocates of oil, such as Pablo Licuy, say that life is much better now that the community has computers and football. Many opponents, including Blanca and Licuy Vergas, say they would like to go back to a purer era when they were cut off from the outside world. It was not long ago. At 71 years old, Oscar Fernano Licuy Vergas is one of the few who can remember how rapidly the changes unfolded. \"When I was young, it was pure nature. Now, there's more pollution, more illness and people don't live in peace any more. Now we have fighting inside the community between those who want oil and those who don't,\" he says, during a break at a community meeting. \"We're under a great deal of pressure now because of all these big projects, but we feel a responsibility to look after nature.\" Contact has increased with the expansion of the nearest city, Coca, which was a cattle ranch 50 years ago but is now a busy municipality of more than 30,000 traders, plantation workers and oilmen that can be reached within three hours by motor canoe. The interaction has brought mixed benefits, according to Guadalupe Aviles, 55. \"When I was a little girl we had almost no contact with outsiders. If I saw them, I would run into the forest,\" she said. \"I learned a lot from the missionaries, but I wish we had never had contact with the oil companies. The big change now is that they offer individual families jobs or engines for their canoes. That is dividing people.\" Most of the supporters of oil feel they are not getting their fair share of the benefits from the lodge. Their opponents say tourism promises long-term benefits and a clean environment, whereas the oil will only last a few decades, provide a brief economic boost and then leave with the environment ruined. There are precedents. Ecuador is seeking $27bn in compensation from Texaco for the damage the US company's Chevron subsidiary did in the Amazon in the 1970s and 80s, yet the government continues to promote exploration by Petroamazonas, Repsol and other oil firms. The Quito-based environmental campaigners Acción Ecológica have taken community members on \"toxic tours\" to affected areas. After this, in a marathon session last month, the community voted by a large majority to reject the oil company and seek alternative sources of income through the ecolodge, of which Mari Muench is now in charge. But Petroamazonas, which owns exploration rights in Sani, continues to look for an opening. Representatives of the company and the agriculture ministry visited while the Guardian was in Sani. They said they were there to deliver invitations to workshops on sustainable fishing and farming and declined to comment about oil exploration. Although the government and oil company have yet to respond directly to the Guardian about Sani, they say drilling in the Amazon is necessary to raise money for poverty alleviation, improved state infrastructure and better public services. Today's technology, they argue, is much more environmentally friendly than in the days of Chevron. Ecuador has won international kudos in recent years for its seemingly progressive environmental policies, including the world's first constitution that recognises the rights of nature, and the ITT initiative. This promises not to exploit oil in a 180,000-hectare area of the Yasuni national park – just downstream of Sani – if the international community can raise half the estimated $7.6bn value of the fossil fuel. By comparison, the campaign for Sani Isla is a grassroots affair that has only just started to attract the attention of the domestic media. It lacks high-level political support and the finances needed to fight a legal battle. Locals are aware they are fighting an uphill battle. \"We don't have money. That's the problem. We're just a small lodge against a multibillion-dollar company,\" says the president, Leonardo Tapuy. \"It's difficult to be president of a divided community. To unite them, we need to be well organised and to explain our reasoning clearly.\" But Sani has picked up support from environmental and indigenous groups in Ecuador, as well as the global campaign group Avaaz, which collected more than a million online signatures in a petition to the Ecuadorean president, Rafael Correa, to halt oil drilling in Sani. But Correa too is influenced by outside forces and economic pressures. Since he renegotiated the country's debts in 2008, Ecuador has been unable to access finance on international markets. Instead it has sold more oil and borrowed more from China – both of which add to the impetus to exploit fossil fuels in the Amazon. Alberto Acosta – Correa's former right-hand man, author of the constitution and a rival in the recent presidential election – estimates the nation's debt to Beijing at $17bn. \"China lends money to the government. The government repays with oil,\" he said in explaining why the push to exploit resources in the Amazon had accelerated in recent years. That is not the only threat to this small community from global geopolitical shifts. The Napo river, which runs through Sani's territory and marks the border of the Yasuni national park, is being eyed as part of a new trade route from Ecuador's Manta port to Brazil's Manaus, 2,000km to the east. A mix of river and road transport has long been seen as an alternative to the Panama Canal. It would cut the journey times and costs of sending raw materials from Brazil to its biggest customers in Asia: China, South Korea and Japan. Many politicians believe the plan is on hold, but construction work to build ports and roads along the Napo is moving ahead. \"Compared to other big projects, it's being done in a low-key fashion,\" said Santiago del Hierro, an architect who is leading research on the impacts of the Manta-Manaus corridor at the Catholic University in Quito. \"It is moving ahead slowly but steadily, catalysing colonisation and deforestation in a similar way to the impact of oil extraction during recent decades.\" Already in the midst of one battle to protect their land, the people of Sani are now wondering whether they will be overwhelmed by this second front of development, which is likely to bring dredgers, riverbank erosion and increased traffic not just to them, but to the ITT initiative, the Yasuni national park and its last two uncontacted tribes, the Tagaeri and Taromenane. Unlike the Kichwa, those tribes remain deep in the forest and violently, often murderously, resist any approaches. \"I guess the river project could be an even bigger threat than the oil company,\" says Freddy Aviles, the outgoing manager of Sani Lodge, as he surveys the future challenges facing the community. I ask him if he ever wished his community too had resisted contact with the outside world. His answer suggests the conflict in Sani is within as well as among people. \"I think about that a lot,\" he said. \"If we'd never made contact, we would be free but we wouldn't have education or the chance for foreign travel. It depends on the type of contact. The lodge brings foreign visitors and they do affect the forest, but not like oil companies do. \"It's more sustainable. Other tribes that have worked closely with the oil companies have been changed. They now have cars and homes with metal roofs. Maybe we move more slowly. But there are some that have not made contact at all. And yes, I'm envious of them. Their lives are pure.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/joining-forces-sustainable-energy-for-all","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-19T11:59:54Z","webTitle":"Joining forces to achieve sustainable energy for all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/joining-forces-sustainable-energy-for-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/joining-forces-sustainable-energy-for-all","fields":{"headline":"Joining forces to achieve sustainable energy for all","bodyText":"For all those growing weary of grand proclamations, vision statements and big audacious goals that are made in the face of the world's many sustainability challenges, consider this one. The United Nations general assembly declared 2012 the international year of sustainable energy for all, recognising that \"… access to modern affordable energy services in developing countries is essential for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the millennium development goals, and sustainable development, which would help to reduce poverty and to improve the conditions and standard of living for the majority of the world's population.\" All very laudable as a high-level objective, but what does this mean in practice? The initiative has three interlinked objectives to be achieved by 2030: providing universal access to modern energy services; doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency; and doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Over the next two decades, the aim is to mobilise commitments from governments, the private sector, and civil society partners to take actions that will make sustainable energy a reality for all. But let's take a reality check. Providing universal energy access by 2030 is estimated to increase global energy demand by 179m tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) with 54% of this increase based on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2011. The report states that there are still 1.3 billion people living without access to electricity. The IEA calculates the costs of reaching universal access to electricity at $915bn (£583bn) overall or almost $46bn a year until 2030. Clear and stable legislative frameworks and financial incentives are yet to be developed that will enable private sector support. Uncertainties that abound over carbon pricing and differing attitudes to nuclear safety and renewable energy, hamper technical choices about how to invest in assets that will provide a return at an affordable cost of capital. For multinational energy companies, this represents both a clear challenge and an enormous business opportunity. Achieving the UN initiative's objectives will reach new customers, require construction of new distribution and generation assets, but these will need to be done without making energy unaffordable or increasing carbon emissions. Can the right market conditions be created to enable the private sector to invest and how should global companies engage with local stakeholders whose support is needed to ensure the investment thrives over the long term? A clear example of best practice is shown by EDF, whose Rural Electricity Services Company (Recso) partnership with the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME), has created a series of locally owned companies in countries such as Botswana, Mali and Senegal. The strength of these Rescos is that they are integrated in the local socio-economic fabric. They are companies governed by local law and employ local managers and personnel. Engagement with local stakeholders results in a business model that is supported by the communities it serves. The Rescos install, operate, maintain and renew the electricity supply equipment and installations such as small diesel generators and micro-network, photovoltaic solar kits, hybrid solar-diesel or biofuel-diesel plants and connection to the national network. EDF is involved as a \"start-up aide\", providing the capital and skills required for the creation and operation of these companies. When the viability of a Resco is guaranteed, EDF transfers its entire stake to its local partner, who will be responsible for the long-term running of the company. Other examples of successful partnerships to address sustainable energy needs include the work of the UK based organisation SolarAid. Supported by companies such as REC Solar and Vodafone Group, SolarAid helps with provision of solar study lights for students and their families living in southern and eastern Africa. In Uganda, SolarAid is installing a solar system on the community office of the Katine Project, a programme run by development charity Amref and the Guardian and funded by Barclays bank. Linked to this initiative, Barclays is also funding a four-year programme to bring solar energy to community centres, schools, clinics and communal buildings in rural parts of Kenya. Other corporate involvement includes Scottish and Southern Energy, who are funding SolarAid's Tanzania programme to train microsolar entrepreneurs. Extending energy generation and distribution is only one element in making more energy available to more people. The International Energy Agency estimates that by adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of construction technologies, global projected electricity consumption by buildings and industry could be reduced by 14% by 2030. Sharing and adopting these practices more widely among nations and industrial sectors can make energy more reliable and less expensive to homes and businesses. Examples of private sector action on building energy efficiency include the commitments made by global cement company Lafarge. Lafarge has pledged to develop 500 energy efficient building projects worldwide by 2015, which would also contribute to its objective of achieving sales of €3bn a year of sustainable solutions, products and services by 2020. Lafarge has held a long-running partnership with WWF International, with sustainable construction as a core focus area. The facts of the challenge speak for themselves. Without changing our current production and consumption patterns, the world economy is projected to need 80% more energy in 2050. For some, globalisation of corporate interests is seen as a danger to local stakeholders whose culture and independence is diminished as a result. But there are now clear examples of success by leadership companies, where realising a vision for commercial synergies, based on engagement and empowerment of local stakeholders, points the way towards achieving some of the grand objectives and challenges of sustainability.

The commerce department could impose heavier penalties in May, when it is due to decide whether China is dumping solar panels at prices below their actual cost. But Tuesday's move did not suggest the Obama adminstration is willing to risk a trade war with China in support of struggling solar panel manufacturers. Domestic solar panel makers, who had requested the tariffs, welcomed the decision, saying it had helped expose unfair Chinese trade practices. \"Today's announcement affirms what US manufacturers have long known: Chinese manufacturers have received unfair and WTO-illegal subsidies,\" Steve Ostrenga, an executive who is a member of the Coalition for American Solar Manufacturing, said in a statement. \"We look forward to addressing all of China's unfair trade practices in the solar industry.\" Solar installation companies, whose business relies on Chinese-made panels, expressed relief that the small tariffs would not drive up costs. \"This is a huge victory for the US solar industry and our 100,000 employees,\" said Jigar Shah, president of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy. \"Given all our expectations, this is really good news.\" But there were some suggestions that the Obama administration was sending a mixed message on its support for the renewable energy industry. Some industry executives had hoped for a greater show of support from the administration – even at the risk of causing a trade rift with China. Obama, in the White House and on the campaign trail, has regularly held up the renewable energy industry as an example of American innovation – noting that solar power was invented at Bell Labs. But China has now taken the lead, with more than 700 manufacturers of solar panels. A few of those Chinese companies have acknowledged receiving cheap loans and other government support. But low-cost solar panels are also helping some sections of America's clean energy industry. The energy secretary, Steven Chu, who was grilled on his department's support for solar power in Congress earlier Tuesday, proudly noted during his testimony that America overtook China in clean energy investment last year. The US made $56bn in clean energy investment in 2011, overtaking China, which invested $47.4bn. Much of the US investment represented the tail end of the 2009 recovery act funds. What Chu left unmentioned, however, was that the growth of the US clean energy industry was led by the plummeting costs of Chinese-made solar panels, which brought solar farms closer to the cost of electricity generated from fossil fuels. American imports of Chinese solar panels have grown exponentially in recent years, from $21.3m in 2005 to $2.65bn last year. But cheap Chinese solar panels have also put American solar panel makers out of business – and proved a political embarrassment for the Obama adminstration. The most high profile failure – and the one with the biggest political fallout – was the collapse of Solyndra, which declared bankruptcy after receiving half a billion dollars in department of energy loans. Another loan recipient, Evergreen Solar, embarrassed the administration by announcing plans to move production from Massachusetts to China because of lower costs. The company ended up going bankrupt. However, those failures still provided fodder to Republicans in Congress and candidates seeking the party's nomination to attack Obama for his support for clean energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"social-enterprise-network/2012/sep/12/muhammad-yunus-social-enterprise-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-12T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Muhammad Yunus: the model social enterprise leader?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/sep/12/muhammad-yunus-social-enterprise-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/sep/12/muhammad-yunus-social-enterprise-leader","fields":{"headline":"Muhammad Yunus: the model social enterprise leader?","bodyText":"Muhammad Yunus has been in the glare of the media's spotlight for all the wrong reasons over the last two years. The Bangladeshi government's none too subtle attempts to effect a de facto nationalisation of the Grameen Bank fare sadly all too well known. No one knows where it will all end and I fear we are looking at a bad outcome unless there is a change of heart by the Hasina regime. Yunus is no saint, has made mistakes and no doubt will make more. Arguments will continue to rage about the complex impacts of microcredit and the pros and cons of the for-profit and non-profit models. His hard line on the definition of a social business is not for everyone. But his achievement is immense. Eighty million people, about half the population of Bangladesh, are users of Grameen services. Whether urbanites downloading their apps on to their Grameen phones or the street beggars who can borrow interest free, Yunus's social business group reaches into all corners of his country. Now that, my social enterprise friends, is what you call mainstreaming. Bangladesh is a very different place to the UK, where I write this and all social entrepreneurs journeys are unique but there are some leadership lessons we can all take from Yunus as we continue to find ways of creating a socially enterprising world. Consistency and resilience The Grameen group is incredibly diverse. Microfinance, savings, insurances, eye hospitals, mobile phones, solar energy, high nutrition yoghurt. The list goes on and on. But two things have never changed. The rejection of charity as a solution to poverty and the drive to create financially viable enterprises, owned by the poor themselves, based on high-volume, low-margin products and services. In a land with no public sector grants to keep the salaries paid or super-rich hedge fund mangers dabbling in social innovation, there is little choice but to be inventive when it comes to business models, but Yunus's breaking of the NGO or private business paradigm is impressive. So, social enterprise leaders, keep the main thing the main thing and pay close attention to your business model. Courage It has passed into legend that Yunus was told he was mad to lend money to poor people with no contracts or collateral. I love his willingness to start, not waiting for the perfect answer before taking that first step. He is a congenital starter and this is what is needed in a country like Bangladesh where the needs of people are so acute. \"The future of the world will not invented on an Excel spreadsheet, Liam\", Paul Bennet of IDEO said to me when we sat with some of Grameen's village borrowers. Yunus embodies this \"let's jump in and experiment because actually no one knows what the solution looks like yet\" spirit. As Elvis Presley should have said: \"a little less conversation a little more action social enterprise people!\" Scale and opportunism Not for Yunus the interesting little boutique social experiment. His purpose is to \"put poverty in the museums\". He wants it big and he wants it now. Some of his businesses are brilliantly original ideas but others are copied from elsewhere. His superbly efficient and successful eye hospitals, for example, are copies of Aaravind's superb model in India. Innovation is overrated. Sometimes someone else has the great idea and your job is to execute it brilliantly where you are. The poor of rural Bangladesh don't give a hoot that Yunus didn't invent the care model that has given them back their sight. They are just delighted that their cataracts are gone. Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn said recently: \"A first mover is not the first one to launch; it's the first one to scale.\" That is so true and Yunus is very much a first mover in that sense. Anyone can have a bright idea at his or her computer or social innovation boot camp. Inventing stuff is the easy part. There is no shortage of great ideas. Executing the buggers is the trick that is so hard to pull off. Developing channels to the people who need the service on a mass scale and normalising it – now that's the really difficult bit especially in so-called bottom-of-the-pyramid markets. Relentless networking and giving people time Over 30 years, Yunus has created a global ecosystem including heads of state, business leaders, entrepreneurs, opinion formers, grassroots innovators and citizen organisations. And thank God he has. In his hour on intense need, as a corrupt and corrupting government regime seeks to ruin him, his network has been galvanized to action. I have no doubt his enemies would have tried to put him in jail or worse without his allies and friends around the globe as well as at every strata of Bangladeshi society speaking out. Despite the praise and awards heaped on him Yunus has not become one of those leaders who checks out how important you are before deciding how much of his time you are worth. I have spent many hours with Yunus at all sorts of events and he gives wide-eyed students as much of his time and attention as he does to presidents and chief executives. Many's the late night when I've stood there knackered as he gives yet another 18-year-old career advice. He wont leave a venue – ignoring my frantic watch pointing and finger across the throat signals — before everyone has had their book signed and their photo taken with him. (Oh yes, I forgot that bit – he has somehow found time to write bestselling books.) Not for Yunus the VIP social entrepreneur \"sorry you're not on the guest list\" elitism of the kind that goes on at, say, the Skoll World Forum or World Economic Forum. Great storytelling Yunus has a great facility with words and is a compelling storyteller and phrasemaker. His ability to use simple language to cut through to the chase about poverty and the structures that oppress people is a mark of that leadership calibre which attracts people to join his mission of eradicating injustice. How prescient this zinger from the early days: \"the question is not \"Are people credit-worthy\", but rather, \"Are banks people-worthy?\" I use that all the time when I speak to bankers. Let us hope against hope that the government of Bangladesh does not extinguish the lights of Grameen. But Yunus's legacy is secure. He has inspired millions around the world to rally to the cause of the poor. His 2006 Nobel prize acceptance speech is well worth a read: \"We get what we want, or what we don't refuse … we wanted to go to the moon. We went there. We achieve what we want to achieve. Let us join hands to give every human being a fair chance to unleash their energy and creativity\". Liam Black is co-founder of Wavelength and president of the Friends of Grameen.

Will it be a success? In my opinion, yes. To be sure, the negotiations have been lengthy. Even now there is more disagreement than agreement on the details of the so-called \"outcome document\" that will emerge. Yet that will not be the defining measure. Far more important is what the Rio conference has already accomplished. And that is to build a global movement for change. Rio+20 is a milestone on a long road. The famous 1992 Earth summit put sustainable development on the global agenda. Today, we have come to a broader and more nuanced understanding of this age-old imperative: how to better balance the development needs of a growing world population – so all may enjoy the fruits of prosperity and robust economic growth – with the necessity of conserving our planet's most precious resources: land, air and water. At Rio, more than 100 heads of state and government will join an estimated 25,000 participants to map our way ahead. For too long we have sought to burn and consume our way to prosperity. That model is dead. At Rio, we must begin to create a new one – a model for a 21st century economy that rejects the myth that there must be a zero-sum trade-off between growth and the environment. Increasingly, we understand that, with smart public policies, governments can grow their economies, alleviate poverty, create decent jobs and accelerate social progress in a way that respects the earth's finite natural resources. In this larger sense, I believe that momentum for change is already irreversible. The evidence is all around, hiding in plain sight in countries large and small, rich and poor. Barbados, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and South Africa, among many others, are already adopting \"green growth\" strategies that use limited natural resources more efficiently, create jobs and promote low-carbon development. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Kenya, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Senegal and Ukraine are applying new green-growth technologies in a variety of industries, from agriculture to tourism. China has committed to supply 16% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020 and plans to invest more than $450bn in waste recycling and clean technologies under its current five-year plan. In Brazil, waste management and recycling employs more than 500,000 people, most of whom live on society's margins. Under its new National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, India has begun paying people to better manage natural resources, such as forests and fresh water. Wherever you look, national and local authorities are adopting principles and practices that, taken together, could help move us from a prospect of environmental ruin and growing social inequality toward a new era of inclusive and balanced sustainable growth. Governments and nation-states are not alone in driving this transformation. At Rio, more than 1,000 corporate leaders from all continents will deliver a common message: business as usual no longer works. Many are members of the United Nations Global Compact – volunteers in a growing private-sector movement that understands that 21st century corporate responsibility means corporate sustainability. Thus Nike has initiated a new programme called Mata no Peito – a Portuguese colloquialism for \"taking on a challenge\" by helping protect Brazilian forest ecosystems. Unilever has pledged to source all its raw materials from sustainable sources by 2020. Kenya's mobile network provider Safaricom has integrated gender equality into its internal policies to create a mother-friendly environment. Meanwhile, Microsoft has announced it will soon go carbon-neutral. China's Broad Group produces non-electric air conditioning units that are 200% more energy efficient; it is now diversifying into other energy-saving products and sustainable buildings. ToughStuff from Mauritius seeks to bring affordable and reliable solar energy to 33 million people in Africa by 2016, and the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company is working to provide rural electrification in Afghanistan and the South Pacific island nation of Tonga. Energy will be a major focus at Rio. I call it the \"golden thread\" that connects the dots to a sustainable future – the key driver for development, social inclusion and environmental protection, including climate change. That is why, in 2011, I established a new initiative called Sustainable Energy for All. Our aim: to ensure universal access to modern energy services for the one in five people worldwide who lack them; to reduce energy waste by doubling energy efficiency; and to double the share of renewables in the global energy mix. In Rio, leaders from government, business and civil society will announce a galaxy of actions to advance these goals, from promoting cleaner, more efficient cook-stoves to helping governments scale up their geothermal and other renewable energy potential. Sustainable Energy for All is the partnership model of the future. The principle is simple but powerful: the United Nations uses its unrivalled convening power to bring all relevant actors to the table so they can work in common cause for the common good. At heart, this is what Rio+20 is all about. Yes, the negotiations themselves are very important. Agreements that can be committed to paper today will shape the debates of tomorrow. But Rio+20 goes beyond that. It is the expression of a dynamic global movement for change – and a big step forward toward the future we want."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2012/jul/20/amc-week-in-review-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-20T20:25:25Z","webTitle":"AMC's week in review: drilling down into homicide stats | Ana Marie Cox","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/amc-week-in-review-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/20/amc-week-in-review-drilling","fields":{"headline":"AMC's week in review: drilling down into homicide stats","bodyText":"What gets covered on the news is not always what you need to know. Here's a look at what you think you know – and what you should know. Colorado shooting. Wall-to-wall coverage of violent crime can give the impression that people in similar situations have something to worry about, but it's important to remember that shootings like the Aurora tragedy are incredibly rare, and that those most likely to become alarmed – people who go see midnight movies in suburban movieplexes – are among the least likely to have their lives touched by violent crime. To begin with, the broadest and most comforting statistic: since 2000, homicides involving three or more victims have made up less than 1% of all homicides each year. What's more, people comfortably about the national average per capita income of about $27,000 see just 10.2 completed violent crimes per 1,000 people. (The median household income in Aurora is $61,570; Aurora's Arapahoe county per capita income of $28,147 is the ninth highest the state.) As for preventing such crimes, calls for stricter gun control are well and good, but wealth and other demographic indicators skew crime data so radically that it's difficult to determine if tougher gun laws lower violent crime. Department of justice studies suggest comprehensive approaches (pdf) – involving community outreach, addiction counseling and employment programs – have the best chances of lowering gun crime. Nationally, gun crime has been on the decrease, even though no one knows exactly why. Romney's tax returns. Come November, will people remember Romney's refusal to release tax returns beyond the two years he has already given out? Democrats' energetic attempts to turn Romney's reticence into a campaign issue has yet to have an effect on the polls: Romney is actually making some modest gains in the polls. A USA Today poll showed that a substantial majority of respondents say that Romney should release more returns – 54% to 37% – but they are evenly split as to whether or not tax returns are relevant. Romney also has a good argument that two years should be enough: John McCain only released two years; Jimmy Carter just one year, and seven candidates didn't release any tax information at all – with George McGovern and Richard Nixon providing only \"general financial statements\". But Romney's lack of tax transparency isn't the real issue: the paperwork lacuna plays into a larger sense that Romney, and the wealthiest Americans in general, play by different rules than the rest of us. Voters say that Romney's personal wealth doesn't make a difference in their decision (73%), but 53% say that his policies would favor the rich. By contrast, voters are split almost equally as to who Obama's policies benefit (21% say the rich, 22% the middle class, 24% the poor and 25% would benefit everyone equally). More bad news for Romney: while he is one of the ten richest presidential candidates in the past 20 years, none of the other nine actually won the office. \"You didn't build that.\" As much as the left has been hammering Romney on tax returns, conservatives have been crowing about Obama's \"anticapitalism\" statements of this week. The Romney campaign spliced together a version of the remarks that emphasized – some would say, unfairly emphasized – Obama's contention that people do not succeed in business without the assistance of others, including the government. What does it all mean? Being white and male and married (pdf) is still the best way to ensure career success in America: you're more likely receive the kind of mentorship that Obama referenced, as well as promotions and raises. To the extent that the government offers a leg up: the federal governmentt gave $91bn in contracts to small businesses last year, making up 21% of all small businesses eligible for them. Almost half of all Americans receive some kind of government assistance. But these are just facts. Dave Weigel at Slate gets at what matters more: the \"didn't build that\" soundbite was \"a statement that reveals not what a politician believes, but what you already feared, in your bone marrow, that a politician believes.\" Polls support the idea that Obama is a \"big government\" politician and that this reputation hurts him: 37% say it's a reason to vote against him; and among independents, that feeling is even stronger, with 42% agreeing. But national polls can be misleading, and the difference in the impact of Obama's \"big government\" policies in swing states shows why the Obama campaign probably isn't sweating over this week's meme too much: just 34% say that the former is a reason to vote against Obama and 30% say it's a reason to support him. What story did you miss this week that matters more than any of the above? Juliet Eilperin, who covers politics, the environment, and science for the Washington Post, points to her story about the calving of the Petermann glacier on Monday. The glacier is now closer to land than it has been in 150 years, dramatic and tangible evidence of global warming – as if this season's record heat was not driving home the point enough. Adding salt – or, rather, oil – to the wound, a Shell Oil drilling ship became unmoored and almost ran aground in Alaska on the same day. Activists have pointed to the near-miss incident as evidence of the dangers of arctic drilling, but Shell is still set to start drilling next month, with the blessing of the Obama administration. Even if companies avoid further accidents, drilling alone hurries along global warming – and not just because of the oil that comes from it. The drilling also produces natural gas, likely to be burned off, producing \"black carbon\" that intensifies the greenhouse effect in the air and darkens the Arctic soil, allowing the surface to absorb more solar energy. If you're looking for good news in all this, it's that more people will come to believe in climate change and move to do something about it. Right now, the number of Americans who believe climate change (pdf) is the No 1 environment problem we face is waning, even though 72% believe that temperatures will rise over the next 100 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/masdar-eco-city-abu-dhabi","type":"gallery","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-26T16:35:57Z","webTitle":"World's first zero-carbon city: Masdar in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/masdar-eco-city-abu-dhabi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/masdar-eco-city-abu-dhabi","fields":{"headline":"World's first zero-carbon city: Masdar in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/21/germany-feed-in-tariff","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-21T12:39:08Z","webTitle":"UK can learn from Germany's feed-in tariff lessons | Greg Barker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/21/germany-feed-in-tariff","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/21/germany-feed-in-tariff","fields":{"headline":"UK can learn from Germany's feed-in tariff lessons","bodyText":"There's no denying that Germany has been a real pioneer in building a competitive low-carbon economy. Its renewables industry supports 340,000 jobs and replaces €5bn (£4.3bn) worth of energy imports per annum. The UK's record on the deployment of renewables is pretty dismal by comparison. However, the coalition is determined to turn that record on its head. To underpin our ambitious roll-out of green energy we will be looking closely at Germany to see how we can do better in the UK. We said we'd be the greenest government ever, and we mean it. So I am heading to Germany today for two reasons. The first is to hear from this renewables powerhouse the lessons it has learned from its well-established feed-in tariffs (Fit) scheme in order for the system we inherited to work better for industry, households, small businesses and communities. The second is to share the blueprint for our \"green deal\" - the biggest ever shake-up in home energy efficiency the UK will have ever seen. The Fit scheme rewards people financially to generate and export electricity they produce from renewable sources like solar panels and wind turbines and is here to stay in the UK, but we can certainly improve the scheme the coalition inherited from the last government. Because the scheme has been running longer in Germany, they've already learned some important lessons which we want to hear about. Just as the solar industry has seen a massive boom from Fits here, it's seen a spectacular increase in Germany too. How we manage this will be crucial to the sustained growth of the industry and to the level of financial support we give to householders, communities and small businesses. I am particularly interested in how hearing from the Environment Ministry how Germans are adjusting Fits to cope with the rapidly falling costs of solar technology. Taking a pro-active approach to changing tariffs will allow us to avoid the boom-and-bust approach we have seen in other countries and will allow us to capture the benefits of cheaper solar to support more household and community schemes, and a wide range of technologies including community-based wind and hydro and anaerobic digestion on farms. Improving the way the scheme operates will form a key part of our comprehensive review of the Fits that is now underway. The rising oil price has brought in to sharp focus the vital need for the UK to have reliable energy supplies. We need a mix of low-carbon energy to protect ourselves from volatile fossil fuel markets and disruption to supplies from unrest abroad. There is no choice but to have a sustainable energy source that we can guarantee will be there for us when we switch on the lights. One of the most overlooked and underrated weapons in our energy security armour is energy efficiency. Reducing energy demand will be crucial to cutting bills and managing supplies. In short, it's the energy we don't use which will be the most reliable. This is why the coalition is introducing the green deal. Germany is keen to hear more about our plans. I will be speaking at an event in Berlin today outlining our approach and the business opportunities it could bring for the UK and Germany alike. Germany has a similar challenge in reducing emissions. Their public and private buildings account for almost 20% of their carbon emissions compared to around one-quarter here. We're already progressing the energy bill through parliament which will lay the foundations for the green deal; it entered the House of Commons last week. Come 2012, householders will be able to access finance to pay for the upfront cost of having cavity walls filled or expensive measures like solid walls treated. Our aim is to make homes across the country warmer to live in and cheaper to run. Both our countries are determined to make strides in cutting emissions and while the oil price continues to be high, it is only right we learn from each other on the best way to meet our climate goals while at the same time stimulate our economies. • Greg Barker is the UK climate change minister"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/12/microfinance-roles-future-developing-world","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-12T13:00:00Z","webTitle":"Examining the roles and future of microfinance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/12/microfinance-roles-future-developing-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/12/microfinance-roles-future-developing-world","fields":{"headline":"Examining the roles and future of microfinance","bodyText":"Having a bank account and credit card seems normal to many people, but for more than 2.5 billion people in the developing world, it is almost unimaginable. Excluded from the formal financial sector, they have no access to savings or current accounts, credit or other basic types of financial services. Ending this exclusion has long been seen as a way of lifting the poorest people out of poverty. Microfinance took off around 30 years ago with the launch of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, founded by the banker, economist and Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus, and was based originally on the idea of providing small loans to poor people to enable them to invest in their own livelihoods. The concept of microfinance has gained widespread support among policymakers, and been lauded for its potential to transform lives. But it has also come under closer scrutiny in recent years, with some questions raised about the effectiveness of microloans in particular as a way of combating poverty. A Guardian roundtable discussion, held in association with Barclays, provided an opportunity to debate these issues, examining the role of microfinance as we move towards a post-2015 development agenda and addressing some fundamental questions about its purpose, the forms it should take, and how it can be scaled up. Participants at the roundtable included representatives from Barclays, Plan International and CARE International, who joined forces in 2009 to form Banking on Change, an initiative to expand financial inclusion in Africa, Asia and South America by increasing participation in village savings and loans associations (VSLAs). These grassroots, community-managed schemes enable people to save as a group, accumulate funds, and borrow from the fund at rates of interest agreed by the group. They help individuals smooth over any financial bumps, making them more resilient to emergencies and eventually paving the way for many to enter more formal financial services. Expanding financial services NGOs and large banks are not obvious stablemates but, as this alliance has shown, they can work together successfully where they share a common interest. In fact they need to because, as the roundtable heard, no single institution has all the skills and capacity required for a project as ambitious as expanding financial services to several billion new people around the world. \"With 2.5 billion still excluded, we can't broker every deal one by one,\" said Christine Svarer, head of private sector engagement at CARE International UK. \"We recognise that a global bank like Barclays has expertise that we haven't. Ten years ago, profit was a dirty word for NGOs like CARE. We're certainly different, and partnership is something you need to work at, but we have commonalities.\" Another difference now compared with 10 years ago is a greater diversity of views of what microfinance should do. The debate heard how many experts now think the assumption that poor people in developing countries want to invest their way out of poverty made a convenient business case for microfinance, but was misguided because it potentially exposed people to debt they couldn't repay – and not everyone can be an entrepreneur. These days, microfinance is increasingly diversifying into other instruments such as savings-based vehicles, which better suit the risk-averse. This signals a maturing of the industry, and a move towards a greater number of business models to create what Tom Sanderson, UK director of the charity Five Talents, described as the \"financial fabric\" of developing countries, where there still isn't much intertwining of financial products. But it also means that the players in this sector increasingly need to find their own place in a more diverse landscape. One theme discussed at the roundtable was the need for institutions to ask themselves some fundamental questions about what they offer, and how it improves on any existing community-based models. \"One implicit assumption is that external institutions can add value,\" said Hugh Allen, CEO of VSL Associates, a consortium of microfinance practitioners specialising in VSLAs. \"Community-based systems have the advantage of speed and accessibility. They're based on sensitive, deep understanding of their clients. They know each other. Unless as a financial institution and partner you can compete on those grounds, you aren't going to go far.\" This is a challenge for big players, and the roundtable heard via an internet video link from Michael Kaddu, head of corporate affairs at Barclays Bank of Uganda, that this is why the bank's approach has been to work through VSLAs as a more relevant form of support. \"We give the group access to money but they manage it themselves,\" he explained. \"If individuals are ready to graduate from that, they'll have greater financial literacy. They are the risk managers and they approve the loans. It helps them understand how the financial sector can be open and transparent.\" But what is the ultimate objective of microfinance? There's a certain tension between the need for providers to make a return – the financial sustainability – and the good they ostensibly do by offering services to the poor. Kaddu emphasised that Barclays' motivation is to create sustainable change, working with communities for their benefit but also with a view to a return on investment. Those two objectives are not always clearly reconciled all over the industry. Anton Simanowitz, social performance management specialist at Oikocredit, gave the example of microfinance providers in Nigeria focusing on entrepreneurs in Lagos, because that was more profitable, even though there are huge numbers of people in rural areas who might benefit from those services. Financial inclusion and social change don't always go together, he pointed out, but if you start from the social goals you want to achieve you can look more clearly at where to add value, and how. In other words, just offering small loans or savings accounts to whoever wants them isn't enough: the financial service element needs to be bound up within a social programme if it is to achieve lasting positive change. The charitable microfinance organisation Finca, for example, has provided microfinance in the form of \"micro-energy\" loans, where people in Uganda were able to buy solar-energy systems for their homes, which enabled children to study at night and also helped people to start new business lines, such as mobile-phone charging. Embedding financial services into specific social benefits like this can deliver positive results faster and on a larger scale than isolated credit is likely to do. Microfinance on its own may not have any explicit social benefit at all: a loan can be just a loan, and nothing more. \"There are some very different players, with different motives,\" agreed Steve McGuire, vice president and chief financial officer at Finca. \"You can't just focus on providing financial services; you have to champion financial inclusion within a social programme for your clients. We're very focused on the double bottom line of financial sustainability and social benefits.\" Serving communities The roundtable participants agreed that developing a diverse microfinance sector would require more collaboration – and in some cases, a willingness to step back and let someone else do it. \"Segmentation is important,\" said Bob Annibale, global director of microfinance at financial services firm Citi. \"It's about looking at which institutions and models are serving communities well. It's important to look at local banks, co-operatives and credit unions. They go deeply into rural areas. We bring a certain experience, but it's about bringing in the fuller banking sector and technology from other sectors like mobile phone companies to complement it.\" With the UN's 2015 target to free people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations – known as the millennium development goals (MDGs) – fast approaching, the roundtable went on to discuss how best to harness the transition into the MDG's successor, which are known as sustainable development goals (SDGs), and create a space for microfinance within those goals. Microfinance is a cross-cutting theme, taking in issues of education, livelihoods and gender, the roundtable was told. As such, it can be woven through the SDGs, but some predicted challenges in getting it on the table. \"I think it will only be possible to get a couple of large-scale ideas into the mix,\" said Graham Baxter, senior adviser on inclusive business at the International Business Leaders Forum. \"You need quite a big chunky idea, but I think there should be a place for the concept of financial inclusion.\" Others saw potential for pushing microfinance within a jobs and livelihoods agenda, or education. But whatever place it finds within the next round of development goals, everyone at the roundtable agreed that this was an important and exciting time for the sector. For some, that excitement was about the diversity of financial services that the sector could go on to provide in developing countries; for others, it was the prospect of real social change among disempowered people. \"It means we can move away from a victim-based view of the world to an opportunity-based view,\" said Allen. \"We've been talking about self-reliance forever, and I think now we have the opportunity to achieve it.\" Key discussion points Around 2.5 billion people lack access to formal financial services. Microfinance has been held up as a way to lift people out of poverty, and initially it focused on providing small loans to allow people to invest in their own livelihoods. As we head towards a new set of development goals in 2015, there's an ongoing debate about what microfinance should look like. The sector is diversifying beyond microcredit, notably with more savings-led approaches to help the poorest people build up assets. New cross-sectoral partnerships are also emerging, offering the potential to deliver more innovation and greater scale.

Fulfilling a promise in Brazil's constitution to have a federal capital built in the country's hinterlands, President Juscelino Kubitschek ordered Brasília's construction as part of his \"fifty years of prosperity in five\" plan of the 1950s. Brasília emerged out of no where in Brazil's tropical savannah quickly, with its original construction completed in less than four years before its inauguration in 1960. The locus of Brazilian modernist architecture, Brasília reaps its share of admiration and scorn. Many of the most important government buildings along the city's wide central avenue, Eixo Monumental (Monumental Axis), have been remodelled and updated to cope with the city's heat. It's superquadras, rows of six-story apartment buildings that from an aerial view give Brasília an appearance of an airplane or butterfly. Often panned for their Orwellian atmosphere, the superquadras now are among the city's most prized real estate. For others who work in the city, the cost of living means long commutes or train rides from far-flung suburbs. The growth of the city far exceeded the expectations of Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa, lead architect and urban planner. But success has also led to strained water sources, poor air quality, and devastation of the cerrado landscape in which the city is located. Green building could help this city of 2.6 million recover in the long run. To that end, the city celebrated the opening of an ultra-modern building that houses finance offices and a leading environmental organisation that is slated to gain Brasília's first LEED certification. Other LEED buildings in the city centre are on the drawing board. Brasília's new northwest sector, or Setor Noroeste, is the laboratory for sustainable development. While superquadras include one long shopping boulevard that discourage residents from walking or cycling, Noroeste will have shopping areas every two blocks. To that end, more pedestrian walkways and 44 kms (27 miles) of bicycle paths will allow residents to ditch cars. Building design will allow for solar energy to electrify the homes on sunny days, while reserves of natural gas will power them during cloudy days. To address concerns that the city will run out of fresh water supplies by 2025, efficient rainwater capture systems will harvest much of the city's 60 inches of annual rainfall. And in a creative bid to reduce municipal waste, urban planners have proposed residents separate their garbage and dispose of it into bins connected to giant vacuum tubes that will quickly transfer them to waste treatment plans for recycling. Residents will receive a handbook that will instil environmental awareness while explaining the rules, including only allowing water heating from solar energy and limiting landscaping to native plants. Not everyone is impressed with the Setor Noroeste plan. Critics point out that the land on which Noroeste will be built is on a water table that supplies much of the city's water and replenishes nearby Lake Paranoá. The plan was rushed without a thorough environmental review. Others point out that in a city where there are 2.3 residents for each car, moving parking spaces from the surface to underground garages will still encourage residents to rely on their own cars. And with a high cost of living, homes in Noroeste aren't affordable for most Brazilian families. Brasília's move towards a more sustainable city will be bumpy. But as Brazil's global stature rises and more Brazilians, as well as expats, move to this young capital, there is hope and ambition of green living.

Plenty for the new head of communications to be getting on with, whoever it shall be. Many questions arise from the debacle, and here's one: what next for the hero of the hour, Giles Fraser, the canon chancellor who did the right thing and walked out? Well, there are possibilities, for Southwark Cathedral is right now choosing a new dean to replace Colin Slee, who died last November. It's late in the day. But there are 11th-hour calls for the authorities to draft Fraser in as the new dean. Supporters say he would be a strong candidate, high profile, liberal, a good media performer, charismatic – and he knows Southwark diocese. He was vicar of Putney for nine years before moving to St Paul's. He'd even be able to look out of his window in the dean's house, next to the Globe on London's South Bank, with a fine view of the dome of St Paul's just across the river. With the right wind, he might one day hear the evensong of the bailiffs, wrestling with protesters, ripping down their tents. • To Westminster now – where it is Labour's position, and it is a reasonable one, that if you really want answers on the environment, you really want the secretary of state. So Labour was pretty put out when minister Greg Barker was fielded by the government to explain the coalition's decision to cut the subsidy available for households to harness solar energy. Not only is that cut unfair to householders of modest means, argued the climate change shadow Caroline Flint, but it also threatens jobs and businesses in what should be a growing industry. It's not that Labour has anything against Barker, but they do take exception to the secretary of state Chris Huhne, who apparently sought to mollify the party's opposition by offering Flint a chance to talk about it privately on Sunday evening. \"She said no to the chat, and told his team that cosy Sunday night chats weren't the way to do business, and that with thousands of jobs on the line, the Commons should have the chance to debate things properly,\" a source tells us. With his hopes of a cosy stitch-up dashed, the debate took place, and Labour gave the coalition both barrels. Barker took the hit; and Huhne was nowhere to be seen. • It's amazing – some turnaround, some life. Ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton, here revealed and disgraced in 1996 as \"A liar and a cheat\" over the cash for questions scandal: now elected to the national executive of Ukip.

Or Neil. • And as the phone-hacking hearings continue, there is well-earned posthumous triumph for the News of the World, vindicated by convictions arising from Mazher Mahmood's exclusive about cricket match-fixing allegations. Dark days ahead for the players themselves and, of course, for Pakistani cricket. Nothing for officials to do but rebuild the team and hope in time to rebuild a reputation. And they might change the name of the Gaddafi cricket stadium in Lahore to something else. • Finally, yesterday's reference to Fred \"Nutty\" Sharpe, head of the Flying Squad in the 1930s and star of a new history of the unit, brings further recollections of the man who made DC Gene Hunt from TV's Life on Mars look like Larry Grayson. In his memoir, Nutty pronounced on the newly arrived migrants from eastern Europe in the early part of the last century. They were, he observed: \"Russians in top-boots, leather leggings and fur hats; wild-looking people from the most outlandish parts of that great uncivilised land.\" Bad, plain bad, they were. \"A lot were desperadoes and went in for crime straight away.\" But it wasn't all bare-knuckled stuff with Nutty. Raiding an illegal club in the West End in the 20s, he showed he could be quite stylish: \"I went to the Manhattan Club in evening dress and opera hat with a friend who was a man about town,\" he recalled. \"The music stopped as the cry went up 'It's a raid'.\" They seemed to take it \"as a lark, for it gave them a thrill. But they changed their views when they appeared before the beak.\" Collars were felt; the law prevailed. And Nutty didn't hit anybody. • This article was amended on 2 November 2011 because the original said Greg Clark explained the coalition's decision to cut the subsidy available for households to harness solar energy.

Buffett's MidAmerican Energy Holdings will take over Topaz Solar Farm, which is expected to produce enough power to run 160,000 homes when it is up and running in 2015. The farm, halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, is the world's second-largest photovoltaic plant under construction and is expected to generate 550-megawatts of electricity or about half the power of a nuclear reactor. The deal comes hot on the heels of a string of green energy investments by the famous investor. MidAmerican, which is part of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway empire, is the largest wind energy provider in the US where it operates more than a dozen wind farms. MidAmerican sealed the deal for Topaz on Wednesday, a day after the seller, First Solar, failed to secure a US government loan guarantee for the project. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but First Solar's difficulties securing funding for the vast project suggests Buffett probably got a good deal. First Solar will continue to build the farm on behalf of Berkshire and it is due to open in early 2015. Greg Abel, chief executive officer of MidAmerican, said: \"[Topaz] demonstrates that solar energy is a commercially viable technology without the support of governmental loan guarantees.\" Analysts suggested Buffett is moving from wind to solar power to take advantage of lucrative tax breaks. Gerard Reid, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \"The reason for the move from wind to solar is very simple. Tax credits for wind in the US expire at the end of next year, while solar ones run till 2015.\" In February Buffett, the world's third-richest man, said he was keen to make a fresh wave of \"major acquisitions\". \"Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy,\" he told investors in his annual letter to shareholders.Last month he ended his moratorium on investing in technology, taking a $12bn (£7.5bn) stake in IBM, the 100-year-old tech firm.

In answer to a slide asking \"what is the most important issue facing Britain today?\", top of the pile was our old friend the economy. Followed by jobs. Down the list we went. Immigration, crime, inflation, petrol prices, equality. Spluttering in at the bottom with 3% of the vote was pollution/environment. If it had been an election, the environment would be lucky to get its deposit back. But the result didn't surprise anyone in the room. Most of my working hours (and quite a few of my social ones) are spent with people who care passionately about the environment. Politicians who care, scientists who care, community groups, NGOs, businesses, students - they understand what's at stake and each, in their own area, work to ensure we protect and value the world around us. Even so, I doubt many of them would call the environment their most immediately pressing concern. That slot is more likely to be filled with more personal matters – parents getting older and more infirm, a child's intermittent attendance at school, or the declining quality of the local sandwich shop. There are immediate priorities for us all that come before the big stuff. That doesn't mean we care less about the big stuff – in fact it helps explain why we care so much. The environment may not top the polls as the most important issue facing this country today, but it remains vital, not just in its own right, but to all the concerns higher up the list - our economy, our jobs, fuel prices, immigration and everything else. At the Guardian Open Weekend, there was debate about whether our current austerity means holding off on trying to secure the environmental action we need. New analysis by Green Alliance of recent public opinion polls and surveys shows that the British public don't think that way. They understand that one issue doesn't cancel out or take priority from the other – they perceive the complex role the environment plays in our lives. They may tire of an apocalyptic hit parade where the public must choose the most worrying winner between terrorism, economic collapse and environmental disaster, but they see quite clearly how the issues surrounding the environment affect their lives. In fact, Green Alliance's analysis says that people react more strongly to opportunities than to oblique threats, and that \"people are more motivated by the prospect of a positive low-carbon future, than by thinking about an unwieldy, distant problem.\" Austerity hasn't made people care less about action for the environment - it's made efficiency the \"new normal\". The analysis shows growing support for energy efficiency, recycling and food waste reduction. It's also striking that an Asda poll revealed that the most concerned among their customer base are not the most affluent. It was those from the lowest incomes who care \"very much indeed\" about being green. The public understands that energy prices are an environmental problem. The same Asda poll showed only 5% blamed renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures for rising bills. The majority blamed energy companies raising prices or the global price of fossil fuels. Meanwhile, a YouGov survey commissioned by the Sunday Times showed three-quarters of respondents arguing that the government should use more solar energy than at present, and 60% of respondents said the government is right to subsidise wind energy. Also, returning to my downbeat first example, it's important to point out that polling also showed the public understands the difference between national and global issues. When asked about the environment as a global problem, it scores higher than the economy. The government has a mandate for action here. Polling may not be the key to the human soul, but it tells politicians where they will find support and businesses where they will find customers. The polls are clear - we want our government to act and businesses to respond. We want the government to realise we're capable of being concerned about more than one thing at a time. We want a strong economy and a sustainable future - and we believe we can have both. • Alastair Harper is a senior policy adviser at Green Alliance.

In America, many reasons are behind the slow resurgence: improved design and performance, painful restructuring, and new technologies such as hybrid or electric vehicles that push innovation. Meanwhile, America's auto competitors across the pond hold their own. But while tecchies and green transport mavens marvel or mock new developments in hybrid, EV or alternative fuelled vehicles, another business trend is changing how automobile manufacturers are conducting business, running their operations and planning long-term strategies. Companies including General Motors, Volkswagen, and Ford now invest in renewable energy projects. Most are small and experimental considering the size of these corporations; others are aggressive and reach the scale of Google's investment in energy projects. Some schemes fall in line with the development of an infrastructure for electric vehicles; others look towards the future to guarantee energy security or to meet regulatory pressures. Volkswagen by far has been the most aggressive company on this front. With a goal to overtake General Motors and Toyota as the world's largest automaker by the end of the decade, renewable energy is now part of the firm's strategy. Its €1bn (£862m) investment in two offshore North Sea wind farms is a step to meet the company's renewable energy goals, hedge against future volatile energy prices and score some corporate social responsibility points. All the while they will also be boosting Germany's fitful wind power sector. Across the pond, American automakers are making small yet notable investments in renewables. Earlier this summer, the General Motors (GM) subsidiary GM Ventures announced an equity investment of £7.5m in Sunlogics, a solar energy systems company that will install solar panel charging canopies at GM facilities and Chevrolet auto dealerships. While renewable energy only accounts for 1.4% of its energy consumption, GM's incremental investment in solar energy will lead to 60 megawatts of annual power by 2015 – the equivalent of powering 10,000 homes a year. The company also evaluates how it can fuel its manufacturing plants more efficiently and cleanly. For example, GM retrofitted one of its Michigan plants so landfill gas could power its operations 40% of the time. That conversion will save the firm $1ma year in energy costs. Ford Motor Company has taken more of a public-private partnership approach towards renewable energy. A solar power generation system at its Michigan Assembly Plant (MAP) received mostly state and federal funds with a small contribution from Ford, and that project will save the company $160,000 a year. The MAP renovation was just one small part of a modernisation plan that will cost Ford at least $550m. MAP is the first automobile factory in the world that manufactures gasoline powered, hybrid electric, plug-in and battery electric cars all on the same line. Ford also operates experiments throughout its global operations, including energy storage projects at its MAP facility and wind turbines that toil above European factories. Other plants were not included in Ford's transformation, but some have been redesigned for other purposes. Ford's Wixom plant, for example, was for decades Ford's most profitable factory, churning out Lincolns and Thunderbirds. Ford closed the factory a few years ago, and now it is slated to become a renewable energy research and development hub. As companies develop more automobiles that run on technologies other than the internal-combustion engine, it is only logical that they design, assemble and market these cars in facilities that are powered by energies other than fossil fuels. For Volkswagen, GM and Ford, any investment in these technologies, from a few hundred thousand to €1bn, is still a risk. And despite the hype and excitement, hybrids, electric and plug-in hybrid cars are still only a tiny sliver of these companies' total sales, as consumers overall still have not warmed to them. Nevertheless, as fossil fuels rise in price and consumers' tastes evolve, the smart money is for more of these new cars to roll out, in part, manufactured thanks to the energy technologies of the future.

The softly spoken farmer and father of six lives in a tidy compound of houses, all wood and corrugated iron, among the cool, misty hills outside Nairobi. But thanks to Shamba Shape-Up, a reality show that does for Kenyan farms what Extreme Makeover does for homes, Mungai is a minor celebrity here in Limuru. \"[The programme] has taught me to practise better farming,\" says Mungai, 54, during a break from filming on a damp May day. \"I've learned to plant potatoes well … poultry keeping, dairy farming. It has almost doubled my yields.\" Perhaps more importantly, Mungai has also become a teacher. His neighbours are always popping over, eager to learn his secrets so they can likewise boost their farming yields. Shamba – the Swahili word for \"small farm\" – Shape-Up combines reality show staples, such as celebrity presenters and snappily cut sequences set to mood-lifting music, with expert advice on soil fertility, disease prevention, solar energy and financing. \"Agriculture is the absolute backbone of Kenya and the livelihood for many people,\" says David Campbell, the show's creator and director of the edu-tainment company Mediae. \"We have a potential 5.6 million rural audience for TV … but there is no agricultural information on TV. We want to establish a series that gives farmers information in an educational and entertaining way.\" Mungai's farm was given a \"makeover\" in the first episode, aired in March. He told the presenters he had a problem with maize storage, and said his cows were skinny because feed was too expensive. His wife Lucy complained that the chickens entered the kitchen and ate the food, and his children said they couldn't do their homework because the kerosene lamps ran out too quickly. One daughter wanted a shelf to put washed dishes on. Presenter Naomi Kamau looked to her co-host Tonny Njuguna, a well-known actor, and he nodded and said: \"Let's go do it!\" A soil test was carried out, fertiliser was recommended, a chicken coop was built, maize storage was improved, solar lamps provided and kitchen shelving built. The crew has returned to see how Mungai is doing. He says he is getting a much better price for his maize, and his potatoes are thriving. Two red-topped solar lamps are recharging on top of a water tank. Campbell, who has worked in media, development and agriculture in east Africa for more than 30 years, is scathing about what he sees as the failure of some donor-funded research organisations to pass on knowledge to people in the field. \"The developed world spends very little money communicating with farmers,\" he says. \"They spend millions on research and, frankly, they haven't got much to show for it.\" \"We thought the big research institutes would jump on [the show] as a way of scaling up their information. We have had, especially in the livestock area, absolutely no participation. However, the next series does see icipe research coming on board on biological control methods of crop pests.\" Shamba Shape-Up has received $600,000 from the African Enterprise Challenge Fund (AECF), a private-sector organisation. The investment is in matching funds, so Campbell has to raise an equal amount before the AECF disburses its share. Other sponsors include the Africa Soil Health Consortium, Britain's Department for International Development, soil fertility group IFDC, Cabi, FSD Kenya, livestock product manufacturers Cooper K-Brands Ltd, agri-business Syngenta and solar lighting company d.light designs. The first series, which will end in June, reaches about 4 million people in Kenya; the team hope to bring in 3-4 million people in Tanzania and 2 million in Uganda with the next series. Campbell, who also created the successful Kenyan educational drama Makutano Junction, is convinced he has chosen the best medium. \"We saw from Makutano Junction … how huge the TV audience in rural areas is,\" he says. \"We have a 7.2 million audience for Makutano Junction; 70% of that is rural.\" Shamba Shape-Up gets up to 3,000 SMS messages after each show, with many viewers requesting information leaflets. \"Wonderful show,\" writes one viewer on the programme's Facebook wall \"I hope Kenyans will learn from it. The impact that you guys will make is huge.\" Campbell wants to turn the programme, which is broadcast on Citizen TV in English and Swahili, into a self-sustaining business. \"Once we've done research … we'll be able to say: 'Hey, look, if only 10% of our [7 million] viewers adopted a practice and they earned an extra $200 or $300, then multiply that and you get $210m going back into rural communities'.\" Njuguna, 39, who also starred in Makutano Junction, says the show made him realise how little he knew before. Like many Kenyans, even those who live in cities, he also has a shamba where he grows maize and vegetables. \"I thought I knew everything,\" he laughs. \"I was shocked to learn that you have to go through a lot before you start thinking of planting something … In Kenya there are so many people who don't know what it entails – the planting, the variety of seed, soil PH, testing of the soil and all that.\" Mungai, meanwhile, has earned both money and respect from the show. He is determined to encourage others to adopt new practices. \"I saw myself [on TV],\" he says, his head bowed shyly. \"It was lovely. [My children] wondered how I managed to bring in these people. They have realised I know many things.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2012/apr/20/invest-green-energy-abundance-project","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-20T21:58:04Z","webTitle":"Invest in green energy for just £5","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/apr/20/invest-green-energy-abundance-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2012/apr/20/invest-green-energy-abundance-project","fields":{"headline":"Invest in green energy for just £5","bodyText":"A new website has been launched with the aim of enabling people to invest from as little as £5 in green energy projects and enjoy an attractive return. Abundance describes itself as a \"community finance platform\" allowing small investors to put money into UK renewable energy schemes and receive a regular cash return based on the energy produced. It is looking to raise money from consumers tired of the old banking model who want their cash to be used to help fund green projects and facilitate change. And it says rates of return are expected to average 5%-9%, depending on the type of scheme in which the money is invested. Abundance is currently aiming to raise £1.4m to build a wind turbine on the edge of the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, and has plans for further renewable energy schemes – solar and hydro – around the country. The platform says it works in a similar way to \"peer-to-peer\" lending websites such as Zopa - as a middle man, getting investors together with community groups and companies that want to build environmental projects. It collects the money and organises the payouts to investors in return for a 1.9% fee paid by the body that builds and operates the project. Individuals can invest as little as £5 in each project, or as much as £50,000. Abundance is marketing itself on the basis that some investors will put in enough to produce a return each year that will cover their annual electricity bill – typically £500 a year. Bruce Davis, the site's co-founder, and one of the founders of Zopa, describes the website as democratic finance in action. \"We are enabling small investors to produce a regular return from the generation and sale of 100% green electricity from wind, solar, hydro and other renewable energy sources,\" he says. \"Abundance is like a building society for the 21st century which enables our customers' money to go directly into projects generating growth and revenue in the real economy.\" As with most such schemes, investors should go in with their eyes open. Abundance is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. However, in the (probably unlikely) event that the body operating it went bust, investors would become creditors and could lose some or all of their money. Davis believes the overwhelming majority of people want a greater say in where their money goes and how it is invested. Those who put their money in will be buying debentures, which are like official IOUs issued by the individual energy projects. In return, the project commits to pay the individual a share of the profits it makes from generating green energy. Returns, paid twice a year, will be variable, and based on the amount of energy produced and the price it is sold for. The original investment is paid back over the lifetime of the debenture or as a lump sum at maturity. Construction of the 500kW Forest of Dean wind turbine is getting under way. The company that will operate the turbine and pay out the returns, Resilient Energy, has planning permission, and the turbine is expected to be up and running in September. Investors have three months to decide whether to invest in that project. Once that is subscribed, it will move on to other projects that need funding. Although the investments will typically run for 20 or 25 years, if you want to get your money out before the end date, Davis says there will be an eBay-style bulletin board on the website allowing investors to sell their debentures for a mutually agreeable price to a willing buyer. He claims that once buyers see the returns on offer, there should be no shortage of people willing to take over the investments. \"Those buying into the scheme will be able to log on and see how much electricity the turbine has produced and what their share of the payout will be,\" says Davis. He acknowledges the growing number of community hydro schemes featured in Guardian Money in recent years, but says the main advantage his scheme has over some of those is the flexibility to invest small sums and the ability to get your money out. \"We want this to be open to everyone, which is why we have set a minimum investment of just £5.\" • A solar energy scheme in Bristol this week launched a community share issue that aims to raise £87,000. The not-for-profit, community-owned Bristol Energy Cooperative plans to install almost 200 solar panels on community buildings in the city. The newly formed co-operative hopes to attract hundreds of members investing as little as £50, and to deliver a return of up to 4% a year. It will initially concentrate on two sites: Hamilton House in Stokes Croft, a community arts facility, and Knowle West Media Centre, a media and arts charity. Bristol Energy Cooperative has been supported by the Co-operative Enterprise Hub, which offers free advice, training and access to finance for new and existing co-ops. The share offer closes on 18 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sustainable-business/dubai-sustainability-inspiration-city","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-13T14:09:15Z","webTitle":"Can Dubai ever be sustainable?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/dubai-sustainability-inspiration-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/dubai-sustainability-inspiration-city","fields":{"headline":"Can Dubai ever be sustainable?","bodyText":"In the Middle East, The Doha Debates is a cutting edge television forum for Arabs to discuss the hottest political and social issues around and beyond the Arabian Gulf. In late 2009, one of its topics was This House Believes Dubai is a Bad Idea. And on that same day, Dubai's neighbour, Abu Dhabi, tossed a lifeline to Dubai in the form of a $10bn (£6.4bn) loan to assist the emirate out with its tangled finances. As the global economic crisis festered in Dubai with decimated property values and abandoned construction projects, much of the world indulged in schadenfreude, with countless observers announcing that a place like Dubai should never had existed in the first place. But Dubai is roaring back. The Arab spring's aftershocks convinced many companies to relocate to the city and surrounding region of 2 million people because of its stability. Other firms are attracted because of the proximity to some of the world's largest markets, from Europe to the emerging economies of Africa, India and East Asia. What was once a sleepy trading port now bursts with opulent malls, towering skyscrapers and a web of highway overpasses. The Emiratis have not just mastered the Arabian desert: they bludgeoned it. And now more citizens and expatriates peer through the haze and wonder if this rapidly growing city's built environment can become more sustainable. Oil and gas account for only 5% of Dubai's economic output, but visitors would think otherwise when in the city. Developments in the newer section of Jumeirah were built for the automobile, not pedestrians. Dubai Metro, the city's futuristic rail network, is impressive but its two lines still leave much of the city unserved. Driving means endless U-turns, not more convenient left turns, that can add several miles to what should be a direct commute. No one seems to mind, however, because petrol is cheap. Emiratis clearly benefit from Dubai's revitalisation, and many expatriates fare better here than they would in their home country. So the focus is on the now, not the future. And yet the steps to a greener Dubai are underway. Earlier this year, local leaders unveiled a 48 sq km (18.5 sq miles) solar energy park that promises 1,000 megawatt capacity upon completion. The local energy authority is mulling strategies, including a carbon market scheme, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling bins are slowly rolling out among the villas spread across the city. Sustainability professionals, both local and from around the world, are setting up shop, seeing ample opportunities in a city that many outsiders would just assume to leave dead. A local green building council boasts a bevy of events; so far, however, more ideals than actual projects can be counted. One huge project that claims it embraces green building is Dubai Pearl, a £3.8bn development that promises the luxury expected in Dubai with more environmentally responsible construction. Its builders say the complex will attain LEED gold certification. Restaurants and residences will have to separate food waste for collection. Its overall design will incorporate reduced electricity and water consumption, a tall order because both are highly subsidised and therefore offer residents no incentive to conserve either resource. Up to 35% of its space will be landscaped to provide green space that is currently lacking outside of local golf courses. Finally, the project aims to be socially responsible, an issue crescendoing throughout Dubai because of routine allegations over the abuse of migrant labourers. When I visited the construction site, prominently displayed signs boasted that not one workplace injury had occurred. Dubai still has a long road to travel until the reality of sustainable living matches the rhetoric. Emiratis are tired of the constant criticism heaped on its city and are understandably sensitive about outsiders telling them what to do. And expatriates, 85% of the population, are hardly models of green behaviour and show little sign that they have a stake in a city in which they live and work only temporarily. But the inspiration to heal Dubai is infectious. The hard part will be the actual implementation.

Think of them as jobcentres with crème brûlée macchiatos. The government clung to last week's pledge from the US multinational to create 5,000 jobs in the UK like a French sailor to the Raft of the Medusa, during a week in which official forecasts showed the economy flirting with recession and the governor of the Bank of England warned the banks to build up their defences against the euro's meltdown. The prime minister personally gave Starbucks' five-year plan a thumbs-up, describing its plans to pave paradise with 200 US-style drive-thru stores as \"a great boost for the British economy and the local communities that will directly benefit from these openings\". You can't blame him: in these grim times, with unemployment at a 17-year high of 2.6 million, and the cull of public-sector workers from George Osborne's austerity drive now expected to top 700,000, any new private-sector jobs have to be welcomed. But the reality is that the coffee cup is still half empty. Starbucks' announcement came on the same day that construction company Carillion told 4,500 staff their jobs were at risk because of government plans for a dramatic cut in solar-energy subsidies. And to inject some reality into proceedings, while the Starbucks jobs are being created over the next five years, the march of Tesco across the UK means that in an average year the retailer creates between 7,000 and 10,000 jobs. Starbucks' announcement equates to about five Tesco superstores. And these are not the kind of high-skilled roles the chancellor hoped to see being created in the new British economy, as it weans itself off debt-fuelled consumption, and turns instead to a newly flourishing industrial sector. There has been welcome jobs news from several manufacturers recently, including Jaguar Land Rover and Toyota; and Starbucks insists it's not just creating low-skilled, high-turnover \"McJobs\" but creating sustainable roles, and giving its new baristas shares in the business to encourage them to thrive. But with continental Europe, still our major export market, sliding into the doldrums, the enthusiasm with which Starbucks' announcement was greeted in Downing Street smacked of well-founded desperation. George Osborne said Britain's economic recovery would be powered by the \"march of the makers\". He didn't mean coffee-makers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/apr/06/tory-donor-topland-sued","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-06T19:09:26Z","webTitle":"Firm sued by ministry is Tory donor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/06/tory-donor-topland-sued","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/apr/06/tory-donor-topland-sued","fields":{"headline":"Firm sued by ministry is Tory donor","bodyText":"The Conservative party accepted a donation of £25,000 from one of Europe's biggest property companies, owned by two billionaire brothers, which the government accuses of deceit and bribery over an alleged property scam that cost the public purse more than £20m. The Ministry of Justice is suing the Topland Group, founded by press-shy brothers Sol and Eddie Zakay, amid claims that the firm conspired with a property agent in 2002 to extract inflated rents from the government on one of its central London buildings which houses the main London divorce courts. The case, which was lodged in May 2010 by the then justice secretary Jack Straw, is expected to last five weeks in the high court this summer. Topland and Eddie Zakay have denied the claim. Sol Zakay is not a defendant in the case. Despite the government accusing the company and Eddie Zakay of \"deceit, fraud by bribery, dishonest assistance and breach of confidence\" as well as \"unlawful conspiracy\" in 2010, a year later the Conservative party took £25,000 from Topland. The cash is a large enough amount to secure wealthy donors an invite to join the Tory treasurers' group where they can meet \"senior figures from the Conservative party at dinners, lunches, drinks receptions, election result events and important campaign launches\". There is no suggestion that Topland or Eddie Zakay sought to influence the government in exchange for their company's cash. The revelations come as the issue of party funding continues to haunt the country's political leadership. While Labour has been accused of being in hock to the unions, the Conservatives found themselves in the headlines last month when Peter Cruddas, the former Tory treasurer, was caught offering prospective donors access to David Cameron and the chance to influence policy. Although the Electoral Commission said no \"law or regulation\" had been infringed by accepting a donation from a company being accused by the state of bribery, Labour said the Conservative party had questions to answer over the Topland cash. Andy Slaughter, the shadow justice minister, who had come across the payment, said it was \"extraordinary for the Tories to be accepting donations from a company being sued by the Ministry of Justice on grounds of deceit and/or bribery and/or breach of confidence\". He added: \"It is inconceivable Tory headquarters would have been unaware of the ongoing case. The Tories need to urgently explain why such a donation was accepted. The public will also want to know what access was granted to Topland and its executives to either ministers or officials.\" The Zakay brothers are well known in the City but keep a low profile. The pair launched their business during the property boom of the late 1980s before expanding into the US and Middle East. They own a string of high-profile properties including a supermarket chain in Spain and a £1bn bet on Indian real estate. With a personal fortune of £2bn, the Zakays are building a hotel empire in the UK, buying the Hilton Brighton Metropole for £40m in 2011. Topland, with investments in solar energy and natural resources, is now one of Europe's largest property groups. Little is known about their politics – the Zakays have never donated to a party before last year. However Sol Zakay, the younger brother, appeared to vote with his feet and quit Britain after the introduction of a 50% tax rate on high earners by Labour in 2010 and went to live in Israel, advising the company as a consultant. Eddie, 61, became chairman of the UK businesses and remained in England. However in February this year Sol returned to become overall group chairman. Rarely seeking the limelight the brothers are best known for their support of Jewish care charities, attending lunches with Tory mayor of London Boris Johnson and Labour luminaries such as Lord Mandelson to raise cash for the elderly. However, they also received unwanted publicity when the details of the court case emerged in 2010, when it was first alleged by the government that a property agent entered into a conspiracy with Topland and Zakay to push the rent at First Avenue House in central London significantly above market rates. This allowed Topland, which then bought the property from Standard Life in October 2003, to benefit from the inflated rents, the government alleges. The building in question was leased by the ministry to house divorce courts. The claim has been denied. (http://www.estatesgazette.com/blogs/property-law/2010/05/straws-last-act---sue-zakay.html) When contacted by the Guardian, Topland refused to comment on either the donation or the court case. It did not respond to an email detailing the story. Topland's director of structured finance, Tom Betts, said the donation was \"news\" to him and said the company would not \"be commenting on the case\". A Conservative party spokesman said: \"This government has for the first time published a list of all ministerial meetings. It is quite right for ministers to meet with people and hear their views, but there is no question of individuals gaining an unfair advantage by virtue of their financial contributions to the Conservative party.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"careers/ernst-amp-young-is-hiring-in-the-week-08-11-10","type":"article","sectionId":"careers","sectionName":"Guardian Careers","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-10T11:41:56Z","webTitle":"Ernst & Young is hiring — In the week 08/11/10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/ernst-amp-young-is-hiring-in-the-week-08-11-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/careers/ernst-amp-young-is-hiring-in-the-week-08-11-10","fields":{"headline":"Ernst & Young is hiring — In the week 08/11/10","bodyText":"Accountancy: More than 300 jobs are to be created by accountancy and consultancy business Ernst &amp; Young, according to the Press Association.

Demonstrations kicked off nearly 24 hours ago in Australia. Hundreds of thousands of people in at least 150 countries took to the streets to demand that world leaders take immediate action on climate change ahead of the United Nations climate summit in New York City on Tuesday. Highlights from the day’s events: • Initial estimates pegged the amount of people at the New York City protest at more than 310,000. “It’s completely blown our expectations,” said Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, one of the groups that helped organize the march. • UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon joined the demonstration in New York City, an unusual move for a high-ranking official. He was joined on the protest line by Jane Goodall and Al Gore. • US secretary of state John Kerry issued a strong warning about the threat of climate change after the New York City demonstrations. Kerry said: “There is a long list of important issues before all of us, but the grave threat that climate change poses warrants a prominent position on that list.” • A study released on Sunday shows that the world is emitting record C02 emissions at “dangerous and irreversible” rates. • Emma Thompson effectively served as the London demonstration’s spokesperson. She told The Guardian’s James Randerson: “Unless we’re carbon-free by 2030 the world is buggered.” • Australia’s labor environment spokesman Mark Butler criticized Australian prime minister Tony Abbott at a press conference ahead of the Melbourne march. Abbott has refused to join the upcoming UN conference. • Australian Associated Press estimated that 30,000 people attended the Melbourne demonstration. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg has the latest on US secretary of state John Kerry’s evening speech to foreign ministers. Kerry said that climate change is as grave a threat to global order as Isil or Ebola. Goldenberg reports: The strong words from Kerry and the numbers in the streets elevated climate change to the top of the international agenda – at least for a few hours. Organisers had called the day of protests in order to put pressure on world leaders gathering in New York for a United Nations summit on climate change on Tuesday. It will be the leaders’ first such meeting in five years. Kerry, in remarks to foreign ministers of major economies, said climate change should rank as a top-tier agenda despite competition from more immediate challenges. “While we are confronting [Isis], and we are confronting terrorism and we are confronting Ebola, this also has an immediacy that people have come to understand,” he said. “There is a long list of important issues before all of us, but the grave threat that climate change poses warrants a prominent position on that list.” Numbers are in for the demonstration in Montreal, Canada: Campaigners crowd New York City during the mass demonstration to pressure politicians to take action on climate change ahead of Tuesday’s UN climate summit. Tomas Hachard writes for The Guardian about how climate change is being incorporated into modern cinema. As we have begun to see the effects of climate change more severely, more frequently and closer to home, so too have film-makers been spurred to address the consequences of an irrevocably damaged environment in new ways. In both fiction and non-fiction, climate change is no longer depicted as the eventual cause of future calamity, but a reality affecting everyday life. On the heels of documentaries that hoped to raise awareness by laying out the facts about climate change have come new ones showing the consequences of our behavior through spectacular images of an increasingly inhospitable environment. The New York City march is officially over and buses are rolling out of the area after a demonstration that far exceeded organizer’s, and the New York Police Department’s, expectations. Emma Thompson, Vivienne Westwood and Peter Gabriel joined campaigners and UK flood victims at the People’s Climate Change event in London. An estimated 40,000 people were there. Here is a gallery of the day’s events. Seen on the streets of New York City: The New York City march has wrapped up, though tens of thousands of people are still roaming the streets. End-of-protest notes from The Guardian’s on-the-ground observers: An aerial view of the People’s Climate March in New York City: Archbishop Desmond Tutu writes for The Observer, calling for boycotts of activities that support companies that burn fossil fuels, much like the protests leveraged against firms that conducted business with apartheid South Africa. Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a technical scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time. While global emissions have risen unchecked, real-world impacts have taken hold in earnest. The most devastating effects of climate change – deadly storms, heat waves, droughts, rising food prices and the advent of climate refugees – are being visited on the world’s poor. Those who have no involvement in creating the problem are the most affected, while those with the capacity to arrest the slide dither. Africans, who emit far less carbon than the people of any other continent, will pay the steepest price. It is a deep injustice. Photos Guardian reporters in London, New York, Paris and Melbourne have filed their report on today’s People’s Climate March, which has attracted hundreds of thousands of demonstrators across the world. Van Jones, an activist who briefly served as Obama’s “green jobs” tsar, said it was possible the march could, in hindsight, be viewed as an historic moment, much like the civil-rights era “March on Washington”. Sunday’s protests were at the very least an organising triumph for Avaaz, 350.organd a new breed of climate activists who are trying to reach out beyond traditional green constituencies. The day started in Melbourne, where demonstrators carried their giant Tony Abbott puppet in protest at his repeal of the carbon price. The usual call-and-response of “What do we want? Climate action. When do we want it? Now” was revised to “10 years ago”, by a crowd that felt it had already fought this battle. Here’s a look at the protests across Canada, collected by Guardian social media producer Kayla Epstein: The march’s New York City route takes demonstrators down Sixth Avenue, past the headquarters of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. Fox News is not devoting much, if any, time to cover the event. Marchers, however, still had a message for the conservative news network. The Guardian has just put together a nice gallery of the scene in New York City, one of the many cities worldwide holding gatherings ahead of the UN climate summit, where more than 120 world leaders will convene for a meeting aimed at galvanising political will for a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015 Event organizers have pegged the current New York City crowd estimate at 310,000 people. 350.org founder Bill McKibben is an event organizer: Guardian readers around the world have been submitting photos from their local climate marches. Kayla Epstein, social media producer at The Guardian, has collected some of the best photos. Contribute your own here, and be sure to tell us your location when you submit! El Palmar, Vejer, Cádiz, Spain Hong Kong Budapest People’s Climate March organizers in New York City said the crowd is much bigger than expected, reports The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg. Organizers said the crowds in New York Citywere much bigger than expected, filling 50 city blocks along the route, from 80th Street down to streets in the 30s. “It’s completely blown our expectations,” said Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, one of the groups that helped organize the march. “It’s filling the entire march route.” “This is many, many multiples of our expectations,” Patel said. He said organizers had to re-route the drone they were using for crowd estimates to take in all the people. The Guardian’s Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts on the scene at Rio de Janeiro’s climate march, which was besieged by rainy weather. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has been spotted at the demonstration. It is slightly odd that he is participating as these protests are meant to pressure world leaders ahead of the UN climate summit in New York City on Tuesday. Alongside Ki-moon, is primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, former US vice president Al Gore and the former prime minister of France, Laurent Fabius. To kick off the march, demonstrators held a moment of silence that erupted in a loud call to world leaders to “act now” on climate change. The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino reports from the ground: People from around the country and some from around the world have descended on New York City to sound the alarm for climate change. Kids, adults and the young at heart are in the march, demanding things like reduced carbon emissions, an end to fracking, divesting from fossil fuels, all under one clear global message to world leaders: act now. At 12:58 the crowd of 250,000 or more marchers with their hands in the air went silent. After a minute of silence, they erupted in loud cheers and chants to “sound the alarm” on climate change. Three generations McDaniels are participating in Sunday’s march. “These guys deserve a better future than the one they’re destined,” said Nikki McDaniel of New Jersey. Her sister, Carla Shannon, came with her children. Shannon said her son just learned about climate change in school and was very eager to participate. A look at the New York City march from the city’s rooftops: The world emitted a record amount of greenhouse gases this year, according to a new report in Nature Geoscience. It shows that the 2014 worldwide emissions are on course for a record high of over 40bn tonnes. As recently as 2010, that number was at 32bn tonnes. The Guardian’s Fiona Harvey reports: Scientists think climate change is likely to have catastrophic and irreversible effects, including rising sea levels, polar melting, droughts, floods and increasingly extreme weather, if temperatures rise more than 2C. They have calculated that this threshold is likely to be breached if global emissions top 1,200 billion tonnes, giving a “carbon budget” to stick to in order to avoid dangerous warming. Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, said: “If this were a bank statement it would say our credit is running out. We’ve already burned through two-thirds of our global carbon allowance and avoiding dangerous climate change now requires some very difficult choices. Not least of these is how a shrinking global carbon allowance can be shared equitably between more than 7bn people and where the differences between rich and poor are so immense.” The study, by the Global Carbon Project, also found that China’s per capita emissions had surpassed those of Europe for the first time, between 2013 and 2014. The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino is in the dense, slow-moving New York City march. Three generations of McDaniels came out to demand action on climate change. “These guys deserve a better world than what they’re destined to receive,” said Nikki McDaniel, the “cool” aunt. One of the lead organizers for the People’s Climate March, activist Bill McKibben, posted an update on the New York City marches pace. The protests in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil have been plagued by bad weather. The Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, Jonathan Watts, sent in some pictures from the scene. Martin Lukacs, an environment writer for The Guardian, is in today’s crowd in New York City. He sent in this photo of a parachute created by Oakland-based migrant justice group Culture Strike. The parachute symbolizes the way climate change disproportionately impacts people in the global south, making refugees of millions, as well as species like the Monarch butterfly, disturbing their migratory patterns. Julio Salgado, a member of the group and an undocumented artist, says he is thrilled by how much art he’s seen in the streets on the march. Actor Mark Ruffalo has been a leading opponent of fracking and is marching in New York City today. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg spoke with Ruffalo in the crowd. “The message is that we are here to demand that our leaders embrace the will of the people, and the will of the people is to make climate change a priority,” said actor Mark Ruffalo. He said it was important for people to realise the technologies to deal with climate change - such as renewable energy - were already here “The only thing they have to do is get out of the way.” The idea of the demonstration is to get UN leaders to act and Ruffalo - unlike a lot of climate watchers – is not cynical. He thinks that the UN summit would produce concrete results. “You can’t get 200 people together and not have something get out of it,” Ruffalo said. “It’s going to be huge. I don’t know exactly the effect, but I promise you one, five, 10, 15 leaders are going to come out of it, and do something. Somebody is going to be a hero.” Among the the thousands of protesters in New York City, a few signs (and a parasol and bubble) stand out: A branch of Colombia’s Ministry of the Environment is sharing images from the scene in Bogotá: Scientists met outside the American Museum of Natural History in New York City on Sunday morning to prepare for the march. Scientific American spoke with climate scientists, geologists and biologists about why they decided to join the event. “If the most well-informed citizens are not willing to act, what hope do we have of averting climate catastrophe?” says Pattanun “Ploy” Achakulwisut, a PhD student in atmospheric science. She enlisted other graduate students from Harvard University to join the march, partially with the help of a scientist / superhero poster exhorting scientists to “mobilize march [and] make history.” An organization called Science Stands rallied scientists ahead of the march and encouraged them to join. As paleoclimatologist Peter deMenocal of Columbia University puts it: the “modern climate is exceptionally warm relative to the last millennium, and future decades will be another world, unlike anything modern civilization has ever seen. This is a really sobering fact.” So he will be joining the march along with Columbia colleagues and his twin 8-year-old girls. “It’s important they witness that a lot of people care about this issue and are willing to do something about it,” he says. “This is about their future.” As the New York City march kicks off, here’s a look at today’s marches across the UK. The “small but determined” group of demonstrators in Brighton: From the town of Stroud in Gloucestershire: Neil Young just debuted a new environmentally-themed song on the Democracy Now! broadcast of the march. Click through to here an acoustic version of the track, Who’s Gonna Stand Up. CNN columnist John D Sutter is posting short profiles of New York City marchers on Twitter. People have travelled from all over the US to be a part of today’s events, with hundreds boarding buses and others taking the ‘People’s Climate Train.’ On Grist, Heather Smith writes about her experience taking the four-day journey on the People’s Climate Train from California to New York: It becomes apparent, after a while, that many of the people on this train are growing to hate us. The People’s Climate Train people make up about 80 percent of the passengers, so with their aisle-blocking, folksong-playing, Miseducation of Lauryn Hill-blasting, workshop-holding, and earth-centric arts-and-crafts making, there’s not much room for the usual pastimes of non-activist long-distance train travel — like sitting quietly and reading a book. Among the People’s Climate Train riders, opinions on this are mixed. Some worry that we are giving a bad impression of the movement. Others think that the Amtrak conductors are acting like total sticks-in-the mud. Guardian environment writer Martin Lukacs reports from the start of the demonstration: Under the banner of “frontlines of the crises, frontlines of change”, the head of the New York march will be led by a hundred youth from the communities most impacted by the root cases of climate change across the continent - including the Bronx, Jackson, Mississippi, and indigenous peoples from Canada, representing, in one spokesperson’s words, “the leadership of the future.” Hello, this is Amanda Holpuch in New York City, taking over the live blog from Adam Vaughan in London. People have gathered in Manhattan this morning ahead of the city’s march, which starts at 11:30am local time. Demonstrators hope to pressure world leaders to take more significant steps to address climate change – just before the United Nations climate summit is held here in two days. The Guardian’s US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg is at the New York City march, along with environment writer Martin Lukacs and reporter Lauren Gambino. Nearly 500 buses have brought in demonstrators from other US states and Canada, but Guardian reporters will also be filtering in information from marches across North and South America. If you are on the ground at any of these marches, please share your thoughts with me on Twitter (@holpuch) or by email: amanda.holpuch@theguardian.com An estimated 27,000 people turned out in London. Actor Emma Thompson led the march with other celebrities and the Bishop of London gave a speech saying “of course” climate change was a moral issue and it was time to act At least 8,000 people marched in Paris, despite poor weather Marches took place in several other UK cities, including Manchester, Newcastle and Edinburgh Thousands more people took part in marches in Brussels and Berlin That’s all from me for today - I’m handing over the live blog now to Amanda Holpuch in the US, who will be blogging as the New York march gets underway in less than half an hour. Here’s a literally colourful video interview by Arthur Neslen in Brussels, with Sanjeev Kumar, 40, founder of Change Partnerships, an environmental NGO Karl Mathiesen has been talking to locals in Paris who point out that while around 8,000 people (the latest police estimate) is a respectable turnout, it’s not that high given the city’s reputation for protest. He writes: Antoine Heron, a Parisian and retired engineer said the march was big, but not compared to the social actions for which Paris is famous. “It’s not so big as if it were something about salaries and political matters.” He said Parisians were anxious to see a global agreement come from the UN conference which will take place in their city next year. “We don’t want to have the same problem that we had in Copenhagen. Nations need to make decisions,” he said. Our South America correspondent, Jonathan Watts, has been out at the march in Rio de Janeiro, where a few hundred people have been marching. He writes: Several hundred marchers in Rio have braved the rain and wind that has cleared the beaches of Ipanema. Not a bad turnout considering how allergic Cariocas usually are to even the slightest drizzle. All ages and colours. Samba drummers knocking out a good rhythm as marchers sing “Ruralista acabando com o bom senso” (the agro-lobby are finishing off good sense”). Many on this “Caminhada Pelo Clima” - which has been organised by Avaaz - are waving flags with green hearts supplied and bearing banners that read: “zero deforestation”, “100% clean energy” and “reduce, recycle and reuse”. Renata Perrone, who has a green heart painted on her cheek, said it was a good turnout considering the rain. “ This is my first march. I’m here ‘cause it’s important, something everyone should care about. The more people join, the stronger we are. Brazil is not doing enough. No country is doing enough.” Democracy Now is live-streaming from New York. They’re currently interviewing Bill McKibben of 350.org. He’s stressing the diversity of the march’s make-up, which includes a contingent of scientists: Scientists are sick of not being listened to, for 25 years they’ve been telling us what’s going on, but no one’s paying attention They’ve reached the point where ‘if they won’t read the freaking papers we’re putting out, we come out and tell you’ Journalist Tom Wills, who was at the London march, calculates there were around 27,000 people on the capital’s march, which puts it around the same size as Melbourne’s turn-out. His calculations are in this Google spreadsheet. Our US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, has been out celeb- and politico-spotting in New York. She says that actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who was recently appointed as a UN climate envoy, is expected to join the march, along with actor Susan Sarandon. This is Suzanne pictured with what looks very much like anti-fracking campaigner, Mark Ruffalo, who this week called on Barack Obama to ban fracking ahead of Tuesday’s climate summit. Some more pics from Bibi van der Zee in central London, who’s been talking to marchers. Mother and daughter Maureen and Adaesi have come to the march together. “My children are around somewhere too,” says Adaesi. “We’ve come because something has to be done,” says Maureen firmly. “The government has to take action, and we have to take responsibility too - to buy less and live down a little.” Damian Carrington writes: Victoria Bamford, a 66-year old gardener from Wales, who left her home at 6am to join the London march. “We are on a knife edge now in every way.” She has noticed changes in the climate in her work. “You cannot rely on the seasons any more, and plants are getting stressed and ill. I’m no bloody expert, but we have to tackle the fossil fuel business. But I don’t think the government is doing anything.” Karl Mathiesen in Paris says the march is around 1.5km. Police are putting the number of marchers at around 3,000 though organisers believe it may be higher. Brussels has been busy too, albeit if not on the same scale as London. Our European environment correspondent, Arthur Neslen, has been down to a march there: About 2,000 people braved heavy rain in downtown Brussels to fire off a message for urgent climate action to world leaders at the New York summit. The protest was smaller than expected after police instructed organisers to postpone it for 24 hours because of traffic concerns. That synched it with Brussels’ annual car-free day – but also, the dramatic end to a Belgian indian summer. Even so, a mostly young and energetic crowd danced in the downpour behind a samba fanfare all the way from the Palais de Justice to the Belgian finance ministry. Here’s the audio of the Bishop of London’s speech, courtesy of James Randerson: We are living on an Earth in an interconnected world, we live on an ark... the people in the first class cabins will not long remain impervious to the impact on poorer people in steerage, it’s just one world in which we inhabit Karl Mathiesen in Paris writes: Maryk Reesink and her daughter are Parisians who are anxious to see a global agreement struck in their city next year. Reesink says action on climate change is very important but she is pessimistic. “The politics in France is not occupied with this question. That’s why I’m here. I hope it can change things. I find it a nice idea to make many manifestations around the world. That it is something global that is moving.” Speeches have begun in London, starting with the Bishop of London. In Berlin, three marches are converging on the Brandenburg Gate. Here are a couple of marchers: In Edinburgh, former Telegraph environment correspondent Louise Gray highlights this choice slogan: There’s also a small march taking place in Newcastle. One of our Australian bloggers, Alexander White, has written a post on the today’s marches and the “tipping point” that he believes climate campaigners are approaching: This global event is an amazing confluence of international civic action, a full twenty-four hours of people power calling for the de-carbonisation of our world. The fact that it can happen at all is a reason to be a climate optimist. ... It is heartening that increasingly environment groups are joining forces with other civil society groups like unions, faith groups and development agencies. Internationally, unions are building a global campaign under the banner “no jobs on a dead planet”. These alliances and campaigns in civil society, as well as ones in the business world, are the start of a positive civil society “tipping point”, guided by the optimistic hope that we can still act to stop global warming. The front of the London march has reached Parliament Square - but other marchers say they are still stuck all the way back at Temple... There are still two and a half hours until the New York march, but preparations are well underway: London is far from the only capital with impressive crowds. Karl Mathiesen, our man in Paris, says there are thousands of people out on the streets there. Wow, Thompson is having a busy day, and fast becoming the de facto spokeswoman for the London march. “Unless we’re carbon-free by 2030 the world is buggered,” she tells the Guardian’s James Randerson. Listen to the full interview here: Sky News has just been interviewing Emma Thompson as she walks the final few minutes to parliament. Whilst I’ve been aware of climate change for many years, seeing the effects of climate change written so clearly on that exquisite landscape [on my trip to the Arctic] put a rocket up my arse. I’ve been being lazy. I’ve been working in poverty reduction but this issue affects everything. Thompson didn’t realise she was live on TV and her ‘colourful’ turn of phrase prompts an apology to viewers by Sky’s journalist. Asked why climate change isn’t higher on the political and world agenda, she says: News outlets and fourth estate are very much controlled. I’m not suggesting there’s a conspiracy, but there’s a great deal of control over what kind of news goes out in what way. Those of who want to know what’s going on in the world have to explore quite carefully and forensically about what’s going on. I think what it is is we don’t make the connections. Climate change is connected to all events, in particular war. It’s quite hard to get a handle on the size of the crowds in London. A Metropolitan police spokesman couldn’t give me an estimate on numbers but said a “proportionate policing plan is in place”. Avaaz, one of the organisers, told me previously that they were expecting potentially north of 10,000. The green NGOs and Green party are out in force in London today, as you’d expect. There are also some well-known campaigners, such as gay rights activist Peter Tatchell: At the London march, Bibi van der Zee sounds the alarm at Brand’s apparent no-show (see 09.28) ‎People streaming down nearby roads to join the demo. It is going to be an extremely good turn out. No sign of Russell Brand yet though. Some concern he may have overslept. Karl Mathiesen has been talking to some of the participants at the Paris march. He writes: “We are here to push the negotiations to understand that you cannot speak about climate without speaking about the ocean,” says Catherine Chabaud, the French sailor and journalist who twice circumnavigated the globe solo twice and is now an adviser to the French government on ocean health. Chabaud will tell the crowd at today’s Paris march that the ocean’s organisms are responsible for supplying half of the world’s oxygen and that the health of the sea is vital to combatting climate change. “Of course we have to reduce emissions, but we also have to develop solutions for the oceans.” She says reducing the pollution flowing into the sea from industry and the creation of marine protected areas are important climate tools. The London march has set off from Temple towards parliament, with some of the celebrities at the front: And this from our head of environment gives a good sense of the scale of the turn-out: And here, some of the shapes being thrown on the march: “We’re calling for leaders to step up on Tuesday in New York and start making serious pledges to emissions cuts,”Alex Wilks, campaign director at Avaaz, one of the London march’s organisers, tells James Randerson. Here the full interview here: And Emma Davies, one of the marchers - “it is happening and some people are pretending it’s not happening, and that’s just not right” Elsewhere, here are the crowds in Stroud, Gloucestershire: And ‘Mr Frackhead’ has made his debut in Manchester: The marches are getting ready to set off towards parliament in London: In London, speeches are scheduled to start around 2pm. First up is the Bishop of London, and there will also be addresses by the designer Vivienne Westwood and Alice Hooker-Stroud of the Centre for Alternative Technology (which was celebrating its 50th anniversary recently, and of which we have a very nice feature on here). Some more colourful marchers and fun placards in London: And in Munich, too: Naomi Klein says she’s beginning to think the marches “are going to be huge” In Manchester, Friends of the Earth is organising an anti-fracking march outside the Labour party conference. Apparently they’ve created a huge puppet called Mr Frackhead - I’ll look out for photos later. The group’s head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, says: The UK’s environmental credibility has been sinking for years. The government has been bending over backwards to develop fracking and extract more dirty gas and oil, instead of investing in the UK’s huge renewable power potential and a cleaner future for us all. Meanwhile, in London, the Guardian’s head of environment, Damian Carrington, notes the symbolism of a high tide coinciding with the marches: Marchers are already gathering in serious numbers in London: James Randerson, the Guardian’s science and environment news editor, is down in London. He’s been talking to Oxfam’s campaign director, Ben Phillips, who says climate change is “not just about nature, it’s about human beings”. You can listen to his interview in full here: “UCL claims to be one of the greenest universities in the world yet has millions in fossil fuels,” say students, staging a demonstration in the UCL quad to demand divestment from fossil fuels by UCL and other institutions, reports Bibi van der Zee in London. “This institution is supposed to be about the future of the world but is profiting from its destruction,” they say. A large banner reads “UCL put your money where your mouth is - divest from fossil fuels”. In Paris, organisers are hoping for thousands of people to turn out, despite poor weather (which also affected Perth, Australia). The Guardian’s Karl Mathiesen reports: Avaaz campaigners in Paris expect “several thousands at least” at the march starting at 2pm local time at la Place de la République. The Facebook page for the Paris march has 5,500 people signed up to attend. “30,000 people turned up in Melbourne,” said one Avaaz employee, “so we hope it can be big here too.” But organisers say it will depend on the weather which looks like it is clearing up after heavy showers this morning. Crowds are building up in Manchester, where it looks like the march is benefiting from the decent weather forecast across most of the UK today: And the Guardian’s Bibi van der Zee has bumped into a carbon bubble. It’s a metaphor for the carbon bubble some campaigners fear is building up - read more here for an explainer. Meanwhile, in New York, where the march isn’t even due to start until 11.30am local time (4.30pm British summer time), the media have already arrived for what is expected to be by far the largest of all these global marches: On the subject of world leaders, here’s the French president, François Hollande, pictured on Saturday receiving a petition from campaigners Avaaz, which has been signed by over 2m and calls for the urgent forging of “realistic global, national and local agreements, to rapidly shift our societies and economies to 100% clean energy by 2050”. Ricken Patel, the group’s executive director, calls it “the most important petition we’ve ever done”. The BBC has more on Ban Ki-moon’s unusual step of joining the New York march later today (as our correspondent Fiona Harvey noted earlier in the week, “high-ranking officials do not normally attend mass public protests”). Mary Robinson, former UN special envoy, told the BBC: I think the Secretary General recognises that this is for everyone, and it is important that in every country civil society comes out and puts pressure on their leaders to make the changes necessary so that we will have a safe world. He doesn’t see the marchers as them and the insiders as being an us, rather he sees the two as part of building a momentum, it is civil society asking their leaders to be more ambitious. The BBC’s Matt McGrath notes that several major countries are not sending heads of state to Ban’s summit on Tuesday, but there will still be more world leaders at his meeting than were at the landmark Copenhagen climate talks in 2009. The leaders of China, India, Australia, Russia and Canada won’t be here. Observers believe the meeting can still achieve political momentum. After all, there will be more leaders in New York than in Copenhagen in 2009 when hopes of a last minute deal were dashed in confused and rancorous discussions. Protesters have recreated an oil spill in front of a BP-sponsored exhibition at London’s British Museum, the Guardian’s Bibi van der Zee tells me. She writes: Last month a US judget found BP guilt of gross negligence and bore clear responsibility for the Deepwater oil spill four years ago. The protesters, a group called ‘BP or not BP’, unrolled a long strip of black material and dressed up as dying pelicans, dolphins, turtles and out-of-work fishermen, in order, they said, to highlight the ongoing costs of the oil spill. And here’s some video from Bibi (apologies for the quality). London students: there are plenty of demonstrations taking place outside universities right now, including at LSE and UCL, calling for divestment from fossil fuels. Timings and locations here. Time for another photo roundup, from Genoa in Italy... ...to Barcelona, Spain... ...and Zurich, Switzerland, yesterday: Down under in Australia, Guardian Witness users have been sending in updates. Submit yours here. A close-up of that Blue Mountains banner from earlier: And marchers on the move in Adelaide: Naomi Klein, the activist and author whose new book is about climate change and capitalism, writes in a comment article for the Guardian that the “true leaders” on climate change are not those at the UN summit on Tuesday but those in the streets today. Is it a stunt? Well, sure, all protests are. But the mere act of expressing our collective sense of climate urgency goes beyond symbolism. What is most terrifying about the threat of climate disruption is not the unending procession of scientific reports about rapidly melting ice sheets, crop failures and rising seas. It’s the combination of trying to absorb that information while watching our so-called leaders behave as if the global emergency is no immediate concern. As if every alarm in our collective house were not going off simultaneously. She also reprises one of the themes of her book, that it is not top-down governmental approaches or business that hold the key to tackling climate change, but grassroots movements: Sunday’s climate march will serve many purposes for its many participants: meet up, boost morale, exert political pressure. But sounding the alarm together will help us bring our actions in line with our emotions. So many of us are scared of what is happening to the world around us; for one day, we will come together and show it. Yes, we will be showing that sense of existential urgency to our politicians. But we will be showing one another. By sounding this people’s alarm, we will also be saying that we are no longer waiting for politicians to declare climate disruption an emergency and respond accordingly. We are going to declare the emergency ourselves, from below, just as social movements have always done. Musician Jarvis Cocker, meanwhile, suggests people out today don’t march, but dance their way along the street in his comment for the Guardian: Can you be arsed? Do you risk being disappointed again? Or do you sit this one out? I mean, climate change is a bit old-hat now, isn’t it? And some people say it doesn’t even exist – people like ... Nigel Lawson. ... The People’s Climate March this Sunday is important. Because governments won’t put the case for action on climate change too strongly – no, that might be interpreted as being “anti-business”. It might dissuade corporations from building factories in countries that sign on to climate agreements. It might be harmful to THE ECONOMY. So once again it will be left to ordinary people to point out the blindingly obvious fact that destroying the place you live in is not a good idea. It really isn’t Finally, The Observer has Desmond Tutu writing for it, who reprises a message about fossil fuel divestment that he’s made powerfully before: As responsible citizens of the world – sisters and brothers of one family, the human family, God’s family – we have a duty to persuade our leaders to lead us in a new direction: to help us abandon our collective addiction to fossil fuels, starting this week in New York at the United Nations Climate Summit. Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a technical scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time. In the UK, the Manchester march gets going in just under an hour at Piccadilly Gardens in the town centre. There are also marches in Edinburgh (1.30pm), Sheffield (from 1pm), in Stroud (12pm) and in Dudley (2pm). More details here. Separate to the main London march, at 2.30pm activists from the group No Dash for Gas / Reclaim the Power will be outside Conservative central office at what they perceive as the party’s problem with climate change denial. In a statement, the group’s Jo Martin said: Climate change is slipping down the agenda at an alarming rate. Today thousands of people are marching across the world and they demand that their voices are heard. By denying climate change, these MPs are denying our children their right to a safe and sustainable future. We need to see decisive action taken on climate from our representatives, rather than repeated denial and ignorance. Emma Thompson, who has recently returned from a trip to the Arctic with Greenpeace, has been talking to Andrew Marr on the BBC. Marr asks what concerns her most about climate change. “I’ll tell you exactly what it was, it’s the water marks left by the glacial mess the sides of the valleys where they were once great... You forget that glaciers retreat but they also lose mass,” she says. Marr asks her what she says to climate sceptics and people who argue the melting of the Arctic will make the world richer as natural resources are opened up. Thompson responds: It’s a very strange position to take because as we note the weather changing, all of the violent storms, the flooding, all of the very clear and concrete data that we now have... the fact the last IPCC report which was thousands of scientists from around the world has said without a shadow of a doubt a) global warming is occurring, b) it’s happening much faster than predicted and c) it’s been caused by human beings and our burning of fossil fuels. The moment for that denial is over. We’ve tipped over that point. What’s interesting is that now that the Arctic ice is melting and we are able to get to places we couldn’t get before and drill before, we’re drilling for the stuff that melted the Arctic ice in the first place...the cycle is speeding up. The Arctic is at it were the canary in the mine. What can people do, Marr asks, to which Thompson says: Go on the march, I’ll be there and speaking. Inform yourself. And understand the fact that although we’re up against huge difficulties - because fossil fuels are a very, very difficult thing to give up. But we now understand that we cannot afford to use them any more, it’s as simple as that, the day for those fuels is over. I want Cameron to very much step back away from coal, because that’s the worst one of the lot. She says David Cameron has “absolutely” abandoned the passion for the green agenda that he showed during his “vote blue, go green” years. Want to find out more about Thompson’s Arctic journey? Watch this great film by our very own Laurence Topham, who accompanied her: This weekend’s events range from huge to modest. Petra Granholm emails from the remote Åland islands in Finland with this photograph of their climate march on Saturday, where she says 80 people turned out. In the background is their local dairy’s biogas plant and a biofuel bus that apparently runs on fish trimmings. Granholm, who is chair of the Åland Society for Nature and the Environmen, says: We believe the solution to the energy crisis does not come in one single package, but in many small alternative solutions. The islands also have a good chance of becoming self.sufficient on wind energy in the near future. Celebs due down at the London march include actor Emma Thompson, musician Peter Gabriel and the comedian Russel Brand, who’s going to be down at Temple Place at 12.30. Here’s Brand on climate change, replete with reels of Fox News churning out climate change denial (read more on Fox News’ climate coverage in this post by our blogger Dana Nuccitelli). Bill McKibben, the US environmentalist and co-founder of 350.org, has been telling New Yorker magazine about the genesis of the marches. Everyone in this movement who heard Ban Ki-moon’s call for world leaders to come to New York City had the same thought: These guys are going to come and do the same thing they always do—offer a few fine speeches and head home having accomplished nothing. We figured we would invite ourselves to come along and try to press them harder than they’ve been pressed before. We don’t expect this will have immediate results here in New York, but we think building a big movement is the only way to get them off the dime. Asked if it’s too late for action, he said: I know how much carbon we can have in the atmosphere, but I don’t know the exact number we need in the streets. It strikes me that the more we have, the better our chances. In New York, march organisers have said they’re expecting more than 100,000 people to turn out today. While I’m sifting through the news coverage of the marches and Tuesday’s UN climate summit, here’s a little photo roundup to give a sense of the breadth of the Australian events. The crowds in Melbourne, Australia, where today’s rolling marches kicked off, were even bigger than the 20,000 that organisers had earlier suggested, according to the Australian Associated Press. The AAP is reporting that around 30,000 people attended the march to call for action on climate change. GetUp! campaigns chief of staff Erin McCallum told the agency: This is a clear testament that Australians want climate action regardless of what Tony Abbott and his government are doing right now. The key message today is we’re doing what he won’t, we’re standing up, we’re taking action as consumers, as citizens, as Australians around the world and all around Australia today. We’re not going to wait for our government to wake up, we’ve woken up and we’re here and we’re going to take action starting right now. Adam Vaughan here, taking over the live blog from Melissa Davey in Australia. Good morning from London, where thousands of people are expected to turn out on the streets today to lobby world leaders to take bold action on climate change. The Guardian’s reporting team will be on the ground in several European cities today, including Arthur Neslen in Brussels and Karl Mathiesen in Paris. In London, where people will be meeting at Temple Place at 12.30pm before marching on parliament, Bibi van der Zee, Damian Carrington and James Randerson will be reporting as events unfold. John Vidal will be reporting from Chester, and I’ll be doing my best to follow other marches around the UK. Meanwhile, here are the other main events on in Europe today (all times local): Amsterdam - 6pm at Kade EYE Paris - 2pm at Place de la République Istanbul - 5pm at DEPO, Tütün Deposu Lüleci Hendek Caddesi No.12 Tophane Berlin - 4pm at the Brandenburg Gate Brussels - 10.30am at Place Poelaer If you’re following along on Twitter, #PeoplesClimate is the ‘official’ tag, but #climatemarch is also worth a look. And if you’re out and about on any of the marches, I’d love to hear from you - please either email me (adam.vaughan@theguardian.com) or tweet me @adamvaughan_uk). Thanks for reading the Australian coverage of the People’s Climate March. We’ll be handing over to our colleagues in the UK and US, so keep following this blog for updates as those events begin to unfold shortly. Tens of thousands of people have attended climate change rallies across Australia, in the first leg of a global wave of protests calling for tougher action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the UN climate summit in New York next week — Oliver Milman reports. The flagship Australian event in Melbourne attracted almost 20,000 people, organisers say. Greens leader Christine Milne told attendees at the Melbourne event that the world is on a trajectory towards an an “unliveable planet”. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, will not be joining more than 120 world leaders at the UN climate summit on Monday. People’s Climate march events are set to take place throughout the UK and US over the coming hours. Watch this live blog for updates as those marches unfold. Around 200 people rallied for action on climate change in Darwin. It seems human signs are popular among climate activists. It’s a sea of umbrellas at the march in Perth. Around 4,000 people formed a human sign spelling out the message ‘Beyond Coal and Gas’ in Sydney this morning. The community group Our Land, Water, Future organised the event and captured the result using a drone. Here’s what the People’s Climate March looked like in Delhi: In a few hours, campaigners will march through central London as part of the global action there. They will be joined by celebrities including actress Emma Thompson and musician Peter Gabriel, and church bells will ring to mark the march through Westminster to parliament, where speeches and a rally will be held. Thompson said: There is little time left to prevent the worst excesses of climate change, yet our world leaders continue to stall. I’ve witnessed the impact climate change is already having on the melting Arctic and on poverty-stricken communities in the developing world. We can’t go on pretending nothing’s happening. I’ll be at the march, and I hope I see you all there. An editorial in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says the public will be watching more closely than ever when world leaders meet in New York on Monday for the UN’s emergency Climate Change Summit. [Australian prime minister Tony Abbott will not be attending] The global People’s Climate March is aimed at gathering momentum and political will in anticipation of the New York summit, and also ahead of UN talks on a binding climate protocol next year, the Post-Gazette says. Climate activists have a lot to be agitated about. The United States has yet to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, developed in 1997, which would have committed this nation to binding reductions in carbon emissions. President Barack Obama announced ahead of the climate summit that he has negotiated voluntary agreements with companies to reduce their emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent pollutant. Voluntary reductions are desirable, but they will not cut emissions deeply enough to avert the effects of climate disruption. Only binding regulations can do that. Read the full piece here. The Perth People’s Climate March is set to begin, with organisers hoping cold and wet weather won’t keep too many people away. Many people are reporting they didn’t know about the People’s Climate March events being held around Australia until today. Some said because the event seems to have been publicised largely online through social media, people not engaged with those mediums missed out. From our live blog commenters: The People’s Climate March in Canberra had more of a festival atmosphere, with musicians playing on the lawns of the Australian National University where the main event was held. On-site climate workshops were held on topics like divestment of shares in fossil fuels. Bill Ryan, a 92-year-old grandfather and WWII Kokoda veteran, addressed the crowd. He has long protested against Whitehaven Coal’s Maules Creek mine in north-west NSW. There were also giant turtles. Meanwhile in Adelaide, people met in Rundle Park before marching through the streets. Speakers at that event included Patrick Greene, who has worked in the solar energy industry for several years. He said the government was jeopardising renewable energy jobs. For myself and 13,000 other solar workers around Australia, this industry is our livelihood. We go to work each morning knowing we’re doing something to make the climate a little bit safer for our kids. With this government in power, our entire industry is at risk with this review of the renewable energy target. Thousands of people attended the People’s Climate March in Brisbane, Fairfax reports. Kirsty Albion from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition told the Brisbane Times: It’s my generation’s future on the line, that’s why we’re here in Brisbane calling on our leaders to protect our future, by moving Australia beyond coal and gas and investing in renewable energy. Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne, Rob Moodie, has told attendees at the People’s Climate March in Melbourne that food shortages and outbreaks of disease will increase if governments don’t act to cut carbon emissions. The impact of climate change will be universal and can’t be limited by quarantine. It will be unpredictable and if we leave it too late, we won’t be able to adapt. We won’t be able to rely on miraculous cures or a simple vaccine. Act now or pay later. We all know prevention is better than cure. Responding to climate change is the ultimate test of prevention. Effective climate control is good health. Remember there are three tiers of prevention. The first is the system. The second is the system. And the third is the system. Our politicians must act to confront the biggest public health challenge of the 21st century. In Bendigo, people are campaigning for global climate action by holding a picnic. Guardian Australia reporter Nick Evershed has stumbled across the People’s Climate March unfolding in Glebe. The police [push]bike squad in Cairns are keeping an eye on climate marchers. Back to the People’s Climate March unfolding in Melbourne. Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman is on the ground and tweeting updates here. Ben and Jerry’s — undeterred by calls from Queensland environment minister Andrew Powell to boycott the ice-cream company because he claims their calls to protect the reef had jeopardised jobs and tourism dollars — turned up at Melbourne’s rally. Jeremy Lawrence, a mechanical engineer, told reporter Oliver Milman he was attending the Melbourne event as an “economic rationalist libertarian”. Lawrence says: If you talk to a lot of conservative engineers, the older ones who plan the grid, they can say it’s not going to stay like it is now for the next 50 years. They say other countries around the world will leapfrog us, with countries like India and Africa set to leapfrog us in their renewable energy efforts. Meanwhile, deputy Greens leader Adam Bandt posed for a photo with marchers. Here are some comments from Guardian readers watching our live coverage of the People’s Climate March. Keep your thoughts coming. Meanwhile, here’s a lovely picture from the climate march on the Sunshine Coast — Gubbi Gubbi Dancers on the beach, courtesy of Reece Proudfoot. In around 12 hours time, people will take to the streets in New York for the People’s Climate March event there, with Leonardo DiCaprio, former US vice president Al Gore, UN secretary general Ban ki-moon and mayor Bill de Blasio set to take part. Organisers predict as many as 100,000 people will march through midtown Manhattan, which would make it the biggest climate rally in history. But the Wire reports that many businesses are unprepared for the mass march and had no idea it was happening until informed by journalists. Two ‘Climate Trains’ that have traveled from California to New York will make stops along the way to pick up marchers in Denver, Chicago, Reno and Omaha, the Wire reports. The event will feature giant movable art installations, a 300-foot-long banner that reads ‘Capitalism = Climate Chaos – Flood Wall Street’, and a large recreation of Noah’s ark. World leaders will meet for the UN’s emergency Climate Change Summit in New York on Monday. Australian prime minister Tony Abbott will not be attending. Here are pictures from People’s Climate March events happening around the world as people spring to action across different time zones. Jakarta Los Angeles Sydney Melbourne Kiribati Professor Tim Flannery, head of the Climate Council, motivated the Melbourne crowd, telling them they were creating positive change. He said the time for questioning the science on climate change was over. I want to remind you of what’s at stake here. This is an issue where the science is very, very clear. We know that burning fossil fuels in this country adds about $2.6bn to our health bill every year. We know that hundreds of people die from the very tiny particles that are emitted when burning fossil fuels. We know that we can do things better. Australia was leading the world in terms of solar power, he said, with 1.3m solar installations compared to half a million in the US. People want change, and we need to send a very strong message to the world that Australia does care about this and we want better action from our government. This is not a time for despairing. This is a time for determined, resolute action. I can tell you if we don’t take action this year, next year, and the year after, it may be too late. The stage has been crashed at the Melbourne rally, Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman says. Police tell him there are “easily” more than 10,000 people gathered, though numbers aren’t final. Greens leader Christine Milne told attendees at the People’s Climate March in Melbourne that the key message of the day was “action not words”. We don’t need to start a conversation, we need to take action. We want no more delays. Climate change is real, it is accelerating, we are on a trajectory for four degrees of warming which is an unliveable planet and we won’t stand for it. That is what we have to convey to Tony Abbott and leaders around the world. Australia should be net carbon zero by 2050, Milne said, and called for greater investment in renewable energy. The reign of fossil fuels is over. What we now have to do is end the reign of the fossil fools who keep it going. A strong crowd has gathered for the People’s Climate March at the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne. Victoria Marshall-Cerins and her daughter Anna told reporter Oliver Milman that they believe climate change is one of the biggest issues facing Australia. Marshall-Cerins says: We’re here because of the fact that Australia is now dragging its heels –we’ve gone from being one of the world leaders on climate change to going backwards. The ‘town-crier’ is getting in on the action too. An organiser of the march said people appeared to be more energised than at a similar rally held last November which attracted 40,000 people, but wasn’t sure that quite so many people had turned out for Sunday’s event. Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman is at a press conference being held by Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler ahead of the start of the Melbourne climate march. Butler criticised Australian prime minister Tony Abbott for refusing to join world leaders on Monday at the United Nations conference in New York, Milman reports. However, Butler would not commit Labor to a post-2020 emissions cut target. Butler told reporters: Both major parties had strong commitments to carbon pollution reduction based on a range of conditions. It’s not clear whether those conditions have been satisfied. We haven’t got a position [on post-2020] yet. That’s the serious work Australia should be doing now but instead the Abbott government is busy dismantling the good work we’ve done to date. People are already gathering in Cairns – this photograph is courtesy of Andrew Picone. And Sarah Berry has shared this picture taken at sunrise on the Sunshine Coast. That event kicked off at 5am today and will run through to sunset. Those attending will walk the length of the coast starting at Sunshine beach in the north and finishing at Kings beach in the south at sunset. Daniel Rockett, from conservation group WWF Australia, told Guardian Australia that climate change is set to make natural disasters more severe and costly in the coastal zone of south-east Queensland. Some people are going to great heights to get the climate action message out there. Online activist group GetUp! has posted this picture on Twitter of a banner strung up on the Three Sisters rock formation in the Blue Mountains of NSW. Here are the People’s Climate March events happening around Australia today. Melbourne from 11am - State Library of Victoria Sydney from 12pm - Bicentennial Park, Glebe Canberra from 10:30am - Chifley Meadows, ANU Adelaide from 11am - Rundle Park Brisbane from 11am - Queen’s Park Perth from 1pm - Russell Square Park Darwin from 10am - Nightcliff Foreshore To follow the events on Twiiter, you can use the hashtag: #peoplesclimate You can also tweet your pics to me @MelissaLDavey and you can follow reporter Oliver Milman who is covering the Melbourne event. The Adelaide event took place yesterday – here’s a pic of that march from 350.org founder and environmentalist Bill McKibben: And there are media reports that security is tight in Cairns, with parts of the city in lockdown and an extra 800 police officers, who have additional powers, patrolling the streets in preparation for the march there. The second and final day of the G20 finance meeting kicks off in Queensland’s tropical north on Sunday. Supporters of the People’s Climate March are expected to gather in the Cairns CBD on Sunday morning before making their way to the local convention centre where the meeting is being held. The flagship Australian People’s Climate March is set to begin in Melbourne at 11am. Guardian Australia reporter Oliver Milman will be on the ground covering it for us. Speakers will include environmentalist Professor Tim Flannery, Greens party leader Senator Christine Milne and Labor environment spokesman Mark Butler. Looks like Milne is raring to go: Similar events were held around the country in November last year for a National Day of Climate Action, with organisers GetUp saying 60,000 people participated in rallies, across capital cities and regional towns. But Sunday’s action is expected to be the biggest yet. Good morning and welcome to live blog coverage of the biggest global march for action on climate change in history – the ‘People’s Climate March’. Events are happening all over the world and we’ll bring you coverage of as many of them as we can, with our reporters covering events in Australia, London and New York. The action comes as world leaders prepare to meet for the UN’s emergency Climate Change Summit in New York on Monday. US president Barack Obama, UK prime minister David Cameron, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon and 125 heads of state will attend that summit — but Australian prime minister Tony Abbott will not be there despite heading to a UN Security Council meeting in New York the next day. Abbott attracted criticism on social media following the news. You can read this piece from the Guardian on 20 high-profile personalities attending the People’s Climate March and their reasons for taking part. Ban says: Action on climate change is urgent. The more we delay, the more we will pay in lives and in money. I will link arms with those marching for climate action. We stand with them on the right side of this key issue for our common future. Event organisers hope to kick-start public action in the lead-up to the Paris climate talks in December 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2012/jun/02/george-osborne-cuts-windfarm-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-02T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"George Osborne demands massive cuts to windfarm subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/02/george-osborne-cuts-windfarm-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2012/jun/02/george-osborne-cuts-windfarm-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne demands massive cuts to windfarm subsidies","bodyText":"Plans for dramatic cuts in government subsidies for onshore windfarms are being drawn up by the Treasury in a move that seriously undermines David Cameron's claim to be running \"the greenest government ever\". The Observer has learned that George Osborne is demanding cuts of 25% in subsidies, a reduction the industry says would \"kill dead\" the development of wind power sites. The Treasury's stance has put the chancellor at loggerheads with the Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey, whose party strongly supports more renewable energy. Osborne, whose reputation has taken a dive following his widely criticised budget and a subsequent string of U-turns, has been under heavy pressure from Tory MPs to reduce the billions spent on green commitments. In February more than 100 Conservative backbenchers wrote to the prime minister demanding cuts to the £400m a year public subsidies for windfarms which they see as evidence of too much Lib Dem influence over coalition policy. A prominent opponent of onshore wind power is the Duke of Edinburgh, who is said to have described turbines as useless and to believe they will never work. Tim Yeo, Tory chairman of the all-party energy and climate change select committee, said the Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), which is headed by Davey, were following different agendas. \"This is an example of where Decc's attempts to stimulate renewable energy are being hampered by Treasury intervention,\" he said. \"The way to deal with this – and realise the savings the Treasury wants to achieve – is to have more onshore renewable energy, which requires lower levels of subsidy, and less offshore, which requires more. We need to change the balance.\" Critics accuse the chancellor of pandering to Conservative backbenchers who do not want turbines built in their constituencies, believing they will damage their prospects of re-election. They argue the cuts make no economic sense, because alternatives, such as siting the turbines in the sea, would be much more expensive. \"This is a reckless act of political opportunism by a chancellor keen to boost his popularity among his backbench MPs,\" said Juliet Davenport, chief executive of renewable electricity supplier Good Energy. However, Chris Heaton-Harris, a Tory MP who led the backbench campaign for cuts, said he was greatly encouraged. \"I want to see a dramatic cut,\" he said, arguing that onshore wind power was expensive compared with gas and that it would drive up fuel poverty. However, proponents of wind power point to rocketing gas prices and the air pollution and climate change benefits of renewable energy technologies, of which onshore wind is the cheapest. \"It is crackers to kill dead the deployment of the cheapest renewable technology if you genuinely are worried about the cost,\" said Gordon Edge, policy director at industry group RenewableUK. A source at one of Britain's big six energy companies said: \"It's perverse – you get less renewable energy bang for your buck. It only makes sense if you don't like windfarms in your constituency.\" After becoming party leader in 2005, Cameron adopted the slogan \"vote blue, go green\" as he made the environment the centrepiece of his drive to modernise the Conservatives. Shortly after entering a coalition with the Lib Dems he promised to lead the \"greenest government ever\", adding that \"nowhere are long-term decisions more needed than actually in the fields of energy and climate change and environment\". But Osborne has made clear that he does not believe the green agenda can remain a priority when cash is short and the deficit needs to be reduced. With his own political fortunes on the slide, Tory MPs believe he can be persuaded to back their anti-green campaigns. This year the government angered green campaigners by announcing plans to slash subsidies for solar energy, a move the industry roundly condemned. There are more than 3,000 wind turbines in the UK countryside and the debate has become more polarised in the past two years, with a tripling of local opposition. However, a large majority of the public remains in favour of wind power, even if it is placed within a few miles of their home. The Treasury declined to comment, but a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which runs the subsidy scheme, said: \"It is vital that our support for renewable electricity both encourages investment and represents value for money for consumers. The government will publish the new support levels shortly.\" According to sources, the decision has been delayed by the Treasury \"crawling all over\" the new rates put forward by Davey. Decc's initial proposal in October, delayed by wrangling, was for a 10% cut in the support for onshore wind under a scheme called the \"renewables obligation\". But the Observer was told the Treasury has demanded a 25% cut. \"The delay means the whole of the UK's renewables investment portfolio is being jeopardised by Osborne's pandering to Tory backbenchers,\" said a source. \"It is total prioritisation of politics over the economic interests of the country.\" Davenport said: \"The 10% proposal was the product of independently commissioned analysis by Decc. If the Treasury swoops in at the last minute and shortcuts that process, the credibility of the government's renewables policy will be in tatters, along with the prime minister's claim to be the greenest government ever. Of course, some might argue that is precisely what the chancellor wants to achieve.\" The setting of subsidy levels is a negotiation between industry and government, according to Michael Liebrich, chief executive of analysts Bloomberg New Energy Finance, who made an influential presentation to David Cameron and the world's leading energy ministers in May. \"If you cut too fast, you damage the industry and the supply chain, but if you go too slow, you create subsidy junkies,\" he said. Liebrich's presentation showed the global average cost of onshore wind was falling, but he said using that to justify cuts in the UK was wrong: \"Just because the best windfarms in the world are competitive [with gas] does not mean the average ones are yet.\" He added that large scales, fast planning and good grid connections made US windfarms much cheaper than those in the UK. There are 320 onshore windfarms in UK, a third of them in England. Many more are awaiting construction or planning permission."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/sustainable-business-promising-new-year","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-03T12:26:00Z","webTitle":"The new year looks promising for sustainable business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-business-promising-new-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-business-promising-new-year","fields":{"headline":"The new year looks promising for sustainable business","bodyText":"So, 2012, what's it to be? Can we find a glass half full of something vaguely cheering, or are we staring at the dregs in the new year? What hope for sustainable business when we have economies in atrophy across the world, a damp squib of a climate deal in Durban – and David Cameron's drive to lead the 'greenest government ever' looking at least two huskies short of a sledge? Let's get the grim stuff over with. Inevitably, tight purse strings mean less money – whether bank loans, business investment or state funding – for all sorts of sustainability initiatives. And a divided government will hardly risk inflaming the Tory backbenchers on whose support it depends by making bold gestures on climate, say, or energy. So where's the good news for 2012? First, despite numerous gloomy predictions, there is precious little sign that mainstream business is going soft on sustainable development. If it really were just an optional add-on, a luxury for the good times, then the streets should be filled with newly redundant sustainablity managers. In practice, I know of just one who has lost their job in the past year. And as Forum for the Future's Sally Uren points out, such roles are rising up the responsibilities ladder. So it's goodbye sustainability manager, hello chief sustainability officer. Meanwhile, the contrast between the way in which sustainability leaders – companies like Kingfisher, Unilever and Marks &amp; Spencer – are sticking to their course, while the government under chief petty officer Osborne is noisily trimming its sails, couldn't be more striking. Unlike politicians, business leaders realise they're in it for the long term. Second, while cuts may indeed stymie investment, price signals send out a more nuanced message. The same rising costs of oil and resources which dampen the economy also put a premium on energy efficiency. And there's nothing like soaring energy bills to focus the mind on low-carbon alternatives. So it's just as well that the cost of solar energy will keep falling, with some experts suggesting grid parity is just a few years away. In hindsight, this could make the dip caused by the government's shock move on feed-in tarriffs look like a very small blip indeed. Third, tough times can be good for new business models. David Bent, deputy director of sustainable business at Forum for the Future, points to the surge in peer-to-peer startups – many of which, from AirBnB to WhipCar, are inherently sustainable (maximising the use of idle resources). Expect this to be a surefire growth sector in 2012. Some established companies, too, are exploring new consumption models. Patagonia even went so far as to exhort its customers not to buy stuff they don't need. While Unilever's CEO Paul Polman has spoken out against \"mindless consumption\", arguing that \"we have a unique opportunity to reinvent [it], to bring about 'mindful' consumption.\" So, there are three reasons to be at least moderately cheerful.

The number of new wind turbines built this year is down by half on last year. To date, 540MW worth of new turbines, on land and offshore, have been built this year – 200 onshore and 50 offshore turbines. Across the UK last year, 1,192MW of wind capacity was added. The pipeline of new projects has also stagnated – this year, 2,058MW of windfarms were submitted for planning permission, compared with 2,080MW in 2010, and the number approved dropped markedly, from 1,366MW in 2010 to 920MW, according to figures from industry body RenewableUK. This contrasts with the 30GW of new gas-fired power stations that are at planning stage. These will require tens of billions of pounds of investment, coming mostly from the big six energy suppliers. Although gas is cheaper than renewables at present, the cost of renewables is steadily coming down, and over-reliance on gas is one of the key factors behind high energy bills, according to the government. About 60% of rises in the past year have been the result of the higher cost of fuel imports. In 2010, the total investment in renewable energy in the UK fell dramatically, from $11bn (£7bn) to less than $3bn – a drop of about 70%, according to Roland Berger, the consultancy. This year, the investment has recovered somewhat, after about $6bn was invested in offshore wind, but this is still well down on 2009 figures – despite the government's pledges to expand the renewable energy sector, with a target of 18GW of generating capacity to come from offshore wind by 2020. At least £200bn will be needed this decade to transform the UK's energy sector to a low-carbon footing, but there is little sign yet of investment on that scale. Last week construction group Carillion said 4,500 jobs are at risk as a result of a government decision to cut solar energy subsidies. There are 39,000 jobs dependent on the solar energy sector and thousands more are also at risk. Manfred Hader, a partner at Roland Berger, said: \"More regulatory clarity and the making available of large amounts of capital are necessary to drive government targets for offshore wind. There will be a need to bridge the gap between funding via traditional sources such as utilities and banks and the total investment required – it is a moot point as to whether institutional investors would be interested and whether the green investment bank would make a real difference to this issue.\" Wind represents the biggest share of the UK's renewable energy mix, but other forms of renewable energy have also been set back. Solar power companies are set to cut thousands of jobs, as the government abruptly halved the subsidies available for solar panels. The biomass sector has suffered, too, as several proposed new biomass power stations, burning waste, energy crops or straw, have been delayed. Drax, which operates the biggest UK coal-fired power station, has put on hold plans for two new straw-burning biomass plants. While renewables struggle, gas has seen a flurry of interest from the big six suppliers. Over the past few years, plans for at least 30GW of gas-fired power have been brought forward, which would lead to a rash of new power stations across the country, with some now in construction but most still in the planning stages. Gas businesses have also been lobbying heavily to be seen as a \"green\" fuel, because burning gas produces about half the carbon dioxide of burning coal. However, gas lobbyists also have the renewables industry in their sights, as the Guardian has revealed, with behind-the-scenes meetings with key political figures across Europe and the publication of a report which took McKinsey research showing renewables could power a low-carbon Europe and re-interpreted it as an argument that opting for gas would be cheaper than pushing renewable energy. Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, invited the construction of new gas-fired power stations with a promise that a new \"emissions performance standard\" would be set at a rate that favoured gas but blocked new coal-fired power. He promised this new regulation would not be reviewed until 2015, and any revision would not be retroactive, giving gas companies a clear window for investment. Huhne's comments made clear one of the reasons behind the government's encouragement of new gas-fired power – that new gas power stations take only about 18 months to build. Ministers are concerned that as many of the older coal-fired power stations are taken out of service in the next few years, there could be an \"energy gap\" between demand for electricity and supply. As putting up new gas-fired power stations is quick compared with wind turbines or nuclear reactors, gas is now the favoured option if ministers fear there is any likelihood of suppliers failing to \"keep the lights on\". Burning gas produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal so switching from coal to gas has helped the UK to one of the most impressive emissions-cutting records of any country over the past 20 years. There were no gas-fired power stations in 1990, but the rapid expansion of the sector driven by the Conservative government, under Margaret Thatcher, was the biggest single factor behind the 25% cut in the UK's greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2010. The government's new carbon plan - published on December 1 - showed a further switch away from the UK's remaining coal-fired power stations, many of which will be taken out of service in the next few years, is a major factor in enabling the government to promised 34% emissions cuts compared with 1990 levels by 2022. Between 40 and 70GW of new capacity will be needed to meet the UK's carbon targets. Huhne said: \"The energy mix will depend on what happens in the world gas markets. If there is a low gas price in the UK, then you will see more gas and carbon capture and storage and less renewable energy and nuclear [power].\" There are risks to a dependence on gas, however. High prices in world markets have been the main cause of energy bill rises and as demand increases this is likely to continue. Huhne has said the UK needs to give up its \"addiction to fossil fuels\" but on current plans gas looks a clear winner from government energy policies, with the outlook for renewables less certain. David Nickols, managing director at the consultancy WSP Future Energy said project finance for major renewables projects looked difficult, and planning restrictions were also \"major obstacle\". Paul Sloman, a partner at Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, warned: \"The UK cannot afford to be reliant mainly on gas-fired generation as energy security is also a very pertinent issue and increasing reliance on gas is not the solution, particularly as the UK's own gas production from the North Sea declines.\" • This article was amended on 6 December to change the number of turbines in the second paragraph from 400 to 250."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/24/alf-adams-laser-research-universities","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-24T17:14:19Z","webTitle":"Hidden geniuses: science researchers who don't get enough credit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/24/alf-adams-laser-research-universities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/24/alf-adams-laser-research-universities","fields":{"headline":"Hidden geniuses: science researchers who don't get enough credit","bodyText":"Professor Alf Adams should be a billionaire. And, if not famous as such, at least acknowledged by more than an academic niche for his work, a collective nod of the head for a genuinely inspired breakthrough. Adams essentially made the digital world we live in possible. His discovery is the \"strained quantum well laser\" – or the lasers that power the internet, CDs, DVDs, computer mice and supermarket checkouts, to name but a few. His idea was a radical one. All the semiconductor laser research of the time focused on achieving a perfectly matched crystal lattice to make a high quality laser. In a quantum well laser there is an extremely thin layer of semiconducting crystals in which the laser light is generated. Adams's eureka moment – which came to him while he was walking on a beach at Bournemouth in 1986 – was that if the crystal lattice of this layer was grown in a way that put it deliberately under strain, it could be \"squashed\" into a certain shape, producing a more controlled, concentrated beam of light while making more efficient use of electricity. The result, tested out in practice in the labs at the University of Surrey, is much higher data capacity using less electrical energy. Adams's idea of actively putting lasers under strain was met by scepticism from other researchers because it flew against the conventional wisdom of the time. So when he went out to British firms to tell them about the potential for the increased power and performance of strained layer lasers, no one wanted to take the risk of backing the idea. Adams found support overseas, gaining interest from the electronics firm Philips in Eindhoven. The R&amp;D team there were immediately stunned by the difference in performance generated by Adams's approach. CD players were suddenly viable for a mass market, much smaller and cheaper, and the larger data capacity meant fast-processing of images, leading eventually to the development of DVDs and Blu-Ray. It's fair to say that the majority of all lasers being used around the world are now Alf's invention. They are everywhere, billions of them, around five in every home it is estimated. I was fortunate to study for my PhD under Adams, working with him on strained-layer lasers during the 1990s to prove how much more effective the technology could be. My impression was of an extremely clever man, particularly in his ability to think around problems, to sit and stare and come up with something no one had ever considered before. He's still active and in and out of the department, and that ability to use lateral thought to cut through conventional thinking is still clearly evident. Apart from the science, Adams was mainly interested in how his ideas could be applied and to develop something useful. His story is just one example of how work by universities on groundbreaking practical elements of technology can be taken for granted. Adams was quite deservedly made a Fellow of the Royal Society and worthy of wider recognition. Many people might despair at the thought of a lost fortune, but he's well-known internationally within his field, had a brilliant and enjoyable career, and that's been immensely satisfying for him. The work begun by Adams has plenty more potential. At the Advanced Technology Institute we are now looking to find even faster and more efficient lasers. The biggest challenge is dealing with the consequences of the sheer success of Adams's work. The internet consumes more than 1% of the world's total energy, which is vast in itself, but the rise in demand for internet services is exponential. The next generations of strained-layer laser technology are already becoming available, which will significantly reduce energy consumption and the environmental impact of the internet, meaning more work in a UK university lab which should make life better for everyone. There's also work on strained layers for low-energy lighting, portable environmental pollution monitoring sensors, and for beaming solar energy from space back to Earth. Now of course, the commercial partners are already on-board. Stephen Sweeney is professor of physics, head of photonics and EPSRC leadership fellow at the University of Surrey.

The group Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the Kochs, said on Wednesday it was spending $2.4m on television ads accusing Obama of putting billions of taxpayer dollars at risk to help political donors. \"The American people have absolutely had enough. They are sick of being put on the hook for expensive and wasteful loans to President Obama's so-called green energy pet projects,\" said Tim Phillips, a longtime lobbyist who now heads Americans for Prosperity. The same group helped organise the Tea Party protests against Obama in 2009. It has said the ads will run for two weeks on stations in Florida, Michigan, Virginia, and New Mexico. All are battleground states in the 2012 presidential election. As far as political spending goes, $2.4m is relatively modest for the Kochs. Their network of oil refineries and ownership of consumer brands such as Lycra has made them among the richest men in America. In the last few years the brothers have spent more than $50m to advance their political agenda, supporting foundations such as Americans for Prosperity, which opposes pollution controls and has worked to discredit the science on climate change. The Kochs spent nearly $7m to fund Americans for Prosperity in 2007, according to tax records. The group reported income of $22m last year, from anonymous donors. The Kochs are reportedly gearing up to spend another $200m in the 2012 elections. But the ad buy on Solyndra, the solar panel company which went bankrupt after receiving $535m in federal government loan guarantees, is the biggest foray into the 2012 elections to date for Americans for Prosperity. The amount already exceeds the $1.3m the group spent on ads in the 2010 elections. Americans for Prosperity said this should be seen as an indicator of its strategy for 2012. The ad opens with shots of a fake newspaper front page, called the Solyndra News, while a voiceover accuses Obama of giving favours to wealthy donors. It goes on to question the entire clean-energy loan programme at the department of energy – a programme that was in fact put in place under George Bush. \"Risking billions of taxpayer dollars to help his political donors. Is this the change we are supposed to believe in?\" the voiceover asks. The White House has rejected charges, led by Republicans, that politics influenced decisions on the loan guarantee for Solyndra."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-29T14:40:05Z","webTitle":"What was the little ice age?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age","fields":{"headline":"What was the little ice age?","bodyText":"The \"little ice age\", evidence of which was first recorded around 1300, and which extended through to the mid 1800s, was the coldest interval over the Northern Hemisphere for one thousand or so years. Periodic plagues and famines ravaged Europe and glaciers descended from the Alps to engulf a number of villages. One influence may have been a drop in solar energy. Isotopes of carbon in tree rings and beryllium in ice cores show a drop-off in solar radiation during much of the period. Moreover, sunspot observations that began around 1610 show a near-absence of reported sunspots between 1645 and 1715. However, recent studies have brought down the relative importance of this solar effect on the little ice age. Also in the mix are volcanoes, which seem to have erupted more frequently after 1500 than during the so-called medieval warm period that preceded it. The 1815 eruption of Indonesia's Tambora – one of the most violent ever recorded on Earth – led to a disastrously cold summer across much of the globe in 1816. That \"year without a summer\" brought crop failures to northern Europe as well as snows in Vermont as late as early June. Like the medieval warm period, the little ice age appears to have been strongest over the Northern Hemisphere's continents, although it's hard to completely eliminate geographic bias from these early records – and there's little evidence from the tropics and southern hemisphere to say what actually happened there. Some researchers argue that both phenomena were primarily regional events, as opposed to the global-scale warming under way now.

Gallons of water soon spilled from a pump, saturating the soil by his feet. Behind him stood row upon row of curved mirrors held aloft on metal cradles, each directed towards the fierce sun overhead. As the sun's rays hit the mirrors, they were reflected towards a thin glass pipe containing water. The now super-heated water turned to steam, resulting in enough pressure to drive the pumps used to irrigate the surrounding fields where Egypt's lucrative cotton crop was grown. It was an invention, claimed Shuman, which could help Egypt become far less reliant on the coal being imported at great expense from Britain's mines. \"The human race must finally utilise direct sun power or revert to barbarism,\" wrote Shuman in a letter to Scientific American magazine the following year. But the outbreak of the first world war just a few months later abruptly ended his dream and his solar troughs were soon broken up for scrap, with the metal being used for the war effort. Barbarism, it seemed, had prevailed. Almost a century later, a convoy of air-conditioned coaches sweeps through the affluent suburb of Maadi – where Shuman had demonstrated his fledgling solar panels – continuing south for 90km towards Kuraymat, an area of flat, uninhabited desert near the city of Beni Suef. The high-level international delegation of CEOs, politicians, financiers and scientists has come to visit a brand new \"hybrid\" power station that uses both natural gas and solar panels to generate electricity. Before the coaches reach the facility's security gates, its 6,000 parabolic troughs – each six metres tall with a combined surface area of 130,000sq metres – are already visible from the perimeter road. Even though the panels account for just one seventh of the power plant's 150MW generating capacity, the Egyptian government, which has been pushing to develop the site since 1997, hopes to prove to the delegation that it is the desert sun – not fossil fuels, such as gas, coal and oil – that should be used not only to generate far more of the electricity across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena), but, crucially, for neighbouring Europe, too. Gerhard Knies, a German particle physicist, was the first person to estimate how much solar energy was required to meet humanity's demand for electricity. In 1986, in direct response to the Chernobyl nuclear accident, he scribbled down some figures and arrived at the following remarkable conclusion: in just six hours, the world's deserts receive more energy from the sun than humans consume in a year. If even a tiny fraction of this energy could be harnessed – an area of Saharan desert the size of Wales could, in theory, power the whole of Europe – Knies believed we could move beyond dirty and dangerous fuels for ever. Echoing Schuman's own frustrations, Knies later asked whether \"we are really, as a species, so stupid\" not to make better use of this resource. Over the next two decades, he worked – often alone – to drive this idea into public consciousness. The culmination of his efforts is \"Desertec\", a largely German-led initiative that aims to provide 15% of Europe's electricity by 2050 through a vast network of solar and wind farms stretching right across the Mena region and connecting to continental Europe via special high voltage, direct current transmission cables, which lose only around 3% of the electricity they carry per 1,000km. The tentative total cost of building the project has been estimated at €400bn (£342bn). Until now, Desertec has been seen by many observers as little more than a mirage in the sand; the fanciful plan of well-meaning dreamers. After all, the technical, political, security and financial hurdles can, each on their own, appear to be utterly insurmountable. But over the past two years, the initiative has received significant support from some of the biggest corporate names in Germany, a country that already leads Europe when it comes to adopting and developing renewable energy, particularly solar. In the autumn of 2009, an \"international\" consortium of companies formed the Desertec Industrial Initiative (Dii) with weighty companies, such as E.ON, Munich Re, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, all signing up as \"shareholders\". Germany's announcement earlier this year that, in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it was to speed up its total phase-out of nuclear power suddenly pulled the Desertec idea into much sharper focus. Coupled with faltering international negotiations and increasingly dire warnings on climate change – just last month the International Energy Agency warned that the world is headed for irreversible climate change if it doesn't start reducing carbon emissions within five years – it would seem the time is now right for an idea of such scale and ambition. Last month, at its annual conference in Cairo, Dii confirmed to the world that the first phase of the Desertec plan is set to begin in Morocco next year with the construction of a 500MW solar farm near to the desert city of Ouarzazate. The 12sq km project would act as a \"reference project\" that, much like Egypt's own project at Kuraymat, would help convince both investors and politicians that similar farms could be repeated across the Mena region in the coming years and decades. \"It's all systems go in Morocco,\" announced Paul van Son, Dii's CEO, to the visiting delegates. Talks, he added, were – given their shared close proximity, along with Morocco, to western Europe's grid – already under way with Tunisia and Algeria about joining the \"first phase\" of Desertec. Countries such as Egypt, Syria, Libya and Saudi Arabia would be expected to join in the \"scale-up\" phase from 2020 onwards, once extra transmission cables were laid across the Mediterranean and via Turkey, with the whole venture becoming financially self-sustaining by 2035. Van Son swats away any talk that the Desertec project is built on a precarious foundation of presumption, naivety and hope. \"Yes, the current global financial crisis has clearly not been very helpful, but everyone also realises that being dependent on fossil fuels creates vulnerability,\" he says. He also rejects any notion that Desertec carries with it even a whiff of neo-colonialism. Earlier this year such sentiments were raised by Daniel Ayuk Mbi Egbe of the African Network for Solar Energy. \"Many Africans are sceptical [about Desertec],\" he said. \"[Europeans] make promises, but at the end of the day, they bring their engineers, they bring their equipment, and they go. It's a new form of resource exploitation, just like in the past.\" Other Mena-based speakers made similar points, not least that any electricity generated will first be desperately needed by local populations as they fight poverty. \"When the idea for Desertec was first announced there was anger and irritation from the Arab League,\" admits Van Son. \"They didn't understand it at first, but we explained that it would benefit their members, too. We explained it would be a cooperative process and they became more relaxed. It's a win-win for all, we stressed. The relationship is all positive now.\" Desertec should also be supported, argue its champions, because it will improve energy security by helping to diversify supply. At present, says Van Son, Europeans are vulnerable to the so-called \"energy weapon\", namely, when an energy-rich country holds its neighbours to ransom by restricting or denying supply. Think Russia and its gas, he says. Or a terrorist attack on an oil pipeline. Desertec will help to dilute these threats. He is bemused, though, that the current domination of Dii by German companies should rouse suspicion. (There was not a single political or corporate representative from the UK at the conference, yet at least half hailed from Germany.) \"Yes, the initiative came from Germany. But there are 15 different nationalities involved, including companies such as HSBC and Morgan Stanley. This is just the start.\" A common question at the conference is: \"Who is going to pay for Desertec?\" There is talk of loans from development institutions such as the World Bank (the route being taken by Morocco). The presence of German banks suggests they are considering being key lenders, too. But there is also the implication that much of the burden will fall on the European taxpayer, either through EU subsidies, or tariffs added to their energy bills. Angelika Niebler, a Christian Democrat MEP from Germany, travelled to Cairo as a member of the European parliament's energy committee. She says it is \"too early\" to talk about EU financing but adds: \"Energy is going to be a bigger priority for the EU in coming years than agriculture has been in the past and Desertec will surely feature.\" Hans Josef-Fell, a representative of Germany's Green party, is also in Cairo for the conference. \"There is a fear in Germany that paying for green electricity direct from North Africa will be too heavy a burden on our consumers,\" he says. Germany already has among the highest electricity prices in Europe, in part because of a huge wave of renewable energy installations across the country. Europe, particularly Germany, seems to increasingly know what it wants from Desertec. But what of its Mena partners? Obaïd Amrane, a board member of the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy, the government body responsible for overseeing Desertec's first plant, says his country has its own plans for the electricity generated at the facility – and for the other four that will follow by 2020 – and it doesn't necessarily include selling it to Europe. \"By 2020, we are expecting a doubling of electricity consumption in Morocco, as the population and standard of living grow,\" he says. \"At the moment, we are 97% dependent on foreign energy which is becoming increasingly unsustainable. But we are now aiming to have 42% capacity of renewable electricity by 2020. We will build extra capacity beyond what Morocco needs if someone wants us to, but we will need a big share of the electricity produced by these projects.\" Such sentiments propose another challenge for Desertec: how will it guarantee that the electricity Europe needs is sent down the transmission cables and not just all consumed locally? And how will Mena countries justify selling the electricity to Europe – where the retail price of electricity can be up to 20 times more expensive – if the local population is, say, experiencing regular blackouts? At the visitor centre at Kuraymat, bottles of chilled water are being distributed ahead of a tour of the parabolic troughs. The mid-morning November sun is already heating the engine oil-like fluid inside the troughs' receiver tubes – a technology not that far removed from Shuman's century-old design – up towards 400C. The technical questions are coming thick and fast for Bodo Becker, the operations manager at Flagsol, the German company that specialises in building concentrated solar power (CSP) plants in the deserts of the US, Spain and now Egypt. The leading query is how the troughs perform in such harsh conditions. \"We only have one sandstorm, on average, pass through here each year,\" he says, \"but we tilt the troughs down and away from the wind whenever it gets up beyond 12 metres per second, as they act like giant sails.\" Keeping them clean is the main challenge, he adds. \"Due to the dusty conditions, we are witnessing about 2% degradation every day in performance, so we need to clean them daily. We use about 39 cubic metres of demineralised water each day for cleaning across the whole site.\" This surprises many delegates, as they have previously been told at the conference that CSP troughs need cleaning weekly compared to photovoltaic panels which need cleaning monthly. Either way, it highlights yet another challenge for Desertec: can enough local water ever be secured for cleaning duties? The Nile is just a few miles from Kuraymat, but some countries aim to push much deeper into their deserts to build such facilities. \"Dry cleaning\" technologies are being developed, but they reduce the generating efficiency at the plant. Either way, the super-heated transfer fluid requires cooling before it can loop back to the troughs for re-use, and, as with cleaning, water is the cheapest and easiest way to do this. Until \"dry cooling\" technologies are further advanced, it could limit solar farms to the desert fringes close to large bodies of water. Somewhat counter-intuitively, some countries, such as Jordan, now favour wind over solar as a source of desert energy, because it is currently more affordable and isn't so water-intensive. But it is suspected that it will be many years before a single desert energy technology comes to dominate the market. Some within the industry advocate photovoltaic panels, but, currently, CSP is more popular. However, even within CSP, there are loyalists for parabolic troughs and others for \"solar towers\", which rely on hundreds of pivoting mirrors laid out on the ground to track the sun and direct its rays towards one fixed point at the top of a giant tower. Whichever technology succeeds, it is already clear which nation in particular will win out as Desertec develops in the coming decades. One member of the visiting delegation asks Becker where the troughs are made. \"The metal cradles were made here in Egypt, but the glass troughs were all made in Germany,\" he says. \"And only two companies in the world make the glass tube receivers, which is where the main intellectual property of this technology lays – Schott Solar and Siemens.\" Both companies are German."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2011/oct/17/energy-consumption-renewables-lesson-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-17T19:29:00Z","webTitle":"How to teach … saving energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/oct/17/energy-consumption-renewables-lesson-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2011/oct/17/energy-consumption-renewables-lesson-plans","fields":{"headline":"How to teach … saving energy","bodyText":"As the nights draw in, the heating and lights go on and it's too damp to hang clothes on the line. So what better time to focus on energy consumption? Next week (24-28 October) is Energy Saving Week and the Energy Saving Trust has some useful resources on the Guardian Teacher Network, including top tips on how to save energy at home, a poster full of practical ideas (such as installing water-displacement devices) and up-to-date fact sheets on solar power, microgeneration and renewables. There is also a Guardian interactive on climate change, plus lessons on renewable energy, energy use around the world, carbon footprints and recycling. To help secondary school-aged children and sixth-formers understand the bigger picture, our Guardian interactive on everything you need to know about climate change is a must. It's an up-to-date guide to the facts of global warming, from the science and politics to economics and technology. To get to grips with the basics of renewable energy try our interactive science lesson designed for 11- to 14-year-olds on how renewable resources are used to generate electricity and on how solar energy can be used to produce hot water. After completing the lesson, children should be able to understand the advantages of using renewable and non-renewable energy as well as make predictions and find patterns in results. In geography lessons for ages 11-14, try this lesson, which uses Guardian articles to find out about the different types of energy and the environmental consequences of using energy in a non-sustainable way, and this on the main forms of energy used in Britain http://teachers.theguardian.com/ViewLesson.aspx?id=2113. The UK Association of National Park Authorities has produced some useful activities and factsheets exploring the pros and cons of windfarms here http://teachers.theguardian.com/ViewLesson.aspx?id=5135. For upper primary age-children, try this resource designed by the Saving Squad, which helps children to understand what their carbon footprint is and how to save energy. And we have some educational materials and lesson plans for 8- to 13-year-old students from Recolight, a not-for-profit organisation that funds the recycling of energy-saving light bulbs. They've commissioned specialist teachers to create a series of practical lessons for their Big Light Project, which includes an investigation of light bulbs, an energy audit and recycling.

Lawmakers were considering extending the so-called \"production tax credit\" (PTC), a provision that has catalysed hundreds of wind projects and created thousands of new jobs across the US. \"The economic benefits for consumers of wind electricity are tremendous,\" the firms wrote. Though Congress failed to renew the tax credit, clouding the future of America's wind power industry, businesses are again working to revive the PTC before it expires in December. A new business voice is emerging in Washington to reshape America's energy future along a cleaner path. With more aggressive lobbying, nitty-gritty involvement in drafting legislation and bucking the business status quo represented by the US Chamber of Commerce, these companies are engaged in Herculean effort to turn the nation away from fossil fuels embedded in the economy and politics. The strong business case for expanded renewable energy production is only part of what motivates Starbucks, Levi Strauss and others. All see a larger picture: we cannot build the healthy, sustainable global economy that powers their businesses long-term without addressing major economic threats such as climate change and natural resource scarcity. Success will require comprehensive state and national policies that encourage clean energy and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, these policies are sorely lacking. Most of the signatories to the PTC letter are members of Business for Innovative Climate &amp; Energy Policy (BICEP), an initiative formed to give business a voice on 'green' issues in Washington. Its members range from well-known food and apparel companies such as Clif Bar and Nike to the Portland Trail Blazers professional basketball team, eBay and many others. Corporate involvement in the policy arena is nothing new, of course. Businesses have always been quite adept at pursuing their self-interests through the political process, as the oil and gas industries - current beneficiaries of billions in tax breaks - clearly show. What is new is that so many companies now believe sustainability goals such as environmental protection, reduced reliance on fossil fuels and development of renewable energy are good for the planet and for business. Polar opposites, in other words, from the US Chamber of Commerce and others who see virtually all regulations that impact corporate behaviour as bad for business. \"We reject the notion that climate and energy legislation is going to be costly,\" said Stonyfield Farm founder Gary Hirschberg, one of BICEP's earliest supporters who joined 500 business executives in Washington to support climate legislation in 2010. \"Climate action offers economic opportunity rather than economic penalty.\" More than ever, the voices of businesses like these are being heard. Last year, a senior executive at apparel company Timberland testified before Congress on efforts by House Republicans to limit the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to curb greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. \"Preventing EPA from exercising its authority, or rolling back any of its actions, would cost the economy in human health, in terms of illness that often results in lost work days, and more,\" she told the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The rollback effort subsequently failed. Corporate sustainability activism is also reaching beyond Washington to the state level. BICEP companies played a leading role in fending off a repeal of California's landmark climate law. They also led in advocating for stronger national automobile fuel economy standards - now set to go into effect this fall. In other regions, corporations are working hand-in-hand with lawmakers to encourage clean energy development. When BICEP member company eBay wanted to use clean solar energy to power an expanded data centre facility in the state of Utah, it required a change in state law. Together with Rocky Mountain Power, the state's largest electric utility, other high-tech companies such as Google and Oracle, and a Republican state senator, they crafted legislation this spring to make renewable energy available to large energy users and create a real alternative to coal-fired generation. That legislation is now law. \"I'm looking for choice in a state, and if I want clean power I want to be able to get it. That's what this law does,\" said eBay's global data centre strategy director Dean Nelson, who is already planning to build a second data centre and add nearly 2,200 new jobs in the state. The law will also help eBay diversify its energy portfolio, providing a hedge against volatile fossil fuel prices. Other businesses are flexing their muscles in different ways. Aspen Ski Company, a major ski area operator facing shorter ski seasons as global temperatures rise, is taking on the US Chamber for its resistance to climate change policies. Last month, it led a successful effort to have the Aspen Chamber of Commerce disassociate itself from the national organisation. Although many companies are disheartened by the current dysfunction in Washington, one former US Department of Energy official recently appealed for businesses interested in clean energy policies not to disengage. \"Please do not abandon Washington,\" former US Department of Energy official Cathy Zoi recently told an audience convened by Fortune magazine. \"This is important…because you guys are thinking about reliable, affordable electricity, and Washington needs to know that you care about it.\" Even today, with a presidential race slowing national policy-making to a crawl, companies like Levi Strauss see opportunities for positive action. \"In an election year…companies should use this time to create a foundation of support for when the policy environment is more ripe for action,\" Anna Walker, senior manager of government affairs and public policy at Levi Strauss, told an audience in Boston last week. \"Like the Chinese proverb of a thousand cups of tea, this is an opportunity to build relationships with policymakers, to tell your story, and strengthen alliances with like-minded companies and organisations,\" Walker added. \"In a time when big action won't happen, those smaller actions - those cups of tea - can help secure change for the future.\" Mindy Lubber is president of Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group that works with leading US companies and investors.

The hi-tech structures sit incongruously alongside the tents and rough stone buildings of the Palestinian village, but they are fundamental to life here: they provide electricity. Imneizil is not connected to the national electricity grid. Nor are the vast majority of Palestinian communities in Area C, the 62% of the West Bank controlled by Israel. The solar energy has replaced expensive and clunky oil-powered generators. According to the Israeli authorities, these solar panels – along with six others in nearby villages – are illegal and have been slated for demolition. Nihad Moor, 25, has three small children. The family live in a two-room tent kitted out with a fridge, TV and very old computer. She also has a small electric butter churn, which she uses to supplement her husband's small income from sheep farming. \"The kids get sick all the time. At the moment, because of a change in the weather, they all have colds. Without electricity I wouldn't even be able to see to help them when they need to use the [outdoor] toilet at night,\" Moor says. \"I don't want to imagine what life would be like here if [the panels] were demolished.\" Imneizil's solar system was built in 2009 by the Spanish NGO Seba at a cost of €30,000 to the Spanish government. According to the Israeli authorities, it was built without a permit. Guy Inbar, a spokesperson for the Israeli authorities in the West Bank, explains: \"International aid is an important component in improving and promoting the quality of life of the Palestinian population but this does not grant immunity for illegal or unco-ordinated activity.\" The problem for Palestinian communities here is that permission to build any infrastructure is very hard to come by. According to figures from the civil administration quoted by the pressure group Peace Now, 91 permits were issued for Palestinian construction in Area C between 2001 and 2007. In the same period, more than 10,000 Israeli settlement units were built and1,663 Palestinian structures demolished. The Jewish settlements in Area C are connected to the national water and electricity grids. But most Palestinian villages are cut off from basic infrastructure, including water and sewage services. Imneizil, which borders the ultra-religious settlement of Beit Yatir, currently has nine demolition orders on various structures, including a toilet block and water cistern for the school. Comet ME is an Israeli NGO trying to circumvent these crippling restrictions on Palestinian development by harnessing Hebron's abundant natural energy sources – wind and sun. Funded largely by the German government, the organisation has already provided tens of Palestinian villages with electricity through solar panels and wind turbines. Its goal is to reach all villages in the southern Hebron area by the end of 2013. \"In technical terms it's do-able, but it depends on Israeli policies,\" says Elad Orian, Comet ME's founder. \"Power is a human right, like housing and education,\" he says. \"We deal with providing basic energy services. Renewable energy provides the best route to do it.\" The green energy solution has its flaws. At a cost of around $4,500 per family, it is expensive. Nor does it generate enough electricity to sustain a community. But it has offered a lifeline to the 150,000 Palestinians living in Area C's impoverished communities. However, it will become increasingly difficult to convince donors that alternative energy is worth investing in if the expensive technology they are funding is destroyed. After the order issued against the Imneizil solar panels in September, six alternative energy systems built by Comet ME in Hebron have received demolition orders. A legal fight waged by Rabbis for Human Rights has succeeded in suspending, but not lifting, the demolition of Imneizil's panels. The German foreign office has launched an intense diplomatic effort to save the others in nearby villages. One UN expert, speaking anonymously as they are not authorised to talk to the media, believes the crackdown on the alternative energy movement by the Israelis is part of a deliberate strategy in Area C. \"From December 2010 to April 2011, we saw a systematic targeting of the water infrastructure in Hebron, Bethlehem and the Jordan valley,\" the source said. \"Now, in the last couple of months, they are targeting electricity. Two villages in the area have had their electrical poles demolished. \"There is this systematic effort by the civil administration targeting all Palestinian infrastructure in Hebron. They are hoping that by making it miserable enough, they [the Palestinians] will pick up and leave.\" According to UN research, that is happening. Ten out of 13 Palestinian communities living in Area C surveyed by the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs in 2011 reported that families had already left their land as a result of Israeli policies. Ali Mohamed Hraizat, 49, head of Imneizil's village council, fears that if the solar panels are destroyed, his community will see an exodus. \"We've been here since 1948. We try to stay and maintain our lives, but people will leave if the electricity is cut off,\" he says. \"They are used for light for their children to study by and for televisions. They will move into town. The solar panel isn't doing any harm … I just don't see the point in demolishing it.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jan/12/china-renewable-energy-coal-consumption","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-12T11:31:31Z","webTitle":"China's renewables surge dampened by growth in coal consumption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/12/china-renewable-energy-coal-consumption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jan/12/china-renewable-energy-coal-consumption","fields":{"headline":"China's renewables surge dampened by growth in coal consumption","bodyText":"China tripled its solar energy generating capacity last year and notched up major increases in wind and hydropower, government figures showed this week, but officials are still struggling to cap the growth in coal burning, which is the biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world. The latest evidence of China's promotion of renewable energy has been welcomed by climate activists, but they warn that the benefits are being wiped out by the surge in coal consumption. After burning an extra 95m tonnes last year, China will soon account for half the coal burned on the planet. This has alarmed state planners concerned about the impact of air pollution and climate change, but their efforts to cap the nation's energy consumption are said to have run into resistance from local governments who fear restrictions on economic growth. At a key policymaking meeting in Beijing this week, Liu Tienan – the director of the National Energy Administration – called for energy use to be kept below 4.1bn tonnes of coal equivalent per year by 2015. If the proposal is accepted, this would be the first time China has set such a ceiling. Until now, Beijing has only set goals for energy and carbon intensity, which are relative to economic growth and so fluctuate according to GDP figures. But the proposed figure remains the subject of fierce discussion as it was based on an assumption that China's economy will grow at 7.5% per annum up until 2015, by which time the government is supposed to bring down energy intensity (units of energy per unit of GDP) by 16%. However, provincial governments are projecting a combined economic growth rate of more than 9%, which means they will face a fuel shortfall unless the energy target are raised or they fail to reach their goals. The negotiations are held behind closed doors and are likely to last several more months, but it is believed that the provinces are arguing for a higher target of between 4.25 and 5 bn tonnes. As well as being distant from the current reality of a slowing economy – the forecast for the first six months of this year is for no more than 7.5% growth – this prospect horrifies environmentalists. \"If it goes up to 5bn tonnes, it would be a disaster; China would effectively be promoting high-energy, high-carbon growth,\" said Li Yan of Greenpeace. If accepted, an energy cap would immediately become one of the most important industrial targets in the world because it would largely determine how large a mountain of coal China burns and, as a result, how much CO2 it emits. Depending on how it was structured, such a target could also help or hinder the development of the renewable energy industry. China continued to make rapid progress in this field last year, according to figures published on the website of the National Energy Administration. They show a rise of 47GW in wind power generating capacity, and the completion of an extra 12.6 gigawatts of hydropower, with almost twice that amount also likely to come on line this year. The UK has 75GW of energy capacity, of all types. The most spectacular growth, however, was in photovoltaic power generation, which rose threefold to 3GW, the administration noted. Yet coal continues to account for close to 70% of the nation's power supply. The government is trying to bring this proportion down below 65%, but it is not making progress fast enough. Yang Fuqiang of the US-headquartered NGO National Resources Defence Council, said Chinese energy consumption rose almost threefold from 2000 to reach 3.2bn tonnes of coal equivalent in 2010. On current trends it will rise to almost 5bn tonnes by 2020. \"We must do something about this,\" said Yang, a former government official. China uses too much coal. It's the source of carbon emissions and pollution.\" Yang wants the government to change its proposed energy cap into a coal cap, which would allow provincial authorities to grow faster if they used more renewable energy or gas. The debate is expected to continued for several more months with targets for the provinces unlikely to be released before the summer. • Additional research by Cecily Huang • Get the Guardian's environment news on your iPhone with our new app. You can also join us on Twitter, Facebook and Google+"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
